        "explain": "INDRIK SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating Dridex since June 2014. In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted INDRIK SPIDER millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware. In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by INDRIK SPIDER, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.The beginning of 2017 also brought a turning point in INDRIK SPIDER’s operation of Dridex. Dridex spam campaigns significantly declined, with new campaigns moving from high volume and frequency, to smaller, targeted distribution. The rapid development of Dridex also slowed during this time, with fewer versions released during 2017 than in previous years. CrowdStrike® Falcon® Intelligence™ also observed a strong correlation between Dridex infections and BitPaymer ransomware. During incidents that involved BitPaymer, Dridex was installed on the victim network prior to the deployment of the BitPaymer malware. Also unusual was the observation that both Dridex and BitPaymer were spread through the victim network using lateral movement techniques traditionally associated with nation-state actors and penetration testing. These new tactics of selectively targeting organizations for high ransomware payouts have signaled a shift in INDRIK SPIDER’s operation with a new focus on targeted, low-volume, high-return criminal activity: a type of cybercrime operation we refer to as big game hunting. Since this shift, INDRIK SPIDER has used BitPaymer ransomware as a key vehicle for these operations, having netted around $1.5M USD in the first 15 months of ransomware operations.Falcon Intelligence has provided support to multiple active BitPaymer incident response (IR) engagements. The information gathered from these engagements, combined with information from prior Dridex IR engagements, provides insight into how INDRIK SPIDER deploys and operates both Dridex and BitPaymer. An overview of this process is provided below in Figure 1.Falcon Intelligence has provided support to multiple active BitPaymer incident response (IR) engagements. The information gathered from these engagements, combined with information from prior Dridex IR engagements, provides insight into how INDRIK SPIDER deploys and operates both Dridex and BitPaymer. An overview of this process is provided below in Figure 1.After the initial compromise, Falcon Intelligence observed both the Dridex loader and PowerShell Empire in operation on the infected host. PowerShell Empire is a post-exploitation agent built for penetration testing, which was used to move laterally between hosts. When moving between hosts, the PowerShell Empire agent was run as a service with the name Updater, as shown below in Figure 2.During this lateral movement, Falcon Intelligence also observed PowerShell Empire deploying the Mimikatz module on servers in the victim’s network. Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool used to harvest credentials from Windows hosts. These compromised credentials were then used for further lateral movement. For many of the hosts that PowerShell Empire moved to, it would download and install the Dridex loader. The lateral movement continued until the domain credentials for the environment were retrieved and both PowerShell Empire and the Dridex loader were installed on the domain controllers in the environment. This process appears to be automated based on the speed at which the hosts are compromised. Though traditionally used to load modules for fraud activity, recent updates to the Dridex loader also allow it to perform system and network reconnaissance. These reconnaissance capabilities include the ability to collect information about the current user on the host, list computers on the local network, and extract the system’s environment variables. This information is likely used to assist with identifying interesting targets within the victim network. In some instances, Falcon Intelligence observed several days of inactivity between the time the domain controllers were compromised and the installation of BitPaymer. This delay may indicate that the operators were performing reconnaissance and gathering information about the victim before deciding how best to monetize the compromise.Falcon Intelligence has observed two different methods used to deploy BitPaymer once the domain controllers are compromised. In one instance, only the domain controllers and other critical infrastructure, like payroll servers, were targeted and PowerShell Empire was used to download and execute the BitPaymer malware directly on these servers. In another instance, the BitPaymer malware was downloaded to a network share in the victim network, and a startup script called gpupdate.bat was pushed to all the hosts on the network via Group Policy Object (GPO), from the domain controllers. This script copied BitPaymer from the share and executed it on each host in the network, encrypting thousands of machines. This targeted deployment methodology involving credential compromise, lateral movement, and the use of system administrator tools closely mimics behavior Falcon Intelligence has observed from nation-state adversary groups, and penetration testing teams. With the move to targeting select victims for high-value payouts, the INDRIK SPIDER adversary group is no longer forced to scale its operations, and now has the capacity to tailor its tooling to the victim’s environment and play a more active role in the compromise with “hands on keyboard” activity.Though the first publicly reported use of BitPaymer was in August 2017, when the malware was linked to ransomware attacks against several NHS hospitals, it was first identified in July 2017 by Twitter user Michael Gillespie. Later, in January 2018, a report was released that identified similarities between the BitPaymer ransomware and Dridex malware. The report authors renamed the malware “FriedEx.” Falcon Intelligence has analyzed this malware and can confirm the overlap between BitPaymer/FriedEx and Dridex malware. Due to the targeted nature of the ransomware, BitPaymer is custom-built for each operation, with a unique encryption key, a ransom note and contact information embedded in it. As a result of this customization, there are multiple builds of the malware, though Falcon Intelligence has identified two main variants: an older variant that splits the encryption process into multiple “modes” with each mode focused on a specific task; and a newer variant that is built to be run as a service.During analysis, Falcon Intelligence obtained builds of the ransomware that contained the program database (PDB) string S:\\Work\\_bin\\Release-Win32\\wp_encrypt.pdb. Based on this string, the malware developers refer to this ransomware as wp_encrypt. The PDB string also contains the prefix string S:\\Work\\, which is identical to other Dridex modules, including those shown in Table 1. The ransomware also contains code from the Dridex modules, with some variants of the ransomware sharing up to 69 percent of their code with the Dridex loader.Both variants of the BitPaymer malware feature multiple techniques to hinder analysis. The malware developers have employed a combination of encrypted strings, string hashes and dynamic API resolution to ensure that no strings exist in the binary.The BitPaymer malware contains a small table of encrypted strings in the rdata section of the binary. These strings use standard RC4 encryption in which the first 40 bytes form the RC4 key, and the remaining data contains the encrypted strings table. These strings are temporarily decrypted on-demand during runtime. The strings in the decrypted strings table are separated by a null byte and are referenced by their order. This string table encryption method is identical to the method used in other Dridex malware, including the 40-byte key length and the position of the table in the rdata section. The strings table includes, among other strings, the RSA public key used in the ransomware encryption, the ransom note, file extensions and the encryption target flags string.In addition to the encrypted strings table, BitPaymer replaces the remaining strings in the binary with hashes and uses an algorithm to match these hashes with strings that exist on the host. For example, when setting the run key for persistence, instead of simply opening the registry key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run, BitPaymer uses the API RegEnumKeyW to iterate through all the registry keys, comparing their hash value until the correct key has been located. The hashing algorithm generates a CRC32 hash of the string, converted to lowercase. This hash is combined with a DWORD using a simple XOR. This DWORD is different for each build of the malware. This string hashing algorithm is identical to the hashing algorithm used in other Dridex modules. The hash algorithm has been replicated in Python below.The Windows APIs that are used in the malware are resolved dynamically at runtime. For each API, the function name and DLL name are hashed and stored in the binary. At runtime, when the API is needed, the malware will iterate through all DLLs in the Windows system directory, comparing a hash of their name with a precomputed DLL hash until it has been located. The malware will then load the DLL and iterate through the export table comparing a hash of the API name with the expected hash until it has been located. The hashing algorithm used for the API names is the same CRC32 algorithm used for the string hashes. However, when hashing the DLL names, BitPaymer converts the strings to uppercase before hashing them. This process is also used in other Dridex modules.The older “mode” variant of BitPaymer uses the Windows registry for persistence, while the newer service variant will attempt to install itself as a service. If that fails, it will fall back to using the Windows registry. The older “mode” variant will first copy itself to either the %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local or the %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\LocalLow directory, depending on its process integrity level. Then it will add a new registry value to the registry key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the path to the newly copied malware. The registry value name is a randomly generated string between five and fifteen characters, containing upper and lowercase letters as well as numbers.When the newer service variant of BitPaymer is run, it first determines if it is being executed from an alternate data stream. If it is not executed from an alternate data stream, the malware creates a file in the %APPDATA% folder with a random file name between three and eight characters long, containing uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers. It then copies itself to the alternate data stream :bin of the newly created file and creates a new process from the stream. When the malware is executed from the alternate data stream, it checks the process integrity level. If it is not running with a level above medium integrity, it attempts to elevate its privileges. To suppress the User Access Control (UAC) prompt that normally occurs during privilege elevation, the malware uses a UAC bypass technique first documented in August 2016. This bypass requires temporarily setting either the registry key HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command on Windows 10, or the registry key HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\mscfile\\shell\\open\\command on Windows 7 to execute the malware. Once the registry key is set, the malware launches the Windows event viewer process eventvwr.msc, which will inadvertently launch the malware set in the registry keys with elevated privileges.If elevated privileges are not obtained, the malware falls back to using the same Windows registry run key as the older mode variant for persistence HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. However, if the malware is successful in elevating privileges, it begins to enumerate existing Windows services on the host that are configured to run as LocalSystem. The malware selects services that are currently not active and ignores services that launch the executables svchost.exe and lsass.exe. For each service, the malware attempts to take control of the service’s executable — first using icacls.exe with the /reset flag to reset the executable’s permissions, then using takeown.exe with the /F flag to take ownership of the executable. If this is successful, the malware creates a :0 alternate data stream in the executable and copies the executable’s own contents to the stream. This can be used to restore the executable later. Then the malware replaces the contents of the executable with a copy of itself and launches the service. The file modified time of the executable is also artificially changed to 00:00:00 UTC. The purpose of this time change is so the file can be identified and restored by the decryption tool. Once a service has been successfully hijacked and launched, the malware stops attempting to hijack the remaining services and exits. If there are no services matching the selection criteria, BitPaymer simply exits and no files are encrypted.Before encryption, both variants of BitPaymer attempt to remove the backup shadow files from the host, making it impossible to restore encrypted files. This is achieved by launching the vssadmin.exe process with the following command vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet.There is a string present in the strings table that works like a configuration flag for the encryption targets of the malware. The string may contain a combination of the letters F, R, N, and S. During the encryption process, the letters in this flag are checked to determine what drive types to encrypt. The corresponding drive types for each letter are described below in Table 2. All BitPaymer samples analyzed by Falcon Intelligence had all four flags enabled for maximum encryption.In order to encrypt network shares, BitPaymer will attempt to enumerate the sessions for each user logged onto the infected host and create a new process, using the token of each user. These new processes will first spawn a net.exe processing with the view argument to gather a list of network accessible hosts. For each host, BitPaymer spawns another net.exe process with command net view using the newly discovered host as a parameter. This will return a list of network shares available to the impersonated user on the host. Once a list of all available shares has been gathered, BitPaymer attempts to mount them to be encrypted.For each drive targeted, the malware recursively iterates through all files and directories. For each file, the name and path are compared against a list of excluded filenames and two lists of excluded directory names. These exclusion lists are composed of regular expression type strings that are located in the encrypted strings table. If the file name and path do not match any regular expressions in the exclusion lists, the file is encrypted.The file encryption algorithm imports a hard-coded RSA 1024-bit public key from the encrypted strings table using CryptImportPublicKeyInfo, and for each file, generates a 128-bit RC4 key using CryptGenKey. The RC4 key is then used to encrypt the file in place. Once it is encrypted, the file is moved to a new file with the same name, and the file extension is appended with the keyword .locked.The RC4 key is exported as a SIMPLEBLOB encrypted with the RSA key and Base64-encoded. A second file is created with the same name as the encrypted file, except it is appended with the extension .readme_txt. A ransom note is written to this file, and the RSA-encrypted, Base64-encoded RC4 key is appended to this file along with the KEY: string. An example of the ransom note with the appended key is shown in Figure 3.Because the key is not appended to the encrypted file but instead written to a separate file, if the file containing the ransom note is accidentally deleted or moved to a separate directory, the encrypted file will become unrecoverable. There is some indication that this may have occurred in the past, as newer ransom notes include specific warnings about touching the readme_txt files, while older versions of the ransom notes do not. The text from a newer ransom note is provided below in Figure 4.The language in the ransom notes indicate that this ransomware is targeted specifically at companies, not individuals. The notes also contain a threat to leak private information that has been collected from the target if the ransom is not paid. Though there is no functionality to collect this information in the ransomware itself, the ransomware is deployed by INDRIK SPIDER in parallel with Dridex malware, and the Dridex malware contains modules that may be used to collect information from infected hosts. The use of an embedded RSA public key also indicates that each build of the ransomware binary is unique to a specific target. By design, the decryption tool needs to contain the corresponding RSA private key so if the same build is used for multiple targets, the ransom would only need to be paid once to acquire the private key, which could then be used to decrypt all the infections. Falcon Intelligence has acquired multiple decryption tools related to BitPaymer, which confirm the theory that a unique key is used for each infection.Information provided in Bitpaymer ransom notes has continued to change, with the first change coming shortly after the first identified campaign in July 2017. Initially INDRIK SPIDER provided all required information in either the ransom note or through a TOR-based payment portal, meaning the victim could make the payment with very little interaction with the actor. However, later notes removed this key information forcing the victims to email the INDRIK SPIDER campaign operator for payment and decryption details. A table of observed ransom note changes can be seen below.By removing the ransom demand from the note, INDRIK SPIDER can change the amount based on campaign success, which likely depends on the size of the organization and the speed of initial contact from the victim.Unlike many ransomware operations, which usually just require victims to make the payment and subsequently download a decryptor, INDRIK SPIDER requires the victim to engage in communication with an operator. Falcon Intelligence has had unique insight into the email dialogue between a victim and an INDRIK SPIDER operator. This dialogue has revealed details about how the adversary approaches payment negotiation with the victim, as well as the communication of decryption instructions. Initial victim communication with the INDRIK SPIDER operator, using one of the email addresses provided, results in the operator providing key pieces of information up front, such as the BTC address and the ransom amount. INDRIK SPIDER is also willing to demonstrate decryption legitimacy by offering to decrypt two test files of the victim’s choice. It was made clear during communications that INDRIK SPIDER is not willing to negotiate on the ransom amount, explicitly stating that the victim can use multiple Bitcoin exchanges to obtain the number of BTC required, and the exchange rate should be calculated based on the rate posted on the cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex. Ransom demands have varied between requesting an exact USD value in BTC and an exact number of BTC, which is likely due to the continued fluctuation in the BTC-to-USD value. In communications with INDRIK SPIDER, the victim is told to use any BTC exchange from the top 10 and seek help from local information technology (IT) support companies. Of note, INDRIK SPIDER specifies the geographical location of where the victim should seek help, confirming that they know key information about the victim. Once payment has been made, INDRIK SPIDER acknowledges receipt and states that the decryptor will be “delivered within a few hours.” Though earlier in the communication process, a one-hour time window for delivery of the decrypter is promised upon receipt of payment, the decryptor was actually delivered closer to four hours after payment. This discrepancy could be due to the difference in time zones and working hours of the INDRIK SPIDER operator. INDRIK SPIDER uses file sharing platforms to distribute the BitPaymer decryptor. In an extensive email to the victim, the INDRIK SPIDER operator provides a decryptor download link, decryptor deletion link (to be used following decryptor download) and a password. The same email also provides clear instructions on how to download and use the BitPaymer decryptor, including how to remove the malware persistence. The operator also states that they will be able to provide assistance using the same email address for a further period of time, which is usually until the end of the current work week. Interestingly, INDRIK SPIDER provides the victim with several key security recommendations to follow that may ultimately avoid further breaches (see Figure 5). The recommendations provided are not only good advice, but also provide indications of how INDRIK SPIDER breaches organizations and moves laterally until domain controller access is gained.Ransom demands have varied significantly, suggesting that INDRIK SPIDER likely calculates the ransom amount based on the size and value of the victim organization. The lowest identified payment was for approximately $10,000 USD, and the highest observed was for close to $200,000 USD.As of Nov. 1, 2018, Falcon Intelligence had observed a total of 185.7 BTC paid to INDRIK-SPIDER-controlled BTC addresses, with a USD total of $1,554,977 based on BTC-to-USD value at the time the ransom payment was made.The process tree for BitPaymer, as seen by the Falcon sensor, is shown below in Figure 6. To prevent BitPaymer from encrypting files on the host, Falcon Prevent™ next-generation antivirus must kill the ransomware process (KX9OGR~1:BIN) prior to execution of the file encryption routines.Falcon Prevent provides two layers of defense to protect against ransomware threats like BitPaymer: indicators of attack (IOAs) and machine learning (ML). Either one of these defenses is enough to stop the BitPaymer process before it can encrypt any files. Figure 7 below shows an example of an IOA prevention alert that is sent to the centralized Falcon console. In this case, BitPaymer’s attempt to delete the backup shadow files triggered the IOA that led to the prevention of this process. Had a prevention not existed for this IOA, BitPaymer would still have been prevented with CrowdStrike Falcon®’s ML. Below, Figure 7 shows CrowdStrike ML detecting the BitPaymer binary as malicious.Had a prevention not existed for this IOA, BitPaymer would still have been prevented with CrowdStrike Falcon®’s ML capabilities. Below, Figure 8 shows CrowdStrike ML detecting the BitPaymer binary as malicious.INDRIK SPIDER consists of experienced malware developers and operators who have likely been part of the group since the early days of Dridex operations, beginning in June 2014. The formation of the group and the modus operandi changed significantly in early 2017. Dridex operations became more targeted, resulting in less distribution and Dridex sub-botnets in operation, and BitPaymer ransomware operations began in July 2017. There is no doubt that BitPaymer ransomware operations are proving successful for this criminal group, with an average estimate take of over $200,000 USD per victim, but it is also important to remember that INDRIK SPIDER continues to operate the Dridex banking trojan. Though Dridex is still bringing in criminal revenue for the actor after almost four years of operation, targeted wire fraud operations likely require lengthy planning. Therefore, a ransomware operation provides high-value income for the actor for a lot less expenditure, both in operator and development costs. Falcon Intelligence anticipates that INDRIK SPIDER will continue to operate both Dridex and BitPaymer, with the two monetization strategies complementing each other. In scenarios where wire fraud is not as lucrative an option, INDRIK SPIDER might use ransomware to monetize the compromise instead. What is clear though, is that the low-scale, selective targeting and high payout tactics of big game hunting is proving to be a winning strategy for INDRIK SPIDER. INDRIK SPIDER isn’t the only criminal actor running big game hunting operations; The first ransomware to stake a claim for big game hunting was Samas (aka SamSam), which is developed and operated by BOSS SPIDER. Since they were first identified in January 2-16, this adversary has consistently targeted large organizations for high ransom demands. In July 2017, INDRIK SPIDER joined the movement of targeted ransomware with BitPaymer. Most recently, the ransomware known as Ryuk came to market in August 2017 and has netted its operators, tracked by Falcon Intelligence as GRIM SPIDER, a significant (and immediate) profit in campaigns also targeting large organizations. Falcon Intelligence anticipates that big game hunting operations will continue to grow. The criminal actors INDRIK SPIDER, BOSS SPIDER, and GRIM SPIDER will sustain their operations in the near-term. It is also likely that other criminal actors are considering the option of running sophisticated ransomware operations. Given the tools, skilled campaign operators and malware required, it is likely there will still be only a handful of criminal groups able to do so in the near future; however, Falcon Intelligence considers this to be a growing eCrime threat.\n\n\n",

This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA)—coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Energy (DOE)—provides information on multiple intrusion campaigns conducted by state-sponsored Russian cyber actors from 2011 to 2018 and targeted U.S. and international Energy Sector organizations. CISA, the FBI, and DOE responded to these campaigns with appropriate action in and around the time that they occurred. CISA, the FBI, and DOE are sharing this information in order to highlight historical tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries to target U.S. and international Energy Sector organizations. On March 24, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments of three Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers and a Russian Federation Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) employee for their involvement in the following intrusion campaigns against U.S. and international oil refineries, nuclear facilities, and energy companies.Global Energy Sector Intrusion Campaign, 2011 to 2018: the FSB conducted a multi-stage campaign in which they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks, deployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data. One of the indicted FSB officers was involved in campaign activity that involved deploying Havex malware to victim networks. The other two indicted FSB officers were involved in activity targeting U.S. Energy Sector networks from 2016 through 2018. Compromise of Middle East-based Energy Sector organization with TRITON Malware, 2017: Russian cyber actors with ties to the TsNIIKhM gained access to and leveraged TRITON (also known as HatMan) malware to manipulate a foreign oil refinery’s ICS controllers. TRITON was designed to specifically target Schneider Electric’s Triconex Tricon safety systems and is capable of disrupting those systems. Schneider Electric has issued a patch to mitigate the risk of the TRITON malware’s attack vector; however, network defenders should install the patch and remain vigilant against these threat actors’ TTPs. The indicted TsNIIKhM cyber actor is charged with attempt to access U.S. protected computer networks and to cause damage to an energy facility. The indicted TsNIIKhM cyber actor was a co-conspirator in the deployment of the TRITON malware in 2017. This CSA provides the TTPs used by indicted FSB and TsNIIKhM actors in cyber operations against the global Energy Sector. Specifically, this advisory maps TTPs used in the global Energy Sector campaign and the compromise of the Middle East-based Energy Sector organization to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise and ATT&CK for ICS frameworks. CISA, the FBI, and DOE assess that state-sponsored Russian cyber operations continue to pose a threat to U.S. Energy Sector networks. CISA, the FBI, and DOE urge the Energy Sector and other critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory and Appendix A to reduce the risk of compromise. For more information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA's Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage. For more information on the threat of Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors to U.S. critical infrastructure as well as additional mitigation recommendations, see joint CSA Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure and CISA's Shields Up Technical Guidance webpage.

For more details refer to rewardsforjustice.net.From at least 2011 through 2018, the FSB (also known as Berserk Bear, Energetic Bear, TeamSpy, Dragonfly, Havex, Crouching Yeti, and Koala) conducted an intrusion campaign against international and U.S. Energy Sector organizations. The threat actor gained remote access to and deployed malware designed to collect ICS-related information on compromised Energy Sector networks, and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS data. Beginning in 2013 and continuing through 2014, the threat actor leveraged Havex malware on Energy Sector networks. The threat actor gained access to these victim networks via spearphishing emails, redirects to compromised websites, and malicious versions of legitimate software updates on multiple ICS vendor websites. The new software updates contained installations of Havex malware, which infected systems of users who downloaded the compromised updates. Havex is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that communicates with a command and control (C2) server. The C2 server deploys payloads that enumerate all collected network resources and uses the Open Platform Communications (OPC) standard to gather information about connected control systems devices and resources within the network. Havex allowed the actor to install additional malware and extract data, including system information, lists of files and installed programs, e-mail address books, and virtual private network (VPN) configuration files. The Havex payload can cause common OPC platforms to crash, which could cause a denial-of-service condition on applications that rely on OPC communications. Note: for additional information on Havex, see to CISA ICS Advisory ICS Focused Malware and CISA ICS Alert ICS Focused Malware (Update A). Beginning in 2016, the threat actor began widely targeting U.S. Energy Sector networks. The actor conducted these attacks in two stages: first targeting third-party commercial organizations (such as vendors, integrators, and suppliers) and then targeting Energy Sector organizations. The threat actor used the compromised third-party infrastructure to conduct spearphishing, watering hole, and supply chain attacks to harvest Energy Sector credentials and to pivot to Energy Sector enterprise networks. After obtaining access to the U.S. Energy Sector networks, the actor conducted network discovery, moved laterally, gained persistence, then collected and exfiltrated information pertaining to ICS from the enterprise, and possibly operational technology (OT), environments. Exfiltrated information included: vendor information, reference documents, ICS architecture, and layout diagrams. In 2017, Russian cyber actors with ties to TsNIIKhM gained access to and manipulated a foreign oil refinery’s safety devices. TsNIIKhM actors used TRITON malware on the ICS controllers, which resulted in the refinery shutting down for several days. TRITON is a custom-built, sophisticated, multi-stage malware affecting Schneider Electric’s Triconex Tricon, a safety programmable logic controller (PLC) (also referred to as a safety instrumented system [SIS]), which monitors industrial processes to prevent hazardous conditions. TRITON is capable of directly interacting with, remotely controlling, and compromising these safety systems. As these systems are used in a large number of environments, the capacity to disable, inhibit, or modify the ability of a process to fail safely could result in physical consequences.TRITON malware affects Triconex Tricon PLCs by modifying in-memory firmware to add additional programming. The extra functionality allows an attacker to read/modify memory contents and execute custom code, disabling the safety system. TRITON malware has multiple components, including a custom Python script, four Python modules, and malicious shellcode that contains an injector and a payload. For detailed information on TRITON’s components, refer to CISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR): HatMan: Safety System Targeted Malware (Update B).\n\n\n",

Each of these three APTs seem to fill a different role within Russia’s infrastructure hacking: Sandworm is one of Russia’s most destructive hacking teams, responsible for attacks which shut off Ukrainian power grids in 2015 and 2016; Dragonfly appears to primarily be an intelligence gathering threat actor observed in a large number of Industrial Control System (ICS) networks but never reported escalating to disruptive or destructive attacks; and finally, XENOTIME, the most elusive of the three, exhibits targeting behavior characterized by an ability to tailor malware to specific industrial control systems, as evidenced by their Trisis/Triton malware that affected Saudi pipeline safety systems.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "TeamTNT is a threat group that was known for primarily targeting the cloud and container environments around the world. This group has been documented to leverage the cloud and container resources by deploying cryptocurrency miners in the victim environments. While the group has been active since 2019 and announced it was quitting in 2021, our recent observations make it appear as if TeamTNT has returned — or a copycat group imitating the routines of TeamTNT — and has been deploying an XMRig cryptocurrency miner. Analysis of the attack patterns and other technical details of the code has also led us to believe that the routines are mimicking TeamTNT’s arsenal, but are likely deployed by another cryptocurrency mining group named WatchDog.We tracked the majority of these IP addresses to have established connections from China while one came from Germany, making a series of requests to the exposed Docker API as follows: The initial request made was to get the Docker version information.As seen in the User-Agent header field, this request seems like TeamTNT is using the legitimate utility ZGrab to scan for publicly exposed Docker API servers. Go-developed ZGrab is a banner-grabbing tool that is currently being deprecated. A newer version called ZGrab2 is the open-source tool currently available in GitHub. We observed the older utility being used in the malicious sample we analyzed. Once the request identifies the available servers, the routine moves to the next steps. A ping request checks if the API server is live.Once the ping response is positive, the attackers perform a request to deploy the /containers/create endpoint to deploy an alpine-based container with instructions to download and execute the malicious shell script. Once the container deployment is successful, the attacker requests the Docker Daemon API to attach to the container and start it.The cronb.sh script is the first payload deployed by the attacker. We analyzed this script performing many actions, downloading multiple shell scripts and an XMRIG miner, and compiling the Base64-encoded c code, among others. In this section, we summarize the actions performed by the script.The beginning functions of the script contains the command and control (C&C) server IP and port details.The check_exist function checks if the miner process is running on the defined port 1414 with the help of netstat.The m_command function’s script sets the path of wget, curl, and chattr utilities. This process renames the chattr utility to zzhcht, probably so that other miners or malware would not be able to use this utility.The threat actor also hijacks the various system binaries, creates custom processes, and renames them with a tnt prefix, or TNTcurl, curltnt, and tntrecht suffixes. In this function, the script also checks if the binaries tntcurl or curltnt exists or not, and adds their path as environment variables. This has also been documented previously and attributed to TeamTNT.The ins_function function calls three functions after validating the package managers used in the operating system (OS) to install tools like gcc, make, and kmod to compile and install the source codes of rootkit and process hider code.In this function, the script configures the network settings to use the IP addresses 8[.]8[.]8[.]8 and 8[.]8[.]4[.]4 as the domain name system (DNS) servers via updating /etc/resolv.conf file by changing the file permissions to make it mutable. The said addresses are Google DNS servers.The download_f function downloads the XMRig miner xm.tar as crypto and the configuration file config.json as [cmake].pid, which contains the pool server IP address under the /usr/share directory.The setup_s function installs the configuration file [cmake].pid as a service in the system under path .The makesshaxx function’s script adds the attacker’s secure shell (SSH) public key in the files /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and /root/.ssh/authorized_keys2. The SSH public key we found: ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCmEFN80ELqVV9enSOn+05vOhtmmtuEoPFhompw+bTIaCDsU5Yn2yD77Yifc/yXh3O9mg76THr7vxomguO040VwQYf9+vtJ6CGtl7NamxT8LYFBgsgtJ9H48R9k6H0rqK5Srdb44PGtptZR7USzjb02EUq/15cZtfWnjP9pKTgscOvU6o1Jpos6kdlbwzNggdNrHxKqps0so3GC7tXv/GFlLVWEqJRqAVDOxK4Gl2iozqxJMO2d7TCNg7d3Rr3w4xIMNZm49DPzTWQcze5XciQyNoNvaopvp+UlceetnWxI1Kdswi0VNMZZOmhmsMAtirB3yR10DwH3NbEKy+ohYqBL root@puppetserver A quick Google search showed that this key was previously used in other scripts related to Docker container attacks.The clean_monitor function’s script disables various OS’ security and logging features: Clears the firewall rules from iptables Clears the bash history Disables SELinux, watchdog, AppArmor, and firewall service Uninstalls aegis (Alibaba’s cloud security agent), aliyun (Alibaba’s Cloud Monitor Service), and qcloud (Tencent Cloud's qcloud agents) services.The clean_cron function’s script makes the cron files mutable and removes all the existing cron jobs from /etc/crontab, /var/spool/cron, /etc/cron.d, and /var/spool/cron/crontabs to disrupt the existing malware functionalities, as well as the legitimate system functionalities.The lock_cron function’s script makes the files immutable again by changing the attributes of the cron files, reversing the previous action so no one else can change those.The exec_hide function’s script checks that the rootkit is installed first or not. If not present, then it calls another function hide_f() to install the rootkit. In the function hide_f(), it decodes the Base64 encoded .tar file and compiles it under the directory /usr/share/..hide, and installs it as a kernel module with the help of the insmod command.This is the other method the cybercriminals used to hide the processes via modifying the libc. This method uses an old technique to hide the specific process read in the /proc directory. The malicious code is encoded in Base64, the script decodes and compiles it as shared object file, and updates the /etc/ld.so.preload file.The clmo function’s script checks whether the current system is an instance in Alibaba cloud or not, disables the AliSecGuard, and stops aliyun and aegis services.This is the function responsible for lateral movement via SSH and deploys the b.sh file in the remote SSH server. This b.sh file is the same as this cronb.sh file. In the same system, it downloads the s.sh script and executes it. This script is responsible for: nstalling ZGrab, an application layer scanner, to scan the Docker services. Installing pnscan, a port scanner, to scan a whole subnet for a Redis server. Installing masscan, another port scanner, to scan for a Redis server. Installing various utilities from the OS package repositories like iptables, unhide, gcc, redis-tools, and Redis server, among others. Downloading the other supporting shell scripts c.sh and d.sh, and installs them as a service. There have also been observations on these tools as being a part of TeamTNT’s arsenal in previous attacks.As mentioned, s.sh installs various tools needed to infect and move around. The c.sh and d.sh scripts make use of those tools. The c.sh script allows the threat actor to perform these actions: Create a firewall rule in iptables for the Redis-server communication .Utilizes all the scanning tools downloaded by the previous script (s.sh). Adds the following cron job instruction into a .dat file:The d.sh script has the least number of instructions among all the shell scripts used in this routine. This script uses the ZGrab scanner to scan for the available Docker API servers on both TCP ports 2375 (for unencrypted communication with the daemon) and 2376 (for encrypted communication with the daemon) in the network. It then deploys the Alpine Docker image via docker API.The Trend Micro Vision One Workbench App helps analysts see the significant correlated events that are intelligently based on the occurrences that happened throughout the entire fleet of workloads. The left side of the diagram shows the summarized sequence of events happening one after another. Analysts can view the different fields of interest that are considered important and provide security value on the connections seen on the right. The app allows security teams to see the compromised assets and isolate those that can be potentially affected while patching procedures are ongoing.The threat actor goes through a series of actions for deploying the cryptocurrency miner. The routine abuses the Docker infrastructure to infect, download, and run various shell scripts using tools like ZGrab, massscan, pnscan, and Redis to spread in a worm-like fashion to install an XMRig. This attack uses tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) consistent with those of TeamTNT’s, such as the banner and the use of the identified utilities. However, TeamTNT’s behavior is well-known by now, and this does not conclusively identify the group as the threat actor responsible for this sample. Currently, one of the domains used, oracle[.]zzhreceive[.]top, is linked with the cryptocurrency mining group WatchDog, which has been documented utilizing the same domain as TeamTNT. Researchers have also previously observed that “s3f815” and “b2f628” have been used in the directory name convention found in URLs, and the “1.0.4.tar.gz” label used in the file names used by this group. Moreover, since TeamTNT already announced that it was quitting, all these details show that either WatchDog is behind this campaign and likely using the name of TeamTNT, or someone else is mimicking the cybercriminal group. While we do not discount the possibility that TeamTNT can return and using the same routines as well, we will continue to monitor these threats and post updates accordingly.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "TA551 was the most prevalent threat Red Canary encountered in 2020 by a wide margin. Its pervasiveness was revealed not only in the volume of detections, but in the number of organizations affected across multiple industries and company sizes. The preeminence of TA551 is due in part to our depth of detection coverage for it: throughout 2020, 55 distinct detection analytics triggered on activity that we’ve associated with TA551. TA551 also took the top spot due to our ability to detect it in the earliest stages of initial access through patterns in malicious attachments. Approximately two-thirds of TA551 detections we observed didn’t progress beyond opening the malicious attachment. To understand how an organization can be part of the two-thirds that didn’t get infected with the next stage of malware, let’s take a look at the progression of a TA551 attack.TA551 gains initial access via macro-laden Microsoft Word documents delivered within a password-protected ZIP archive attached to a phishing email. Wrapping malicious attachments within password-protected archives enables these messages to bypass many mail protection filters by preventing direct analysis of the malicious files. This technique has become more common in recent years, as it increases the likelihood that the phishing message will make it to a user’s inbox. While TA551 varies the filenames for these ZIP archives, including targeted names tailored to the recipient’s organization, in many cases the name was either request.zip or info.zip.After opening the archive using a password provided within the email body, the recipient is presented with a Word document containing malicious macros. This is the dropper, designed to download additional malware from an adversary-controlled site. This is a crucial point for organizations with a defense-in-depth strategy; many of our TA551 detections progressed no further than the opening of this malicious document. Why? Because organizations that have implemented a restrictive macro policy disrupt this attack by preventing the execution of malicious code. Such a policy is the primary distinction between the two-thirds of detections that stopped here and the one-third that progressed to the more impactful stages of the attack.For a variety of reasons, many organizations and users do allow macros to run. In these cases, the macro will result in a network connection to attempt to download the next stage of the malware. Herein lies another example of a defense-in-depth strategy that may disrupt the attack: a web proxy that inspects network traffic may block access to the domain hosting the malicious payload. In some cases, we observed a network connection and creation of an empty file as a result of the attempted download, but because the malicious content was prevented from being downloaded, the attack chain ended there.If a macro policy doesn’t prevent the code from running and a web proxy doesn’t prevent the next payload from being downloaded, a new malware family will likely execute. TA551 typically transitions from the initial access phase to malware execution via a DLL installer. There have been several variations in how the DLL installer payload was downloaded (see T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer). In some cases, Microsoft Word downloaded the file directly. Other cases leveraged renamed system utilities certutil.exe or mshta.exe to further distance the payload from the dropper. The downloaded DLL file typically masqueraded as well, using a variety of different non-DLL extensions to attempt to blend in—we’ve seen .dat, .jpg, .pdf, .txt, and even .theme file extensions. Despite these attempts to masquerade (and sometimes because of them), our detection analytics repeatedly triggered when the payload was executed. For most of 2020, this execution was done via regsvr32.exe; however, near the end of the year this was replaced with the use of rundll32.exe. While far from the only threat to use these T1218: Signed Binary Proxy Execution sub-techniques, it is no coincidence that T1218 was the second-most prevalent technique we observed in 2020.Once the DLL installer runs, the next stage of malware begins. TA551 has delivered various payloads over the years: In 2019 and early 2020, Ursnif and Zloader were common payloads In mid-2020, TA551 favored delivering Valak as a first-stage and IcedId as a second-stage payload for a few months By mid-July 2020, TA551 stopped using Valak and exclusively delivered IcedID (our fourth most prevalent threat) as its first-stage payload through the end of the year In January 2021, after a brief holiday hiatus, TA551 campaigns returned with a new notable payload: Qbot (our third most prevalent threat) Our understanding of this threat is still evolving, as is the relationship between TA551’s initial access and the post-exploitation goals of the later-stage malware.

        "explain": "The TA505, a Russian-speaking APT group, created a buzz early last year with a devastating ransomware attack on the Maastricht University (UM) in the Netherlands. After considering all possibilities, the University’s management had ended up paying a 30 Bitcoin (equivalent to $220,000 at the time) as ransom to threat actors. However, since then, the group had become submissive as no other major attacks were linked to them. This seems to have changed though in the past couple of weeks as researchers of cybersecurity firm, CYFIRMA, have unearthed a global ransomware campaign of the TA505 APT group dubbed as “Night Blood.”CYFIRMA’s researchers first observed activity from TA505 on May 22, 2021. The operators of the APT group posted 96 IP addresses on an underground discord forum, which in the preceding days was published on three other dark web forums with additional IP addresses. It is suspected that these IP addresses might act as an entry point for the cybercriminals into the victim networks. As per the conversations recorded on these forums, this gang which offers Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and works collectively with its affiliates, has adopted a two-fanged approach depending on the target’s background for extorting a ransom: Gain entry to a publicly accessible web server and then in the case of a simple unsuspecting website visitor, force them to download a malicious plug-in and install the ransomware tool kit. Gain entry to a publicly accessible web server and then in the case of a larger organization or company, install malware to scan all systems connected on the network using identified weakness and then install the ransomware tool kit. Apart from this, they have also adopted the double extortion technique, which involves stealing sensitive data of their victims before encrypting their files and folders and leaving a traditional ransomware note on the infected system. This strategy renders leveraging power to the threat actors during negotiation. As per the initial analysis, the signatures of this campaign match another notorious ransomware group – the REvil gang.CYFIRMA’s researchers have deemed this as a global ransomware campaign because TA505 is said to be actively targeting countries like Japan, Australia, South Korea, the U.K., the U.S., India, Thailand, Singapore, Germany, and Spain. The industries associated with their targets are widespread and includes manufacturing, food and beverages, financial, real estate, insurance, trading platforms, retail and online stores, electronics and telecommunication, government, etc. Although the primary motive of this campaign from the TA505 APT group appears to be financial gain, researchers warn that owing to the doping ban on Russian athletes for the next two Olympics, the group can target organizations and institutions associated with these games in any manner. Researchers also suggest that TA505’s “Night Blood” campaign seems to be in the potential reconnaissance phase and organizations around the globe need to keep a close eye on any suspicious activity.\n\n\n",

This time, however, attackers opportunistically used spear-phishing emails with a Microsoft Word attachment exploiting the recently patched CVE-2017-0199 to deploy the ZeroT Trojan, which in turn downloaded the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Proofpoint is tracking this attacker, believed to operate out of China, as TA459. The actor typically targets Central Asian countries, Russia, Belarus, Mongolia, and others. TA549 possesses a diverse malware arsenal including PlugX, NetTraveler, and ZeroT. [1][2][3] In this blog, we also document other 2017 activity so far by this attack group, including their distribution of ZeroT malware and secondary payloads PCrat/Gh0st.In this campaign, attackers used a Microsoft Word document called 0721.doc, which exploits CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability was disclosed and patched days prior to this attack.The document uses the logic flaw to first download the file power.rtf from hxxp://122.9.52[.]215/news/power.rtf. The payload is actually an HTML Application (HTA) file, not an RTF document.As shown in the figure above, the HTA’s VBScript changes the window size and location and then uses PowerShell to download yet another script: power.ps1. This is a PowerShell script that downloads and runs the ZeroT payload cgi.exe.The attack group has made incremental changes to ZeroT since our last analysis. While they still use RAR SFX format for the initial payloads, ZeroT now uses a the legitimate McAfee utility (SHA256 3124fcb79da0bdf9d0d1995e37b06f7929d83c1c4b60e38c104743be71170efe) named mcut.exe instead of the Norman Safeground AS for sideloading as they have in the past. The encrypted ZeroT payload, named Mctl.mui, is decoded in memory revealing a similarly tampered PE header and only slightly modified code when compared to ZeroT payloads we analyzed previously. Once ZeroT is running, we observed that the fake User-Agent used in the requests changed from “Mozilla/6.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; Tzcdrnt/6.0)” to “Mozilla/6.0 (compatible; MSIE 11.0; Windows NT 6.2)”, thus removing the “Tzcdrnt” typo observed in previous versions. The initial beacon to index.php changed to index.txt but ZeroT still expects an RC4-encrypted response using a static key: “(*^GF(9042&*”.Next, ZeroT uses HTTP beacons to transmit information about the infected system to the command and control (C&C). All posts are encrypted, unlike the last time we analyzed a sample from this actor, when the first POST was accidentally not encrypted. After that, stage 2 payloads are still retrieved as Bitmap (BMP) images that use Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography to hide the real payloads. These images appear normal in image viewers. The stage 2 payload was PlugX that beaconed to C&C servers www[.]icefirebest[.]com and www[.]icekkk[.]net.Throughout 2017 we observed this threat actor actively attempting to compromise victims with various malware payloads. ZeroT remained the primary stage 1 payload, but the stage 2 payloads varied. One such interesting example was “ПЛАН РЕАЛИЗАЦИИ ПРОЕКТА.rar” (SHA256 b5c208e4fb8ba255883f771d384ca85566c7be8adcf5c87114a62efb53b73fda). Translated from Russian, this file is named “PROJECT REALIZATION PLAN” and contains a compressed .scr executable. This ZeroT executable communicated with the C&C domain www[.]kz-info[.]net and downloaded PlugX as well as an additional PCRat/Gh0st Trojan which communicated with the www[.]ruvim[.]net C&C server. PCRat/Gh0st is a payload that we do not see this group using frequently. Another interesting ZeroT sample (SHA256 bc2246813d7267608e1a80a04dac32da9115a15b1550b0c4842b9d6e2e7de374) contained the executable 0228.exe and a decoy document 0228.doc in the RAR SFX archive. Bundling decoy documents is a common tactic by this group. RAR SFX directives are used to display the decoy while the malicious payload is executed. We suspect that this specific lure was copied from the news article hxxp://www.cis.minsk[.]by/news.php?id=7557. This article was about “73-го заседания Экономического совета СНГ”, translated from Russian as “73rd meeting of the CIS Economic Council”, which describes a meeting held in Moscow by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, an organization that includes nine out of the fifteen former Soviet Republics.TA459 is well-known for targeting organizations in Russia and neighboring countries. However, their strategy, tactics, techniques, and procedures in this particular attack emphasize the importance of rigorous patching regimens for all organizations. Even as software vulnerabilities often take a back seat to human exploits and social engineering, robust defenses must include protection at the email gateway, proactive patch management, and thoughtful end user education. Paying attention to the details of past attacks is also an important means of preparing for future attacks. Noting who is targeted, with what malware, and with what types of lures provide clues with which organizations can improve their security posture. At the same time, multinational organizations like the financial services firms targeted here must be acutely aware of the threats from state-sponsored actors working with sophisticated malware to compromise users and networks. Ongoing activity from attack groups like TA459 who consistently target individuals specializing in particular areas of research and expertise further complicate an already difficult security situation for organizations dealing with more traditional malware threats, phishing campaigns, and socially engineered threats every day.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Since 2017, the attacker has flung simple off-the-shelf malware in malicious email campaigns aimed at aviation, aerospace, transportation and defense. Researchers have identified an advanced persistent threat (APT) group responsible for a series of cyberespionage and spyware attacks against the aviation, aerospace, transportation and defense industries since at least 2017 that feature high-volume email campaigns using industry-specific lures. The group, which researchers have dubbed TA2541, typically sends hundreds of thousands of malicious messages – nearly always in English – that ultimately deliver a remote-access trojan (RAT) payload using commodity malware to collect data from victims’ machines and networks, according to a new report by Proofpoint released Tuesday. These campaigns have affected hundreds of organizations across the world, with recurring targets in North America, Europe and the Middle East, researchers said. Though a number of the group’s attacks already have been tracked by various researchers – including Microsoft, Mandiant, Cisco Talos, Morphisec and others – since at least 2019, Proofpoint’s latest research shares “comprehensive details linking public and private data under one threat activity cluster we call TA2541,” researchers wrote.Indeed, previously reported attacks related to TA2541 include a two-year spyware campaign against the aviation industry using the AsyncRAT called Operation Layover and uncovered by Cisco Talos last September, and a cyberespionage campaign against aviation targets spreading RevengeRAT or AsyncRAT revealed by Microsoft last May, among others.Proofpoint first started tracking the actor in 2017 when its tactic of choice was to send messages with “macro-laden Microsoft Word attachments” that downloaded RAT payloads. The group has since tweaked this tactic and now most frequently sends messages with links to cloud services such as Google Drive or OneDrive hosting the payload, according to the report. However, although the approach to how they hide their malicious payload has varied, the group has mostly remained consistent in its choice of targets, lures and the type of payloads it uses, observed Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of Threat Research & Detection at Proofpoint. “What’s noteworthy about TA2541 is how little they’ve changed their approach to cybercrime over the past five years, repeatedly using the same themes, often related to aviation, aerospace, and transportation, to distribute remote access trojans,” she said in an email to Threatpost. “This group is a persistent threat to targets throughout the transportation, logistics, and travel industries.” In terms of which specific RATs are used, attackers tap a variety of low-hanging fruit – that is, commodity malware that’s available for purchase on criminal forums or available in open-source repositories. Currently, TA2541 prefers to drop AsyncRAT on victims’ machines but also is known to use NetWire, WSH RAT and Parallax, researchers said. So far, all of the malware distributed by the group has been aimed at information-gathering purposes and to gain remote control of an infected machine, with researchers acknowledging that they don’t know the threat actor’s “ultimate goals and objectives” beyond this initial compromise, they said.A typical malicious message in a TA2541 campaign uses a lure related to some type of logistical or transportation theme related to one of the particular industries it’s targeting, researchers said. “In nearly all observed campaigns, TA2541 uses lure themes that include transportation-related terms such as flight, aircraft, fuel, yacht, charter, etc.,” according to the report. For example, researchers revealed an email that impersonated an aviation company requesting information on aircraft parts, as well as another that requested info on how to transport a medical patient on a stretcher on an ambulatory flight. Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, the group shifted bait tactics slightly and – like many other threat actors – adopted COVID-related lures consistent with their overall theme of cargo and flight details, researchers noted. “For example, they distributed lures associated with cargo shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) or COVID-19 testing kits,” researchers noted. However, this shift was short-lived, and TA2541 rather quickly returned to its more generic, transportation-related email themes, they added.Join Threatpost on Wed.

According to a security blog post by Symantec, Suckfly stole the certificates from legitimate businesses in Seoul, Korea and used them to hide attacks against worldwide government and commercial entities beginning in early 2014. Symantec became aware of this plot in 2015 after discovering a hacking tool used against one of its clients was signed with a certificate. Suckfly's cyber arsenal includes keyloggers, credential dumpers, port scanners and back doors, including one custom back door named Nidiran specifically developed for cyberespionage campaigns.

Suckfly designed their malware to be difficult to analyze, but researchers managed to analyze the communication between Nidiran and the command and control (C&C) server. Symantec researchers this week detailed what they say is a China-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been launching numerous attacks against high-profile entities since April 2014. “Suckfly has the resources to develop malware, purchase infrastructure, and conduct targeted attacks for years while staying off the radar of security organizations.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A previously unknown group called Strider has been conducting cyberespionage-style attacks against selected targets in Russia, China, Sweden, and Belgium. The group uses an advanced piece of malware known as Remsec (Backdoor.Remsec) to conduct its attacks. Remsec is a stealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings. Strider’s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group, Flamer. The use of Lua modules, which we’ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by Flamer. One of Strider’s targets had also previously been infected by Regin.Strider has been active since at least October 2011. The group has maintained a low profile until now and its targets have been mainly organizations and individuals that would be of interest to a nation state’s intelligence services. Symantec obtained a sample of the group’s Remsec malware from a customer who submitted it following its detection by our behavioral engine. Remsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected computer, can log keystrokes, and steal files. Strider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has found evidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations. The group’s targets include a number of organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium.The Remsec malware used by Strider has a modular design. Its modules work together as a framework that provides the attackers with complete control over an infected computer, allowing them to move across a network, exfiltrate data, and deploy custom modules as required. Remsec contains a number of stealth features that help it to avoid detection. Several of its components are in the form of executable blobs (Binary Large Objects), which are more difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect. In addition to this, much of the malware’s functionality is deployed over the network, meaning it resides only in a computer’s memory and is never stored on disk. This also makes the malware more difficult to detect and indicates that the Strider group are technically competent attackers. Remsec modules seen by Symantec to date include: Loader: Named MSAOSSPC.DLL, this module is responsible for loading files from disk and executing them. The files on disk contain the payload in an executable blob format. The loader also logs data. Executable blobs and data are encrypted and decrypted with a repeating key of 0xBAADF00D. The loader maintains persistence by being implemented as a fake Security Support Provider. Lua modules: Several examples of Remsec use modules written in the Lua programming language. Remsec uses a Lua interpreter to run Lua modules which perform various functions. These Lua modules are stored in the same executable blob format as the loader. Lua modules include: Network loader – This loads an executable over the network for execution. It may use RSA/RC6 encryption. Host loader – This is used to decrypt and load at least three other Lua modules into running processes. It references three named modules: ilpsend, updater (neither of which has been discovered to date), and, kblog (likely the Keylogger module detailed below). Keylogger – This logs keystrokes and exfiltrates this data to a server under the attackers’ control. This is the module that contains a string named “Sauron” in its code. Given its capabilities, it is possible the attackers have nicknamed the module after the all-seeing villain in Lord of the Rings.Network listener: A number of examples of Remsec implement different techniques for opening a network connection based on monitoring for specific types of traffic. These include ICMP, PCAP, and RAW network sockets. Basic pipe back door: This is a minimal back door module, controlled over named pipes. It can execute data in the format of the executable blob or a standard executable. Advanced pipe back door: This offers several more commands than the basic version, including sending the executable blob, listing files, and reading/writing/deleting files. HTTP back door: This module includes several URLs for a command and control (C&C) server. Strider is capable of creating custom malware tools and has operated below the radar for at least five years. Based on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its known targets, it is possible that the group is a nation-state level attacker. Symantec will continue to search for more Remsec modules and targets in order to build upon our understanding of Strider and better protect our customers.Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Remsec.We have also compiled an indicators-of-compromise document containing further details which can be used to help identify the threats if they are present in your environment.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Turla is one of the longest-known state-sponsored cyberespionage groups, with well-known victims such as the US Department of Defense in 2008. The group owns a large toolset [1] [2] that is generally divided into several categories: the most advanced malware is only deployed on machines that are the most interesting to the attackers. Their espionage platform is mainly used against Windows machines, but also against macOS and Linux machines with various backdoors and a rootkit. For years, Turla has relied, among other impersonations, on fake Flash installers to compromise victims. This kind of attack vector does not require highly sophisticated exploits but rather depends on tricking the user into installing the fake program. In recent months, we have observed a strange, new behavior, leading to compromise by one of Turla’s backdoors. Not only is it packaged with the real Flash installer, but it also appears to be downloaded from adobe.com. From the endpoint’s perspective, the remote IP address belongs to Akamai, the official Content Delivery Network (CDN) used by Adobe to distribute their legitimate Flash installer. After digging a bit more, we realized that the fake Flash installers, including the macOS installer for Turla’s backdoor Snake — whether or not they were downloaded from adobe.com URLs — were performing a GET request to get.adobe.com URLs to exfiltrate some sensitive information about the newly compromised machine. Again, according to our telemetry, the IP address was a legitimate IP address used by Adobe. In this whitepaper, we will explain the different possibilities that could lead to such malicious behavior. To our knowledge, this malware did not utilize any legitimate Flash Player updates nor is it associated with any known Adobe product vulnerabilities. We can state with confidence that Adobe was not compromised. These attackers merely use the Adobe brand to trick users into downloading the malware. We also found that the Turla group relied on a web app hosted on Google Apps Script as a Command and Control (C&C) server for JavaScript-based malware dropped by some versions of the fake Flash installer. Thus, it is clear they are trying to be as stealthy as possible by hiding in the network traffic of the targeted organizations. By looking at our telemetry, we found evidence that Turla installers were exfiltrating information to get.adobe.com URLs since at least July 2016. The victims are located in territories of the former USSR. As for Gazer, another malware family developed and distributed by the Turla group and previously described by ESET [2], the targets are mainly consulates and embassies from different countries in Eastern Europe or the vicinity. We have also seen a few private companies infected but they do not seem to be Turla’s main targets. Thus, it seems this campaign is directed against high-value political organizations. Finally, some of the victims are also infected with other Turla-related malware such as ComRAT or Gazer. Before analyzing the weird connections happening over the network, we will explain why we suspect this campaign is the work of the Turla group. Firstly, some fake Flash installers in this campaign drop a backdoor known as Mosquito, which some security companies already detect as Turla malware. Secondly, some of the C&C servers linked to the dropped backdoors are using, or used, SATCOM IP addresses previously associated with Turla [3]. Thirdly, this malware shares similarities with other malware families used by the Turla group. These similarities include the same string obfuscation (string stacking and XOR with 0x55) and the same API resolution. These elements allow us to say with confidence that Turla’s operators drove this campaign. It is not a new tactic for Turla to rely on fake Flash installers to try to trick the user to install one of their backdoors. For instance, Kaspersky Lab documented this behavior in 2014 [4]. However, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that the malicious program is downloaded over HTTP from legitimate Adobe URLs and IP addresses. Thereby, even the most experienced users could be deceived. 3.1 Apparent distribution through adobe.com Since the beginning of August 2016, we have identified a few attempts to download a Turla installer from admdownload.adobe.com URLs. At first glance, we imagined it was the typical trick that consists of setting the host field of the HTTP request while the TCP socket is established to the real IP of the C&C server. However, after deeper analysis, we realized that the IP address legitimately belongs to Akamai, a large CDN provider that Adobe uses to distribute its legitimate Flash installer. Even if the executable is downloaded from a legitimate URL (e.g.: http://admdownload.adobe.com/ bin/live/flashplayer27_xa_install.exe), the referer field appears to have been tampered with. We have seen this referer field set to http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/download/ ?installer=Flash_Player, which is not a URL pattern used by Adobe and hence returns a 404 status code if requested. It is important to note that all the download attempts we identified in our telemetry were made through HTTP, not HTTPS. This allows a wide range of attacks in the path from the user’s machine to Akamai’s servers. The next section is a review of various possible scenarios that could explain this. Exactly what happened is still an open question and we would appreciate any feedback if you have more information. 3.2 Compromise hypotheses Figure 1 shows the different hypotheses that could explain how a user apparently visiting the legitimate Adobe website over HTTP might be forced to download Turla-related malware.We quickly discarded the hypothesis of a rogue DNS server, since the IP address corresponds to the servers used by Adobe to distribute Flash. After discussions with Adobe and from their investigations, scenario ➎ seems unlikely as the attackers did not compromise the Adobe Flash Player download website. Thus, these are the hypotheses that remain: ➊ a Man-in-the Middle (MitM) attack from an already-compromised machine in the local network, ➋ a compromised gateway or proxy of the organization, a MitM attack at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level or a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to redirect the traffic to Turla-controlled servers. Local MitM Turla operators could use an already-compromised machine in the network of the victim’s organization to perform a local MitM attack. Using ARP spoofing, they could modify the traffic on the fly by redirecting the traffic of the targeted machine to a compromised machine. Even though we are not aware of the presence of such tools in the Turla arsenal, such a tool is not hard to develop, especially given the technical abilities of this group. However, we identified many different victims in many different organizations. That means the Turla group would have had to have compromised at least one other computer in each of those organizations, and specifically, a computer on the same subnet as a more preferred target. Compromised gateway This attack is similar to the previous one but much more interesting for the attackers: they can intercept the traffic for the whole organization, without the need to do ARP spoofing, as gateways and proxies typically see all the incoming and outgoing traffic between the organization’s intranet and the internet. We are not aware of the existence of a Turla tool designed to do this —but their rootkit, called Uroburos, has packet analysis abilities. It can be installed on servers and used as a proxy to distribute tasks to infected machines that do not have a public IP address [5]. For a group with the apparent expertise and resources Turla has available, this Uroburos code could easily be modified to intercept traffic on the fly and inject malicious payloads or otherwise modify unencrypted content. If the traffic is not intercepted before exiting an organization’s internal network, it means it is modified later on the path to the Adobe servers. The ISPs are the main point of access on this path, and ESET has previously reported on other actors, such as FinFisher, using packet injection at the ISP level to distribute malware in repackaged installers [6]. All the victims we identified are located in different, former USSR countries and we identified them using at least four different ISPs, based in these different countries. Thus, this scenario would suggest that Turla operators would have to be able to monitor traffic in several different separate countries or links where this data transit. If the traffic is not modified by the ISP and does not reach the Adobe servers, this means it has been re-routed to another server that is controlled by the Turla operators. This can be done by conducting a BGP hijacking attack. There are several methods that can be employed. On one hand, Turla operators could use an Autonomous System (AS) they control to announce a prefix belonging to adobe.com. Thus, the traffic routing to adobe.com from locations near the Turla-controlled AS will be misdirected to their server. An example of such malicious activity was analyzed by RIPE [7]. However, this would be quickly noticed by Adobe or by services performing BGP monitoring. Moreover, we checked on RIPEstat and did not notice any suspicious route announcements for the Adobe IP addresses used in this campaign. On the other hand, the Turla operators could use their AS to announce they have a shorter route than any other AS might have to the Adobe servers. Thus, the traffic would also go through their routers and could be intercepted and modified in real time. However, a big part of the traffic to Adobe would be redirected to the rogue router, so it would be a noisy tactic and the chances are it would have been noticed at some point since the campaign started, in August 2016 or earlier. Of the five scenarios presented in Figure 1, we considered only four, as we are confident Adobe was not compromised. The BGP hijacking and the MitM attack at the ISP level are far more complex than the others. Thus, we believe it is more probable the Turla group has a custom tool installed on local gateways of the impacted organizations, allowing them to intercept and modify the traffic even before it exits the intranet. Once the user has downloaded and launched the fake Flash installer, the compromise process starts. It begins by dropping a Turla backdoor on the machine. This could be Mosquito, a Win32 malware described in section 4, a malicious JavaScript file communicating with a web app hosted on Google Apps Script as described in section 5, or an unknown file downloaded from a fake Adobe URL: http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/download/update/[x32|x64] For the last case, as this URL does not exist on Adobe’s server; for the Turla group to be able to send content through this URL, something must be man-in-the-middling traffic on the path between the compromised machines and the Adobe servers to provide a response to these requests. Then, a request is performed exfiltrating information about the newly-compromised machine. This is a GET request to http://get.adobe.com/stats/AbfFcBebD/q= with, according to our telemetry, a legitimate Adobe IP address but with a URL pattern that is not used by Adobe and thus returns. As the request is performed through HTTP, the same MitM scenarios as discussed in section 3.2 are likely. The base64-encoded data contain interesting and sensitive information about the victim machine, so it would be surprising that it would actually be sent to an Adobe server. Figure 3 is an example of a decoded report. It sends various information such as a unique id (the last 8 bytes of the fake Flash installer executable, as shown in Figure 4), the username, the list of security products installed and the ARP table. Interestingly, the installer of Snake for macOS [8], a backdoor associated with Turla, also uses the exact same URL, as shown in Figure 5. The data sent are a bit different as they only contain the username and device name, although still encoded in base64. However, this behavior was not documented by Fox-IT when they published their analysis. Finally, the fake installer drops or downloads, then runs a legitimate Flash Player application. The legitimate installer is either embedded in the fake installer or downloaded from the following Google Drive URL: https://drive.google[.]com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B_LlMiKUOIstM0R RekVEbnFfaXc&export=download. In this section, we describe the samples we found in the wild, mainly in 2017. We found evidence that this campaign has been running for some years, and the 2017 samples are an evolution from a backdoor in a file conventionally named InstructionerDLL.dll. However, these older samples were less obfuscated and there was only the backdoor DLL, without the loader found in more recent samples. Some of these older samples have compilation timestamps that date back to 2009 but these are likely to have borged. The installer generally comes as a fake Flash installer and is bundled with two additional components later dropped on the disk. As explained above, we identified several users who downloaded this fake Flash installer from a URL and IP used by Adobe for the distribution of the legitimate Flash installer. We detailed the different hypotheses that could explain this behavior in the previous section. Firstly, the crypter makes heavy use of opaque predicates along with arithmetic operations. For example, the obfuscated function will compute a number from hardcoded values and then check if this number is greater than another hardcoded value. Thus, at each execution the control f low will be the same, but emulation is required to determine which path is correct. Therefore, the code becomes far more complex to analyze for both malware researchers and automated algorithms in security software. This may slow down emulation so much that the object won’t be scanned, due to time constraints – and hence software known or shown to be malicious (if not obfuscated) won’t be detected. Secondly, after the first layer is de-obfuscated, a call to the Win32 API SetupDiGetClassDevs (0,0,0,0xFFFFFFFF) is performed, and the crypter then checks whether the return value equals 0xE000021A. This function is generally used to request information about the devices of the system. However, this specific Flags value (0xFFFFFFFF) is not documented, but according to our tests, the return value is always 0xE000021A on Windows 7 and Windows 10 machines. We believe this API call and the following check are used to bypass sandboxes and emulators that do not implement it correctly. Thirdly, the real code is divided into several chunks that are decrypted, using a custom function, and re-ordered at run time to build a PE in memory. It is then executed in-place by the crypter’s PE loader function. This PE loader contains several debug strings as shown in Figure 7.Once decrypted, the installer searches the %APPDATA% subtree and drops two files in the deepest folder it finds. When searching for this folder, it avoids any folder that contains AVAST in its name. It then uses the filename of one of the non-hidden files in this folder, truncated at the extension, as the base filename for the files it will drop. If all the files in the directory are hidden, or the directory is empty, it takes the name of a DLL from %WINDIR%\\System32. The loader it drops will have a .tlb extension and the main backdoor a .pdb extension. Interestingly, it does not use WriteFile to drop these two DLLs. Instead, it creates a file, maps it in memory and calls memmove to copy data. It is probably designed to avoid some sandboxes and security products hooks on WriteFile. We have also seen older variants of the installer dropping only one file, with the .tlb extension. In that case, the same file contains both loader and backdoor functions. DllMain chooses which code to execute. It writes a simple and unencrypted log file in %APPDATA%\\kb6867.bin. The full log file is created in the same directory as the two DLLs and has the .tnl extension. Then, it establishes persistence by using either a Run registry key or COM hijacking [9]. If the antivirus display name, retrieved using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), is “Total Security”, it adds rundll32.exe [backdoor_path], StartRoutine in HKCU\\Software\\Run\\auto_update. Otherwise, it will replace the registry entry under HKCR\\CLSID\\{D9144DCD-E998-4ECA-AB 6A-DCD83CCBA16D}\\InprocServer32 or HKCR\\CLSID\\{08244EE6-92F0-47F2-9FC9-929BA A2E7235}\\InprocServer32 with the path to the loader. These CLSIDs correspond respectively to EhStorShell.dll and to ntshrui.dll. These DLLs are launched legitimately by a lot of processes, including explorer.exe, the main windows GUI. Thus, the loader will be called each time explorer.exe is started. Finally, it adds an entry in the registry to store the path to the original hijacked DLL and to the main backdoor, as shown in Figure 9. Other CLSIDs are hardcoded in the binary but we have not seen any use made of them. The full list is available in the IoCs section. As explained in the previous section, the installer sends some information — such as the unique id of the sample, the username or the ARP table — to a URL at an Adobe domain, get.adobe.com. It will also launch a real Adobe Flash installer, which is either downloaded from Google Drive or embedded in the fake installer. Before launching the main backdoor, the installer creates an administrative account HelpAssistant (or HelpAsistant in some samples) with the password sysQ!123. Also, the LocalAccountToken FilterPolicy is set to 1, allowing remote administrative actions. We believe this account name was used to remain stealthy as this is the name used when a legitimate Remote Assistance session is run [10]. The launcher, named DebugParser.dll internally, is called when the hijacked COM object is loaded. It is responsible for launching the main backdoor and for loading the hijacked COM object. The simplified pseudo-code of this component is provided in Figure 10.Because the original DLL is loaded, the user is unlikely to notice that the backdoor was launched at the same time. In the case of older variants, with the loader and backdoor functions in one file, the DllMain chooses which code to execute, as shown in Figure 13. The main backdoor of this campaign, called CommanderDLL by its authors, is launched either by the loader described above, or directly at startup if the chosen persistence mechanism is the Run registry entry. In both cases, this library’s StartRoutine export is called while, as shown in Figure 14, this export is not present in the DLL’s export table. Firstly, the CommanderDLL module deletes the dropper (the fake Flash installer) file. The path is received from the dropper via a named pipe called \\.\\pipe\\namedpipe. Then, in a new thread, it creates a second named pipe, \\.\\pipe\\ms32loc, and waits until another process connects to this pipe, at which point the program exits. Secondly, it sets up some internal structures and stores configuration values in the registry. Table 1 describes the different registry values stored under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\[dllname]. All the registry values, except the layout entry, are encrypted using a custom algorithm that is described in the next section. Third, an additional C&C server address is downloaded from a document hosted on Google Docs (https://docs.google[.]com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B_wY-Tu90pbjTDllRENWNkNma0k&export=download). It is also encrypted using the same algorithm described below. This backdoor relies on a custom encryption algorithm. Each byte of the plaintext is XORed with a stream generated by a function that looks similar to the Blum Blum Shub algorithm [11]. To encrypt or decrypt, a key and a modulus are passed to the encryption function. Different keys and moduli are used in the different samples. Some are hardcoded while others are generated during execution. Table 2 describes the different keys and moduli used by this malware. The program maintains a comprehensive log file under the name [dllname].tnl. Interestingly, it includes the timestamp of each log entry, allowing an easy retrace of the chain of events that happened on a compromised machine. This could be very helpful for forensic investigators. It is encrypted using the previously-described algorithm. The key is located at offset 0x20 in the header of the log file and the modulus is always 0x5DEE0B89. Figure 18 describes the structure of this file. The backdoor’s main loop is responsible for managing the communication with the C&C server and executing the commands it sends. At the beginning of each round, it sleeps a random amount of time – usually around 12 minutes. The requests to the C&C server always use the same URL scheme: https://[C&C server domain]/scripts/m/query.php?id=[base64(encrypted data)]. The user-agent is hardcoded in the samples and cannot be changed: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/ 41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36 This is the default value used by Google Chrome 41. The structure of the id parameter is described in Figure 20. The previous example is the case for which the id GET parameter contains the Data structure. However, data can also be put inside a cookie (with a null name) or in a POST request. Figure 21 describes the various possibilities. In all cases, the encryption key is the first DWORD of the URL id structure. This key, in combination with the modulus 0x7DFDC101, can decrypt the URL id structure, the POST data and the cookie value. Then, the payload of the data structure is decrypted. The initial request contains general information about the compromised machine, such as the result of the commands ipconfig, set, whoami and tasklist. Then, the C&C server replies with one of several batches of instructions. The structure of this reply is described in . The packet is fully encrypted (except the first four bytes), with the same algorithm, derived from Blum Blum Shub, described in section 4.3 using the first DWORD for the key and 0x7DFDC101 for the modulus. Each batch of instructions is encrypted separately using 0x3EB13 for the key and 0x7DFDC101 for the modulus. Some of the fake Flash installers deliver two JavaScript backdoors instead of Mosquito, the Win32 backdoor. These files are dropped on the disk in the folder %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\. They are named google_update_checker.js and local_update_checker.js The first one contacts a web app hosted on Google Apps Script with the following URL (https://script.google[.]com/macros/s/AKfycbwF_VS5wHqlHmi4EQoljEtIsjmglLBO 69n_2n_k2KtBqWXLk3w/exec) and expects a base64-encoded reply. Then, it executes the decoded content using eval. We don’t know what the exact purpose of this additional backdoor is, but it may be used to download additional malware or to execute malicious JavaScript code directly. To establish persistence, it adds a Shell value under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\ The second JavaScript file reads %PROGRAMDATA%\\1.txt and executes its content using the eval function. To establish persistence, it adds a local_update_check value in HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run This campaign shows that Turla’s operators have many ideas to trick the user and to hide their malicious traffic as legitimate. Even an experienced user can be fooled by downloading a malicious file that is apparently from adobe.com, since the URL and the IP address correspond to Adobe’s legitimate infrastructure. However, the usage of HTTPs would significantly reduce the effectiveness of these kinds of attacks, as it is harder to intercept and modify encrypted traffic on the path between a machine and a remote server. Similarly, a check of the file signature should quickly raise suspicion, as the files used in this campaign are not signed whereas installers from Adobe are. It also shows that Turla is still interested in consulates and embassies located in Eastern Europe and they put a lot of effort into keeping their remote access to these important sources of information.

        "explain": "Turla, also known as Snake, is an infamous espionage group recognized for its complex malware. To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk. Turla is believed to have been operating since at least 2008, when it successfully breached the US military. More recently, it was involved in major attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military. This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was based on the open-source project Posh-SecMod. However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes. After a few months, Turla has improved these scripts and is now using them to load a wide range of custom malware from its traditional arsenal. The victims are quite usual for Turla. We identified several diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe that were compromised using these scripts. However, it is likely the same scripts are used more globally against many traditional Turla targets in Western Europe and the Middle East. Thus, this blogpost aims to help defenders counter these PowerShell scripts. We will also present various payloads, including an RPC-based backdoor and a backdoor leveraging OneDrive as its Command and Control (C&C) server.The PowerShell loader has three main steps: persistence, decryption and loading into memory of the embedded executable or library.The PowerShell scripts are not simple droppers; they persist on the system as they regularly load into memory only the embedded executables. We have seen Turla operators use two persistence methods:In the first case, attackers create two WMI event filters and two WMI event consumers. The consumers are simply command lines launching base64-encoded PowerShell commands that load a large PowerShell script stored in the Windows registry. Figure 1 shows how the persistence is established.These events will run respectively at 15:30:40 and when the system uptime is between 300 and 400 seconds. The variable $HL39fjh contains the base64-encoded PowerShell command shown in Figure 2. It reads the Windows Registry key where the encrypted payload is stored, and contains the password and the salt needed to decrypt the payload.Finally, the script stores the encrypted payload in the Windows registry. Note that the attackers seem to use a different registry location per organization. Thus, it is not a useful indicator to detect similar intrusions.The payload stored in the Windows registry is another PowerShell script. It is generated using the open-source script Out-EncryptedScript.ps1 from the Penetration testing framework PowerSploit. In addition, the variable names are randomized to obfuscate the script, as shown in Figure 4.The payload is decrypted using the 3DES algorithm. The Initialization Vector, PINGQXOMQFTZGDZX in this example, is different for each sample. The key and the salt are also different for each script and are not stored in the script, but only in the WMI filter or in the profile.ps1 file. The payload decrypted at the previous step is a PowerShell reflective loader. It is based on the script Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 from the same PowerSploit framework. The executable is hardcoded in the script and is loaded directly into the memory of a randomly chosen process that is already running on the system. In some samples, the attackers specify a list of executables that the binary should not be injected into, as shown in Figure 5.It is interesting to note that the names avp.exe, avpsus.exe, klnagent.exe and vapm.exe refer to Kaspersky Labs executables. It seems that Turla operators really want to avoid injecting their malware into Kaspersky software.In some samples deployed since March 2019, Turla developers modified their PowerShell scripts in order to bypass the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). This is an interface allowing any Windows application to integrate with the installed antimalware product. It is particularly useful for PowerShell and macros. They did not find a new bypass but re-used a technique presented at Black Hat Asia 2018 in the talk The Rise and Fall of AMSI. It consists of the in-memory patching of the beginning of the function AmsiScanBuffer in the library amsi.dll. The PowerShell script loads a .NET executable to retrieve the address of AmsiScanBuffer. Then, it calls VirtualProtect to allow writing at the retrieved address. Finally, the patching is done directly in the PowerShell script as shown in Figure 6. It modifies the beginning of AmsiScanBuffer to always return 1 (AMSI_RESULT_NOT_DETECTED). Thus, the antimalware product will not receive the buffer, which prevents any scanning.The PowerShell scripts we have presented are generic components used to load various payloads, such as an RPC Backdoor and a PowerShell backdoor.Turla has developed a whole set of backdoors relying on the RPC protocol. These backdoors are used to perform lateral movement and take control of other machines in the local network without relying on an external C&C server. The features implemented are quite basic: file upload, file download and command execution via cmd.exe or PowerShell. However, the malware also supports the addition of plugins. This RPC backdoor is split into two components: a server and a client. An operator will use the client component to execute commands on another machine where the server component exists, as summarized in Figure 7.For instance, the sample identified by the following SHA-1 hash EC54EF8D79BF30B63C5249AF7A8A3C652595B923 is a client version. This component opens the named pipe \\pipe\\atctl with the protocol sequence being “ncacn_np” via the RpcStringBindingComposeW function. The sample can then send commands by calling the NdrClientCall2 function. The exported procedure HandlerW , responsible for parsing the arguments, shows that it is also possible to try to impersonate an anonymous token or try to steal another’s process token just for the execution of a command. Its server counterpart does the heavy lifting and implements the different commands. It first checks if the registry key value HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\\NullSessionPipes contains “atctl”. If so, the server sets the security descriptor on the pipe object to “S:(ML;;NW;;;S-1-16-0)” via the SetSecurityInfo function. This will make the pipe available to everyone (untrusted/anonymous integrity level). The following image shows the corresponding MIDL stub descriptor and the similar syntax and interface ID.As mentioned previously, this backdoor also supports loading plugins. The server creates a thread that searches for files matching the following pattern lPH*.dll. If such a file exists, it is loaded and its export function ModuleStart is called. Among the various plugins we have located so far, one is able to steal recent files and files from USB thumb drives. Many variants of this RPC backdoor are used in the wild. Among some of them, we have seen local proxies (using upnprpc as the endpoint and ncalrpc as the protocol sequence) and newer versions embedding PowerShellRunner to run scripts directly without using powershell.exe.The main purpose of this utility is to retrieve the RPC configuration of a process that has registered an interface. In order to find that kind of process, it iterates through the TCP table (via the GetTcpTable2 function) until it either finds the PID of the process that has opened a specific port, or retrieves the PID of the process that has opened a specific named pipe. Once this PID is found, this utility reads the remote process’ memory and tries to retrieve the registered RPC interface. The code for this, seen in Figure 9, seems ripped from this Github repository.At first we were unsure how the retrieved information was used but then another sample, (SHA-1: B948E25D061039D64115CFDE74D2FF4372E83765) helped us understand. As shown in Figure 10, this sample retrieves the RPC interface, unsets the flag to RPC_IF_ALLOW_SECURE_ONLY, and patches the “dispatch table” in memory using the WriteProcessMemory function. Those operations would allow the sample to add its RPC functions to an already existing RPC interface. We believe it is stealthier to re-use an existing RPC interface than to create a custom one.PowerStallion is a lightweight PowerShell backdoor using Microsoft OneDrive, a storage service in the cloud, as C&C server. The credentials are hardcoded at the beginning of the script, as shown in Figure 11.It is interesting to note that Turla operators used the free email provider GMX again, as in the Outlook Backdoor and in LightNeuron. They also used the name of a real employee of the targeted organization in the email address. Then it uses a net use command to connect to the network drive. It then checks, in a loop, as shown in Figure 12, if a command is available. This backdoor can only execute additional PowerShell scripts. It writes the command results in another OneDrive subfolder and encrypts it with the XOR key 0xAA.Another interesting artefact is that the script modifies the modification, access and creation (MAC) times of the local log file to match the times of a legitimate file – desktop.ini in that example, as shown in Figure 13.In a 2018 blogpost, we predicted that Turla would use more and more generic tools. This new research confirms our forecast and shows that the Turla group does not hesitate to use open-source pen-testing frameworks to conduct intrusion. However, it does not prevent attributing such attacks to Turla. Attackers tend to configure or modify those open-source tools to better suit their needs. Thus, it is still possible to separate different clusters of activities. Finally, the usage of open-source tools does not mean Turla has stopped using its custom tools. The payloads delivered by the PowerShell scripts, the RPC backdoor and PowerStallion, are actually very customized. Our recent analysis of Turla LightNeuron is additional proof that this group is still developing complex, custom malware. We will continue monitoring new Turla activities and will publish relevant information on our blog. For any inquiries, contact us as threatintel@eset.com. Indicators of Compromise can also be found on our GitHub.\n\n\n",

Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat through WildFire and Cortex XDR. AutoFocus customers can investigate this activity with the tag “IronNetInjector”.With IronPython, you can use .NET framework APIs directly in your Python script. It is a Python interpreter written entirely in C#. Currently, it fully supports Python 2, while support for Python 3 is still in development. As one of two official projects formerly developed by Microsoft, the other being IronRuby, it uses the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). Now, it becomes clear why IronPython is also attractive for malware authors. You can make use of the .NET framework APIs without having to compile a .NET assembly. Of course, this requires the IronPython interpreter to also be present on the system, but that can be accomplished in different ways. Also, IronPython scripts don’t run with the original Python interpreter when .NET framework APIs are used in the code. In case of a sandbox that supports Python scripts, the interpreter would simply crash without any dynamic analysis result. Further, as IronPython is written in C# and thus its process contains all the Common Language Runtime (CLR) on execution, one can easily load additional assemblies.IronNetInjector is made of an IronPython script that contains a .NET injector and one or more payloads. The payloads can be also .NET assemblies (x86/64) or native PEs (x86/64). When an IronPython script is run, the .NET injector gets loaded, which in turn injects the payload(s) into its own or a remote process. The key features of the malicious IronPython scripts are as follows:We have found two versions of the .NET injector, a newer variant internally named NetInjector compiled in 2019 and an earlier variant named PeInjector_x64 compiled in 2018. The earlier variant is much more limited in functionality compared to the 2019 variant. Both versions are full-blown PE injection tools able to load a native x86/64 payload reflectively into a remote process. This is accomplished via unmanaged functions and the use of PeNet, a publicly available PE parser library written in C#. The decompiled code is self-explanatory as meaningful function, method and variable names are used throughout the code. Additionally, log and error messages are being used extensively. Most of the code of the 2018 variant is taken from PowerShell Empire’s ReflectivePEInjection script and got translated into C#. It’s written in a much more specific manner than the 2019 variant, which is a generically written injection tool. The newer version additionally contains the ability to inject .NET assemblies into unmanaged processes. Also, it can load payloads into its own process space, the IronPython interpreter process. The newer injector has the following PDB path left: C:\\Users\\Devel\\source\\repos\\c4\\agent\\build_tools\\agent_dll_to_Python_loader\\NetInjector\\NetInjector\\obj\\Release\\NetInjector.pdb The same submitters who uploaded the IronPython scripts also submitted other files which are directly related to IronNetInjector. Based on the file sizes and the file sizes of the embedded payloads in the IronPython scripts, we can make some assumptions about what the payloads likely are. The following table shows the IronPython scripts categorized by the different VirusTotal submitters. It also shows which other samples uploaded by the same submitter or the other submitters are connected and gives the assumed embedded malware:It becomes clear that IronNetInjector is mostly used to load ComRAT. In one case, a variant of the RPC backdoor is used and in another a payload that we couldn’t associate with known malware. We also couldn’t verify how the IronPython scripts get run in the first place. One of the submitters uploaded a 7-Zip archive with the contents of the IronPython MSI file of version 2.7.0.40 from 2011. This archive also contains two IronPython scripts (see table) and a Windows task XML file named mssch.xml with the following content:The task is used to start an IronPython script with the 64-bit version of the interpreter. As a command line argument, the Rijndael decryption key is passed. However, the key didn’t decrypt on any of the embedded files in the scripts we found. The task’s description is PythonUpdateSrvc and it runs either on Windows startup when a user logs in or when one of two system events get created:Depending on the system, the event with ID 8001 belongs to Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), Microsoft Exchange Server or Windows Server (Source: Netsurion EventTracker). The other event with ID 5324 is likely related to the logoff from Winlogon. Both triggers only happen when these events appear in the Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy(/Operational) event logs. When we consider that the files in the 7-Zip archive were all taken from the same directory, we can make some assumptions. The attacker might have used the IronPython MSI to install the interpreter to C:\\ProgramData\\IronPython-2.7 on the victim’s system. The IronPython scripts and the Windows task XML were placed in the same directory. The task file is then used to create a task which in turn starts a script when triggered. However, it’s also possible that the submitter collected the files from different places and just bundled them into an archive for scanning purposes. It’s also unclear why the attacker would use such an old version of IronPython.Let’s go briefly through the execution flow based on one of the scripts of VirusTotal submitter 4 that contains the 2019 variant of the injector and a ComRAT variant (SHA256: 3aa37559ef282ee3ee67c4a61ce4786e38d5bbe19bdcbeae0ef504d79be752b6). When an IronPython script is run, it is loaded into the IronPython interpreter. In the IronPython script, the embedded .NET injector (SHA256: a56f69726a237455bac4c9ac7a20398ba1f50d2895e5b0a8ac7f1cdb288c32cc) and ComRAT DLL payload (SHA256: a62e1a866bc248398b6abe48fdb44f482f91d19ccd52d9447cda9bc074617d56) get decoded and decrypted. This is done with the Python Base64 module and the RijndaelManaged class from the C# cryptography namespace. The decryption key is passed as an argument to the IronPython script. The Rijndael initialization vector (IV) is stored in the script. Next, the .NET injector gets loaded into the IronPython process with the help of the Assembly.Load() method of the C# Reflection namespace. That's possible because IronPython itself is a .NET assembly and thus its process already contains all the .NET runtime libraries. After the injector assembly is loaded, the ID of the process where the ComRAT DLL gets injected is retrieved. In this case, the explorer.exe was chosen. This routine to get the PID slightly differs in the IronPython scripts we found. While one script uses the C# method GetProcessesByName() to get the PID, the other scripts run the Windows tool tasklist.exe with the help of the Python os.popen() function. The output is then parsed to the targeted process ID with the help of tasklist filters. Also, some scripts filter the PID based on a Windows service name. When the PID is found, an instance of the injector assembly is created and the ComRAT payload bytes and PID are passed. Finally, the injector's public methods Invoke() and InvokeVoid() get called. In the latter, the exported function name VFEP of the ComRAT payload gets passed. From this point on, the .NET injector takes control over the further execution. The .NET injector contains the following namespaces:While the PeNet code is copied from the project, the namespace DefaultSerializer contains the injector code and is made of the following classes:These methods are used pairwise. The method InjectAssembly is used to inject a .NET assembly into a native process (or its own) and InvokeAssemblyMethod to call any chosen method of the injected assembly. The method Invoke is used to inject a native PE into a remote process and InvokeVoid to call any exported function of the injected payload.Depending on the number of arguments passed to DefaultSerializer on creation time, the payload is either loaded into its own process or a remote one. In case only the payload bytes are passed, it gets loaded into its own process space. The other options are to also pass the ID or handle of the remote process the payload gets injected to. In our case, the second option is used with the PID of explorer.exe to load the ComRAT payload reflectively into the process. One other interesting aspect of the injector is its ability to load an assembly into an unmanaged process. This needs some preparation in the remote process, as you cannot simply load and execute a .NET assembly there if the CLR isn’t present. This is accomplished with a native bootstrapper DLL, which gets injected into the remote process and prepares it so a .NET assembly can be injected afterwards. There are two bootstrappers (x86/64) contained in the NetBootstrapper class, which have the following PDB paths left:These functions are called from the injector to prepare and load a .NET assembly payload from the IronPython script into a remote process. In all the IronPython scripts we found, only the native payload to native remote process injection option is used.IronNetInjector is another toolset in Turla’s ever-growing arsenal, made of an IronPython script and an injector. It’s similar in structure to the previously used in-memory loading mechanism to execute malware with the help of PowerShell scripts. These scripts contain an embedded PE loader to execute an embedded malware payload. The tool we discussed in this blogpost was likely developed to move away from PowerShell towards .NET. This general trend can be seen in recent years as detection of Powershell based threats became better, but also due to security mechanisms like AMSI introduced by Microsoft. The .NET injectors and bootstrappers contain clean code and meaningful function/method/variable names, and they use detailed log/error messages. Only the initial IronPython scripts are obfuscated to prevent easy detection. There are still some questions we need answers for, such as what other samples get loaded beside ComRAT and the RPC backdoor? How do the IronPython scripts get run? And how is the interpreter deployed to a victim’s system? We will continue to monitor for this malware loading tool to get the missing pieces of the puzzle. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this malware tool. Our threat prevention platform WildFire detects it as malicious. Our extended detection and response platform Cortex XDR can identify and block the malware execution. AutoFocus customers can track the activity with the tag “IronNetInjector”.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "A new advanced malware, dubbed AcidBox, was used by an unknown threat actor in 2017 that went undetected until now.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "When the news broke in 2014 about a new sophisticated threat actor dubbed the Turla Group, which the Estonian foreign intelligence service believes has Russian origins and operates on behalf of the FSB, its kernelmode malware also became the first publicly-described case that abused a third-party device driver to disable Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). This security mechanism was introduced in Windows Vista to prevent unsigned drivers from loading into kernel space. Turla exploited the signed VirtualBox driver, VBoxDrv.sys v1.6.2, to deactivate DSE and load its unsigned payload drivers afterward. There is some confusion about this exploit, however, as it’s often generally referred to as CVE-2008-3431. The exploit used by Turla actually abuses two vulnerabilities -- of which, only one was ever fixed in the aforementioned CVE. The other vulnerability was found by Turla and is used in the first version of their exploit, along with CVE-2008-3431. The second version of their exploit, presumably introduced in 2014 of their kernelmode malware, only uses the unpatched vulnerability, which we discuss in greater detail later.In February 2019, Unit 42 found that a yet-to-be-known threat actor -- unbeknownst to the infosec community -- discovered that the second unpatched vulnerability can not only exploit VirtualBox VBoxDrv.sys driver v1.6.2, but also all other versions up to v3.0.0. Furthermore, our research shows that this unknown actor exploited VirtualBox driver version 2.2.0 to target at least two different Russian organizations in 2017, which we are revealing for the first time. We anticipate this was done because the driver version 2.2.0 wasn't known to be vulnerable and thus most likely is not on the radar of security companies being exploited. Since no other victims have been found, we believe this is a very rare malware used in targeted attacks only. The actors used a previously unknown malware family that we have dubbed AcidBox due to the first part being an anagram of the malware’s driver device name and the second part taken from VirtualBox. Because of the malware’s complexity, rarity, and the fact that it’s part of a bigger toolset, we believe it was used by an advanced threat actor for targeted attacks and it's likely that this malware is still being used today if the attacker is still active. However, we anticipate that it was rewritten to a certain extent. Based on the information we have, we don’t believe this unknown threat actor is tied to Turla, except for the used exploit. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat. Our threat prevention platform with WildFire identifies this malware as malicious. AutoFocus customers can track malware activity by using the AcidBox tag. We also created an Adversary Playbook for this attack, which can be found here.In February 2019, we discovered a sample of AcidBox (SHA256: eb30a1822bd6f503f8151cb04bfd315a62fa67dbfe1f573e6fcfd74636ecedd5) uploaded to VirusTotal, which contained a string known to be used in Turla’s VirtualBox exploit. A deeper analysis of the sample revealed it’s the main worker module as part of a sophisticated malware that we couldn’t tie to any known threat actor. In collaborating with our colleagues at Dr.Web, we learned that this sample was used in a targeted attack on an unspecified entity in Russia back in 2017. Thankfully, they shared three additional samples of the same malware family. Two of those usermode samples are modules that load the main worker from the Windows registry and one is the kernelmode payload driver embedded in the main worker sample. Moreover, we contacted Kaspersky since the company is headquartered in Russia, which found only one additional sample in their databases that was also the usermode loader version. We also contacted ESET, which didn’t find any victims infected with this malware, just like in our own case. For this reason, we conclude it’s a very rare malware used in targeted attacks only. What all the samples have in common are the compilation timestamps of May 9, 2017. This date seems legitimate, as the sample found by Kaspersky appeared in June 2017 in their databases. Therefore, we conclude that the campaign which involved this malware took place in 2017. We couldn’t find any newer samples and thus it’s unknown if AcidBox is still in use or has been further developed. We compared the specific characteristics of the samples to all publicly-known malware, but couldn’t find any clear overlaps. There are some very loose similarities to Remsec malware attributed to ProjectSauron, like:However, based on these facts alone, it’s not possible to attribute the samples to the ProjectSauron threat actor. We think it’s more likely this is a yet unknown threat actor.The original vulnerability described in CVE-2008-3431 was found by Core Security in 2008 and affected VBoxDrv.sys less or equal version 1.6.2. It was fixed in version 1.6.4 and thus couldn’t be exploited anymore.The vulnerability is located in the dispatch device control routine called VBoxDrvNtDeviceControl. On versions prior to 1.6.4, you can call the usermode DeviceIoControl API function and send one of the following control codes together with a kernel address you want to overwrite as the input/output buffer:The kernel address is passed down to the control handler (see Figure 1 left, line 28) without any check or validation and is filled with the return value of supdrvIOCtlFast (see Figure 1 left, line 24). This is where the vulnerability digging from CoreSecurity stops and where Turla continues. In the original exploit, the return value from supdrvIOCtlFast isn’t controlled and thus it will be a random value written to your kernel address. Turla’s exploit controls the return value by overwriting the function pointer of supdrvIOCtlFast to redirect execution to a small shellcode, which returns the needed value. This was described in great detail in a couple of articles and the complete reverse-engineered exploit code is also available. The patched version 1.6.4 (see Figure 1 right) doesn’t use the UserBuffer pointer anymore, which could be abused by passing a kernel address. Additionally, it checks if the rc variable is equal or bigger than zero -- which isn’t needed for the patch, but more like a sanity check. With this patch, the original vulnerability to overwrite a kernel address was fixed. The other vulnerability that lets you control the function pointer of supdrvIOCtlFast remained unpatched. Of course, that’s because it wasn’t discovered by Core Security at the time, but only a few years later by the Turla threat actor. While Turla still uses the vulnerable VirtualBox driver v.1.6.2 to date, it only makes use of the unpatched vulnerability. The reason why and how it uses it was described by Lastline, and also the reverse-engineered exploit code is available in a project named Turla Driver Loader. The secret is the exact same exploit, with only a small modification -- which we won’t disclose here -- can be used on all VBoxDrv.sys versions up to 3.0.0. This was also figured out by an unknown threat actor. While VirtualBox versions smaller than 4.0 aren’t available on the official website anymore, they can still be found on some software download sites. Starting from version 3.0.0, some structures and routines have changed so the exploit does not work anymore. However, it can’t be ruled out that in later versions it’s still possible to exploit the same vulnerability with some more adjustments. What’s also interesting is that not even the Turla authors themself seem to have realized that. They still use the old VBoxDrv.sys v.1.6.2 in their otherwise stealthy exploit. This driver is widely known to be used for malicious or various otherwise dubious purposes, for example, in-game cheats.The malware is a complex modular toolkit of which we have only a part of it. In total, we have found four 64-bit usermode DLLs and an unsigned kernelmode driver (SHA256: 3ef071e0327e7014dd374d96bed023e6c434df6f98cce88a1e7335a667f6749d). Three out of the four usermode samples have identical functionality and are loaders for the main worker module. They only differ in their file descriptions and the embedded and encrypted registry path. These loaders are created as security support providers (further SSP). A SSP is a DLL that exports at least the function SpLsaModeInitialize and usually provides security mechanisms such as authentication between client/server applications. There are a couple of standard SSPs provided in Windows such as Kerberos (kerberos.dll) or NTLM (msv1_0.dll). You can abuse the SSP interface for malware persistency and also for injection purposes. In order to maintain persistency, you have to put your SSP DLL into the Windows system directory and add the name of your DLL to a certain registry value. Upon a system restart, your DLL gets loaded into the Windows lsass.exe process and is executed. If you just want your SSP DLL to be injected into lsass.exe, you can call the API function AddSecurityPackage which triggers immediate loading. Of course, you need at least admin privileges for both of these methods. The first case of a malware abusing the SSP interface was mentioned by Matt Graeber in 2014. Since then, this persistence and injection trick has become wider known, but it’s still rarely used in malware. In case of the three AcidBox SSP DLLs, they don’t make use of any security related operations, but purely abuse this interface for injection purposes and most likely also for persistence. The three SSPs have different file names that are similar to the standard packages provided in Windows (msv1_0.dll, pku2u.dll, wdigest.dll):For this reason, we conclude the AcidBox SSPs also abuse the interface for persistence. However, as we don’t have the component which installs the SSP DLLs, we don’t know for sure. What we know is that the SSP interface is used for injection into lsass.exe, as they check at the beginning whether the process path they're loaded into matches the one which is embedded into every sample in the resource section (C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\lsass.exe). This process path is contained in the resource 4097 which we describe later how it is hidden via steganography. The purpose of the AcidBox SSP DLLs is to load the main worker module from a registry value contained in resource 256 of each sample. We don’t know how the main worker DLL was stored in the registry, but we believe it was done by the same missing component which installed the SSP DLLs. We also assume that the three SSP DLLs are from three different systems as one of those samples has a different registry key embedded. Also, as these modules are the only visible part on a system -- with the main worker module being loaded remains encrypted in the registry -- they likely differ in some way like their chosen file name. The main worker is stored in the registry encrypted within a data blob that contains various other metadata such as the CRC32 hash of the data blob or magic byte sequences which indicate different types of contained data. After the main worker DLL gets decrypted by a SSP DLL from the registry via simply XORing the data with key 0xCA, it gets prepared to be loaded from memory. It does so by creating a thread for the module and uses the exported function UpdateContext of the main worker as its start address. The main worker module then loads the unsigned malware driver via the VirtualBox exploit and waits for commands from one or more components that we don’t have. These commands include the loading of additional payloads from the registry from kernel space via the driver or the installation of new SSP DLLs. The main worker has 2 export functions named InitMainStartup and UpdateContext. The following strings are present in cleartext:All the functionality is contained in the two export functions, while DllMain does not contain any relevant code. What stands out is the extensive use of custom DWORD-size status codes throughout the code. Decompiled code example with status codes in result variable:The main worker sample contains five icon resources with valid icons named 16, 256, 4097, 8193 and 12289. The names indicate different icon resolutions, but the icons only differ in the encrypted data appended to them which can be considered as a form of steganography. This data is encrypted with a custom algorithm and additionally zlib compressed. The same method is used within the SSP DLLs. A Python script for decryption and decompression can be found in the Appendix. After decryption, the data blob has the following structure:Resources 16 and 256 are the Windows registry keys that contain the decryption key for the embedded driver in resource 8193 and additional payloads that are likely going to be injected by the AcidBox driver.This resource contains the path of the process each sample uses to verify it is being loaded into the correct process. Resource 8193 contains the unsigned kernelmode payload driver, which is also encrypted with RSA. The driver is realized as a kernelmode DLL with two export functions InitEntry and InitExit. It contains the following cleartext strings:While studying the samples, PE header characteristics -- an often overseen forensic indicator -- caught our attention. This little known fact can be found in the export directory and can be helpful for attributing malware samples. All of the AcidBox samples contain gaps between the single exported function entries:Every AcidBox sample has a NumberOfFunctions value in the export directory that is bigger than the NumberOfNames value. This isn’t something unusual, as not every exported function has to have a name too. Unnamed functions can be also called by their ordinal values. What is uncommon, however, is that the function entries which are unnamed are also zeroed out, thus not used. This is the result when you use your own DEF file instead of __declspec(dllexport) to describe the attributes of your DLL file. When you use a DEF file, you can choose which ordinal your export function will have. This is not possible with __declspec(dllexport) as the Visual Studio compiler always counts your functions starting from one. Using a DEF file instead of __declspec(dllexport) has some advantages. You are able to export functions by ordinals and you can also redirect functions among other things. The disadvantage is that you have to maintain an additional file within your project. In the case of the AcidBox samples, we can conclude a couple of things. First, the author uses a DEF file, although he doesn’t make use of its advantages. This could indicate it’s a habit of the author to use DEF files. Second, the function ordinals seem to be chosen in steps of two integers. A possible explanation could be that the unused ordinals were once used for functions too. And last, if we assume the author really has chosen to make two integer steps, then in the usermode DLLs, one export function was removed. We can see that ordinal 3 is unused, leaving a bigger gap than one integer. All this information can be useful for malware attribution.A new advanced malware, dubbed AcidBox, was used by an unknown threat actor in 2017 that went undetected until now. It uses a known VirtualBox exploit to disable Driver Signature Enforcement in Windows, but with a new twist: While it’s publicly known that VirtualBox driver VBoxDrv.sys v1.6.2 is vulnerable and used by Turla, this new malware uses the same exploit but with a slightly newer VirtualBox version. Sometimes, you are still able to find a technically interesting Windows malware that uses a new technique. This has become quite a rarity in today’s threat landscape where everything is either a copy of a copy of a copy or technically underwhelming. While AcidBox doesn’t use any fundamentally new methods, it breaks the myth that only VirtualBox VBoxDrv.sys 1.6.2 can be used for Turla’s exploit. Appending sensitive data as an overlay in icon resources, abusing the SSP interface for persistence and injection and payload storage in the Windows registry puts it into the category of interesting malware. The samples we dubbed AcidBox are only part of a bigger toolkit which we, unfortunately, could not identify. However, we provide two Yara rules for detection and threat hunting. Additionally, if you happen to find an additional sample, or are even infected, you can use the provided Python script to extract the sensitive data appended to the icon resources. All of these can be found here at Unit 42’s GitHub repository. If you have any further information about this threat, don’t hesitate to contact us. Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this malware. Our threat prevention platform with WildFire identifies this malware as malicious. AutoFocus customers can investigate this activity with the tag AcidBox. We would like to thank Dr.Web, Kaspersky, ESET and hFireF0X for their collaboration.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Today, our friends at FireEye released a report on an Iran-based adversary they are calling Saffron Rose. CrowdStrike Intelligence has also been tracking and reporting internally on this threat group since mid-January 2014 under the name FLYING KITTEN, and since that time has seen targeting of multiple U.S.-based defense contractors as well as political dissidents.FireEye’s report notes that this adversary’s targeted intrusion activity consists of credential theft and malware delivery individually. The FLYING KITTEN campaigns investigated by CrowdStrike Intelligence showed that the actor actually combines the two. For example, the adversary will register a domain that spoofs the name of the targeted organization and then host a spoofed login page on that site.The page is used to steal legitimate credentials, but once users enter the credentials, they are often redirected to a new page that prompts them to download a “Browser Patch” or other similar type of file. The downloaded file is actually the Stealer malware that exfiltrates stolen data to an FTP server. In addition to the aerospace/defense and dissident targeting, it also appears that FLYING KITTEN is also engaged in broader targeting via the website parmanpower[.]com. This website is registered via the same registrant email (info[@]usa.gov.us) and other Whois information as some of the other domains related to the activity discussed above. It purports to be the website of a business engaged in recruiting, training, and development in Erbil, Iraq.No malicious activity has been linked to this domain, however, the fact that it was registered under the same registrant email at the same time as other FLYING KITTEN domains linked to malicious activity, it is likely that the adversary is using this site for malicious purposes as well. The website does not appear to deliver any malware, so its most likely purpose is to act as a credential-collection mechanism much like the spoofed Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Aerospace Conference website (aeroconf2014[.]org) the adversary used earlier this year. This spoofed recruiting company website could be used to target entities across a wide range of sectors.Attribution in this case is interesting, as the adversary appears to have made a mistake when registering its malicious domains. The registrant email that currently appears in the Whois records of some of the FLYING KITTEN domains is info[@]usa.gov.us, however historical records show that the domains were originally registered under the email address keyvan.ajaxtm[@]gmail.com.As FireEye’s report notes, the keyvan.ajaxtm@gmail.com email address ties back to an Iran-based entity called Ajax Security Team. Earlier this year, Ajax Security had an easily identifiable presence on the Internet with its own website and related Facebook pages.This Internet presence has decreased significantly since early 2014, likely due to a desire to keep a lower profile now that the group is engaged in targeted intrusion activity. The following Yara rules will provide detection for the adversary remote access toolkit and exfiltration tool:You can use this rule with CrowdStrike’s free CrowdResponse tool to easily scan your systems for presence of FLYING KITTEN.

For example, the attackers targeted companies in the DIB using a fake conference page as a lure to trick targets into installing malicious software. In years past, Iranian actors primarily committed politically-motivated website defacement and DDoS attacks.1 More recently, however, suspected Iranian actors have destroyed data on thousands of computers with the Shamoon virus,2 and they have penetrated the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), which is used by the U.S. Navy worldwide. These attack vectors include sending email, private messages via social media, fake login pages, and the propagation of anti-censorship software that has been infected with malware. This model is consistent with the Basij’s recruitment of paramilitary volunteer hackers to “engage in less complex hacking or infiltration operations” leaving the more technical operations to entities over which they have increasingly direct control.13 As such, the capabilities of threat actors operating from Iran have traditionally been considered limited.14 However, the “Shamoon” attacks, which wiped computers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, indicate an improvement in capabilities.15 And unsurprisingly, Iran has reportedly increased its efforts to improve offensive capabilities after being targeted by Stuxnet and Flame.16We have observed the Ajax Security Team use a variety of vectors to lure targets into installing malicious software and/or revealing login credentials.

        "claim": "The Andariel Group is one of the most active threat groups in South Korea. In the early days, most attacks were designed to steal military information. ",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The Andariel group is a subgroup of the Lazarus group that has been active since 2015. Andariel has a connection to the cyber-attack named Operation Black Mine that occurred in 2014 and 2015. However, Operation Black Mine is also associated with the attacks on the South Korean Military Agency in 2008 and the attacks against South Korean banks and broadcastersin 2013 (a.k.a DarkSeoul). The major targets of the Andariel Group include not only military agencies, defense industries, political organizations, security companies, ICT companies, and energy research institutes, but also financial targets, such as ATMs, banks, travel agencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and online gambling users. Their main methods of attacks are spear phishing using macros, watering hole attacks exploiting Active-X vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploits on security and IT asset management systems, and supply chain attacks. The group makes use of well-known backdoors, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT, but also uses self-developed backdoors, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Rifdoor, and Phandoor. Furthermore, this group appears to know Korean language and its IT environment. This report examines the attacks by Andariel Threat Group, including key methods, and changes in their purpose and targets. The Andariel group uses a variety of attack techniques, and, in particular, they take advantage of vulnerabilities of local software in South Korea.The Andariel group uses the spear phishing method by understanding their target and sending emails with an attachment that appears to be from a relevant, seemingly trustworthy source. The attachments contain macro and trick the targeted recipient into activating the macro. However, this method of inducing macro activation has become more devious after 2015. [Figure 2] below shows the contents of attachments used in the 2015 attacks with the original method of inducing macro activation. The user can enable macro, but there is not a significant need to do so because the content is visible. However, malicious attachments found since 2017 show a new method. The contents of documents are blurred, as shown in [Figure 3], as if there is a problem with the display, increasing the likelihood of the recipients enabling the macros. The Andariel group also uses the watering hole technique, which compromise and inject exploit codes into a website. The targeted systems are infected with malware upon accessing the compromised website using a vulnerable web browser. These attacks also limit infection to specific IP address ranges, making it much more difficult to identify the attack targets. For the watering hole attack, the group usually embeds an Active-X vulnerability exploit codes in the target website. When the target accesses the website via an Internet Explorer browser with a specific Active-X installed the attack proceeds. After successful exploitation of the vulnerability, a JavaScript or VBScript file is created on the user system and this file downloads the malware from a specified address. Here, the “MZ” ASCII string, which represents a Windows executable file, does not exist within the file. The malware adds this text string starting with MZ from the local system to create an executable file. This method seems to be used to avoid detection by behavior-based security solutions when the executable file is downloaded. Institutions and companies of a certain size often manage multiple systems in their organizations, such as PCs, by connecting them to a central management solution. This central management solution is mainly responsible for Network Access Control (NAC); anti-virus management, software and hardware assets control; and patch management, and it usually provides features such as IT asset management, report generation, software distribution, and remote control. The attacker identifies and analyzes the central management solution used by the target institution or company to find and exploit the vulnerability. The attacks on the central management software can be categorized into two types: management server account attacks and vulnerability attacks on agents installed in the client. Most central management solutions consist of a management server and a client on which the agent is installed. The management server sends batch files to the connected systems or applies policies, and remotely controls the systems. The client processes files and commands sent from the management server. In the event of an attack using the management server, the attacker steals the targeted administrator account and distributes malware in the place of a normal file. This is the reason for the emphasis on management of administrator accounts. Another role of the management server is to receive the security updates for commercial software from external sources (software providers) and distributes them throughout the organization. However, if a file from the external update server tampers (e.g., by hacking); an update file containing malware will be distributed throughout the company or institution via the central management server. The client agent of the central management solution is responsible for receiving and executing the file transmitted from the management server. Generally, the agent has a feature to check whether the delivered command or file is verified. To bypass this process, the attacker pretends to be the management server and sends a command to the agent. The Andariel group is responsible for carrying out many attacks on central management solutions that are widely used in South Korea. The following are the cases of the group transferring malicious files exploiting the vulnerabilities of the client agent in three types of central management solution. The first case is malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution A, which was first discovered in 2015. When the malware is executed, the executable file, v3pscan.exe, containing malware is transmitted to the agent of central management solution A through a specified IP address and executed. Attacks on the central management solution B were made between 2015 and 2017. Various types of malware were used, such as nc.exe, nt.exe, n5lic.exe, nc5rt2.exe, and Bin.exe, to exploit the management system. Also, the attacker used a method of generating a VBScript file, such as vs1.vbs and winrm.vbs, to download malicious files. Variants of this malware were discovered between 2015 and 2017, which used the server IP, target system IP, download address, remote executable path, and other items as arguments to exploit systems and generate script files that downloaded malware. The generated script downloads a file from the address entered as an argument and restores 5 bytes. The malware that exploited the vulnerabilities in central management solution C was first found in September 2016. This attack performs malicious transferring and executing of files. The Andariel group is also known for their attacks on supply chain vulnerabilities. The primary attack method includes incorporating the malware in the software installer edition to infect the target via distribution from the official website and software updates. However, in some cases, the attack was not designed to infect all software users but only the specified target IP address. The group also used the supply chain attack to exploit vulnerabilities of software used in specific industries. The initial targets of the Andariel group were military agencies and the defense industry in South Korea. In 2015, there was an attack on exhibitors in the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX). ADEX is an international defense industry exhibition that has been hosted bi-annually since 1996. The attacker sent an email with an Excel or Word document containing macros, pretending to be the organizer of the event. The attached document was disguised as a legitimate content, and malware was downloaded when the recipient opened the file and clicked “Use Content” to activate the macro. The downloaded file was a Rifdoor variant. From the document file found later, it seems that the attack group focused on its attacks mainly on the defense industry. [Table 1] below summarizes significant attacks made by the Andariel group. In February 2016, a Korean security company was hacked, and an electronic certificate was leaked. Recently in August 2018, an additional malware was discovered to be distributed as a legitimate DRM program. In April 2016, defense industry, marine service providers, and ICT companies were infected with Gh0st RAT, a malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution B. In June 2016, the Korean police agency unveiled operation Gh0st RAT, a large-scale hacking incident on mega companies in the defense industry that exploited the vulnerabilities in centralized management solutions. Gh0st RAT is a malware that attempts to infect the target through the file distribution function using the vulnerabilities of central management solution A, and about 40,000 documents were leaked by the Gh0st RAT malware. Ever since August 2016, the Andariel group has exploited the vulnerabilities in anti-virus management programs to attack military agencies and leak information. From the end of 2016, the purpose of the attack changed from information leakage to monetary gain. In October 2016, the attacker hacked the website of a software provider and replaced the installation file with a file containing malware to release malicious codes that served as cheats in online gambling games. In 2017, to maximize the chances of a successful attack, malware was distributed to multiple computers using an internet cafe management program. In March 2017, a case was discovered where credit card information was leaked due to the hacking of an ATM in Korea. It seems attempts were made from November 2016, and the malware used in the attack was similar to those used in the leaking of a military agency’s data in 2016. From May to July 2017, there were concentrated attacks on the financial industry. The malware was distributed through the website of monetary unions, and the attacks attempted to exploit the vulnerability of their systems. In October 2017, the largest travel agency in Korea was hacked, resulting in the leakage of personal information. Moreover, travel agency was hacked in December of the same year. In December 2017, the Andariel group modified the ERP solution update file of a company A and added malware to the file. At that time, malware was downloaded only to attack a specific target company, and not all companies using the ERP solution.In December 2017, the Andariel group launched attacks on virtual currency exchange users. In January 2018, it distributed a remote support program containing malware. In February 2018, the group employed various types of attacks, including the email attack where it impersonated the office of a National Assembly member. Malware used in the email attack was a variant of the malware used in the ATM hacking in 2017, and another variant was used in the attacks on the financial industry in June. The Andariel group uses in-house advanced malware, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Phandoor, and Rifdoor, as well as other well-known malware, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT.Gh0st RAT is a backdoor made in China, and its source codes are publicly available. The Andariel group used this malware for attacks from 2015 to 2016. It created and used a Korean version in some cases. Packagers, such as Themida packaged some variants. Rifdoor was first discovered in November 2015, and it remained active until early 2016. A Rifdoor variant was used to attack SEOUL ADEX exhibitors in 2015 and was found in the hacking incidents of security companies in early 2016. Rifdoor is characterized by the string included in the PDB information: E:\\Data\\My Projects\\Troy Source Code\\tcp1st\\rifle\\Release\\rifle.pdb. When it enters the system, Rifdoor generates a file by adding garbage data to the 4 bytes of the last part of the file. Therefore, since the hash value changes each time the system is infected, the malware cannot be found in the system with a simple hash value. Phandoor was used from January 2016 to the summer of 2017. It is characterized by having the string “S^%” before the main character strings. (E.g. S^%s\\cmd.exe, S^nehomegpa.dll) However, some variants found in 2017 did not contain its character string, “Anonymous?” The Andariel group has launched many attacks using a variety of malware. In addition to the similarity of their codes, factors are indicating the association between these attacks. Results from the detailed analysis of AhnLab shows that the Andariel group and Operation Black Mine take the similar attack methods, and in particular, they both used the file, zcon.exe. This suggests that Operation Black Mine is associated with the Andariel group. The similar malware was used to attack various targets, and some of them used the same C2.The Andariel Group is one of the most active threat groups in South Korea. In the early days, most attacks were designed to steal military information. Since the end of 2016, however, attacks have also been made for monetary gain. In addition, based on their frequent attacks using vulnerabilities of software used by the target, it can be seen that the group is well aware of Korea IT environment. As evident in the attack cases of the group, central management solutions of companies and institutions can become a route of an attack at any time. Attacks exploiting a central management solution may cause enormous damage throughout the organization. Thus, more strengthened security management is required. In particular, a security policy for the management server of a central management solution is critical. Suitable management is required to ensure that necessary security policies are observed, such as frequently changing administrator’s login password of the management server and not saving it in the system, as well as limiting the access to the management server. In addition, logs must be checked periodically to make sure that abnormal files have not been distributed via the management server. There was a case where the attacker exploited the vulnerability in an agent installed in the client without going through the management server, so it is necessary to monitor whether or not scanning of the port number used by the central management solution occurs. Attackers use a variety of methods in their attempts to infiltrate companies and institutions. Most organizations focus on strengthening security on endpoints, but it is just as much essential to monitor events that occur in the internal infrastructure, just like the central management solution.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",

        "explain": "The New York Times has had a rough year with China. After publishing an article about the secret wealth of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, the New York Times website was blocked in mainland China and on the country's social media. Following that, one of the paper's Beijing-based correspondents, Chris Buckley, was given a difficult time obtaining a press visa and had to temporarily leave the country. Now, the Times found out it has been persistently attacked by Chinese hackers for the past four months. The nature of the hack had experts believing it was coming from a Chinese cyberattack group, dubbed APT-12 in the U.S. for Advanced Persistent Threat 12. An APT essentially means hackers are able to have access to a system for an extended or continuous amount of time, accessing the information whenever they please. According to the New York Times, the computer systems and passwords of several reporters and other employees, including the email account of Shanghai bureau chief David Barboza, who wrote the initial report on Wen Jiabao’s family wealth, were accessed by APT entities. The Times believes that the hack was initiated only to seek information pertaining to the reporting on the Wen family. The Times hired information security firm Mandiant to track and stop the hack, which was eventually traced to Chinese sources. Mandiant advisors are under the impression that the attacks came from the same computers used to attack United States military contractors in the past, an action that may have come from the Chinese military.Dmitri Alperovitch, a technology security expert and co-founder of CrowdStrike, a cybersecurities company, once said, “There are two kinds of Fortune 500 companies: those that know they’ve been hacked and those that don’t know yet.” Mandiant Chief Security Officer Richard Bejtlich estimates that Chinese APT intruders alone have likely infiltrated 30 percent to 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Mandiant is well-versed in hacking attacks from China. The company does extensive research on hacking patterns and has defined a general configuration for what Chinese APT activity looks like. For the most part, China’s APT hackers tend to infiltrate industries or companies aligned with the strategic objectives of the local government.“We at Mandiant have considered the strategic impact this change will have on APT groups and the current cyberespionage campaign that has been traced back to the PRC,” Christopher Lew, a senior strategic analyst at the U.S. Department of Defense and an expert on Chinese military history and thought, wrote in a report for Mandiant. Mandiant experts have reason to believe that China’s new leadership will only further the nation’s commitment to using intelligence coming from APT attacks, especially to benefit Chinese state-owned enterprises. For example, Chinese state-owned companies have had the unusual ability to increase the speed and efficiency of “manufacturing and development processes for high-tech products, negotiate acquisitions or service deals on highly favorable terms or force competing companies to change their business plans altogether,” Lew reported. Impressively fast developments have been seen in the nation’s weapon systems in the past year, like the nation’s first advanced ballistic missile and new J-14 warplane. Though many believe this is a result of China’s booming economy and shift toward domestic innovation, Mandiant believes APT espionage on foreign entities contributed to China’s remarkable technological advancement.“If one takes into account the ... data stolen by APT groups that Mandiant has seen during its engagements, the leaps and bounds that PRC companies have made is much more feasible and explainable,” Lew explained. On a commercial level, the aggressive business culture in China coupled with the scarce effectiveness of intellectual property laws has created a market for corporate espionage. “The availability of trained personnel, tools, methodology and companies that are willing to cut corners or to not ask questions regarding the sources of information make for a profitable hacking industry,” Lew said.Of course, there is no publicly confirmed proof of PRC government-sponsored cyberespionage. Beijing has openly addressed, and dismissed, accusations of government-led network spying; Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, called U.S. government reports suggesting Chinese spying “unprofessional and irresponsible.”\n\n\n",

APT.Ixeshe, malware programs previously associated with APT 12, as well as command and control infrastructure attributed to the group, Moran said. The Chinese hacker group that broke into the computer network of The New York Times and other high-profile organizations, including defense contractors, has launched new attacks following a few months of inactivity, according to researchers from security vendor FireEye. The attacks used new variants of Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.

Key points of the blogpost: ESET Research discovered a sophisticated backdoor with unusual architecture that we have named Deadglyph. The main components are encrypted using a machine-specific key. Traditional backdoor commands are implemented via additional modules received from its C&C server. We obtained three out of many modules – process creator, file reader, and info collector. We attribute Deadglyph to the Stealth Falcon group. Additionally, we found a related shellcode downloader; we postulate it could potentially be used for installation of Deadglyph. The victim of the analyzed infiltration is a governmental entity in the Middle East that was compromised for espionage purposes. A related sample found on VirusTotal was also uploaded to the file-scanning platform from this region, specifically from Qatar. Stealth Falcon (also known as Project Raven or FruityArmor) is a threat group linked to the United Arab Emirates according to MITRE. Active since 2012, Stealth Falcon is known to target political activists, journalists, and dissidents in the Middle East. It was first discovered and described by Citizen Lab, which published an analysis of a campaign of spyware attacks in 2016. In January 2019, Reuters published an investigative report on Project Raven, an initiative allegedly employing former NSA operatives and aiming at the same types of targets as Stealth Falcon. Based on these two reports referring to the same targets and attacks, Amnesty International has concluded (shown in Figure 2) that Stealth Falcon and Project Raven actually are the same group.In September 2019, we published research on a backdoor, attributed to Stealth Falcon, that used an unusual technique, Background Intelligent Transfer Service, for C&C communication. We now reveal the result of our in-depth analysis of what presumably is the newest addition to Stealth Falcon’s espionage toolset.Deadglyph’s loading chain consists of multiple components, as illustrated in Figure 3. The initial component is a registry shellcode loader, which loads shellcode from the registry. This extracted shellcode, in turn, loads the native x64 part of the backdoor – the Executor. The Executor subsequently loads the .NET part of the backdoor – the Orchestrator. Notably, the only component on system’s disk as a file is the initial component, which is in the form of a Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The remaining components are encrypted and stored within a binary registry value.While the precise method of the initial compromise vector is not yet determined, our suspicion is that an installer component is involved in deploying further components and establishing persistence within the system. In the rest of this section, we analyze each component.Deadglyph’s initial component is a tiny DLL with a single export, named 1. This component is persisted using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription and serves as a registry shellcode loader. It is executed via the command line rundll32.The registry shellcode loader begins its operation by decrypting the path to the encrypted shellcode stored within the Windows registry, using RC4. We suspect the path is unique for each victim; in the case analyzed here,The root registry key is either HKLM or HKCU, depending on whether the current process is running with elevated privileges or not. The same logic can be found in further components. Following this, the loader derives a machine-specific RC4 key using the system UUID retrieved from the raw SMBIOS firmware table. Using this key, it loads, decrypts, and then executes the shellcode. It is important to highlight that this key derivation approach ensures that proper decryption won’t occur if the loader is executed on a different computer. Interestingly, the loader can also be configured by a flag in its .data section to use a hardcoded key to decrypt the shellcode, instead of the machine-specific one. We spotted a homoglyph attack mimicking Microsoft Corporation in the VERSIONINFO resource of this and other PE components. This method employs distinct Unicode characters that appear visually similar, but in this case not identical, to the original characters, specifically Greek Capital Letter San (U+03FA, Ϻ) and Cyrillic Small Letter O (U+043E, о) in Ϻicrоsоft Corpоratiоn.Comprised of two parts, the registry shellcode consists of a decryption routine and an encrypted body. First, the decryption routine rotates each byte of the encrypted body to the left by one (ROL 0x01). Subsequently, control is transferred to this decrypted body. The decrypted body consists of a PE loader and a PE file, the latter being the Executor, which represents the native part of the backdoor. This loader is responsible for parsing and loading the associated PE file.The Executor is the native x64 part of the Deadglyph backdoor, which does the following: loads its configuration, initializes the .NET runtime, loads the embedded .NET part of the backdoor (the Orchestrator), and acts as a library for the Orchestrator. First, two default configurations embedded in the .data section are AES-decrypted. The configurations encompass various parameters, including encryption keys, safety and evasion settings, and the entry point of the subsequent component. During the initial execution, those two default configurations are stored within the Windows registry, from where they are loaded on subsequent runs, enabling the implementation of updates. The registry path for each configuration is generated with the following format.Following this, the .NET runtime is initialized, then the Executor RC4-decrypts the .NET part of the backdoor known as the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator is located within the .rsrc section of the Executor. The configuration specifies the Orchestrator’s execution method as an entry point. Moreover, a distinct structure is provided to facilitate accessibility of the Executor’s functions by the Orchestrator. After launching the Orchestrator, the Executor acts as a support library for the Orchestrator. The Executor contains many interesting functions; we describe some of them in the following section, in context of their utilization by the Orchestrator and further loaded modules.Written in .NET, the Orchestrator is the main component of the Deadglyph backdoor. This component’s primary role involves establishing communication with the C&C server and executing commands, often facilitated through the intermediary role of the Executor. In contrast to the preceding components, the Orchestrator is obfuscated, employing .NET Reactor. Internally, the backdoor is referred to as agent, which is a common name for the client part in various post-exploitation frameworks.The Orchestrator first loads its configuration and two embedded modules, each accompanied by its own set of configurations, from resources. These resources are Deflate compressed and AES encrypted. They are referenced by an ID that is SHA-1 hashed into a resource name.The configuration of the Orchestrator and embedded modules is stored in XML format. After the resource components are loaded, multiple threads are created to carry out distinct tasks. One of these threads is responsible for conducting environment checks, a function implemented within the Executor. Another thread is devoted to establishing periodic communication with the C&C server, enabling the retrieval of commands. Lastly, a set of three threads is employed for the purpose of executing received commands and subsequently transmitting any generated output back to the C&C server. The environment-checking thread monitors running processes to identify unwanted ones. This thread operates with two distinct lists of process names. If a process on the first list is detected, C&C communication and command execution is paused until the unwanted process no longer exists. If there is a match for any process on the second list, the backdoor immediately quits and uninstalls itself. Neither list was configured in the analyzed instance, so we don’t know what processes might typically be checked for; we believe it is probably intended to evade analysis tools that could detect suspicious activity and lead to discovery of the backdoor.The Orchestrator utilizes two embedded modules for C&C communication – Timer and Network. Like the Orchestrator, these modules are obfuscated with .NET Reactor. The configuration for both modules is supplied by the Orchestrator. Within the Orchestrator, a preset configuration for the modules is included; optionally, the Orchestrator can also load an updated configuration version from the registry.The backdoor contains an interesting safety measure related to communication. If the backdoor is unable to establish communication with the C&C server for a duration surpassing a predefined threshold, configured within the Executor, a self-uninstallation mechanism is triggered. This time threshold is specified in hours and was set at one hour in the examined case. This approach serves a twofold purpose. On one hand, it prevents the generation of redundant network requests towards an inaccessible server. On the other hand, it reduces the chances of subsequent detection if the operators lose control over the backdoor.This small module executes the specified callback at a configurable interval. It is used by the Orchestrator in combination with the Network module to communicate with the C&C server periodically. To prevent the creation of detectable patterns in network logs, the execution interval is subject to randomization, based on a percentage specified in the configuration. In the analyzed instance, the interval was set to five minutes, with a ±20% variation introduced for randomness. Another method to avoid detectable network patterns in periodic communication can be found in generation of requests sent to the C&C server. This mechanism, implemented in the Executor, involves the inclusion of padding of varying length, comprised of random bytes, within the requests, resulting in requests of diverse sizes.The Network module implements communication with the C&C servers specified in its configuration. It can send data to a C&C server using HTTP(S) POST requests. Notably, it offers several mechanisms to acquire proxy configuration details. This feature suggests a potential focus on environments where direct internet access is not available.Configuration entries contain details related to network communications – C&C URLs, HTTP User-Agent, and optionally a proxy configuration. When communicating with the C&C server, a custom binary protocol with encrypted content is used underneath HTTPS.The Orchestrator receives commands from the C&C server in the form of tasks, which are queued for execution. There are three kinds of tasks processed: Orchestrator tasks, Executor tasks, and Upload tasks. The first two kinds are received from the C&C server and the third is created internally to upload the output of commands and errors.Orchestrator tasks offer the ability to manage the configuration of the Network and Timer modules, and also to cancel pending tasks.Executor tasks offer the ability to manage the backdoor and execute additional modules. It’s notable that the traditional backdoor functionality is not inherently present within the binary itself. Instead, these functions are obtained from the C&C server in the form of PE files or shellcode. The full extent of the backdoor’s potential remains unknown without these additional modules, which effectively unlock its true capabilities. An overview of module tasks is shown in Table 4, which includes details about the few identified modules. The command that sets the Executor configuration can change the: unwanted process lists, time threshold of C&C communication failure, and time limit for execution of additional modules.We managed to obtain three unique modules from the C&C server, each corresponding to a different Executor task type, as shown in Table 4. Based on available information, we estimate there are nine to fourteen modules in total. As the modules are in fact backdoor commands, they have one basic operation to execute and then optionally return their output. The modules we obtained are DLLs with one unnamed export (ordinal 1), in which they resolve necessary API functions and call the main function. When executed, the modules are provided with an API resolution function, which can resolve Windows APIs and custom Executor APIs. The Windows APIs are referenced by a DWORD hash, calculated from the name of the API and its DLL. Small hash values (<41) are treated specially, referencing the Executor API function. The Executor API comprises a total of 39 functions that are accessible to the modules. Module 0x69 executes the specified command line as a new process and provides the resulting output back to the Orchestrator. The process can be created under a different user, and its execution time can be limited. Notably, an unusual Job API is used in this module’s functionality. This module was served with the command line cmd.exe /c tasklist /v. We assume it serves as an idle command issued automatically, while the operators wait for something interesting to happen on the compromised computer.Module 0x6C collects extensive information about the computer via WMI queries and passes it back to the Orchestrator. Module 0x64 reads the specified file and passes the content back to the Orchestrator. Optionally, it can delete the file after reading.In the process of investigating Deadglyph, we encountered a dubious CPL file signed with an expired certificate and no countersignature with a timestamp, which had been uploaded to VirusTotal from Qatar. Upon closer examination, it became evident that this CPL file functioned as a multistage shellcode downloader, sharing certain code resemblances with Deadglyph. In its initial form, which serves as the first stage, this file anticipates having a .cpl extension (Control Panel file) and is meant to be executed via a double-click action. Upon execution in this manner, the embedded shellcode undergoes XOR decryption, and the running processes are checked to identify a suitable host process for subsequent injection. If avp.exe (a Kaspersky endpoint security process) is running, %windir%\\system32\\UserAccountBroker.exe is used. Otherwise, the default browser is used. Then, it creates the host process in a suspended state, injects the shellcode by hijacking its main thread, and resumes the thread. The second stage, the shellcode, consists of two parts. The first part of the shellcode resolves API hashes, using the same unique hash calculation technique employed in Deadglyph, and decrypts strings with process names. It starts a self-delete thread tasked with overwriting and subsequently erasing the first-stage file. Following this, the shellcode proceeds to inspect the currently active processes, targeting a security solution. If any of the specified processes are detected, the shellcode creates a sleeper thread with the lowest priority (THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE) and allows it to remain active for a duration of 60 seconds before terminating its operation. This interval is likely implemented as a precautionary measure to evade certain detection mechanisms employed by security solutions. Finally, the shellcode proceeds to invoke the execution of the second part of its code. The second part of the shellcode loads an embedded PE file with stage three and calls its export with ordinal number 1. The third stage, a DLL, serves as a .NET loader and contains the payload in its .rsrc section. To load the payload, the .NET runtime is initialized. During the .NET initialization, two intriguing techniques are performed, seemingly intended to evade Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) scanning: The .NET loader temporarily hooks the GetModuleHandleW import in the loaded clr.dll, while calling ICorRuntimeHost::Start. The hook tampers with the return value when GetModuleHandleW is called with NULL. It returns a pointer to a dummy PE with no sections. It then subtly patches the AmsiInitialize import name string in the .rdata section of the loaded clr.dll to amsiinitialize. The fourth stage is a .NET assembly, obfuscated with ConfuserEx, that serves as a shellcode downloader. First, it XOR-decrypts its configuration in XML format from its resources. A beautified version of the extracted configuration is presented in Figure 7. The configuration entries contain details related to network communication and blocklisted processes.Before proceeding, it checks the running processes against a list of blocklisted processes from the configuration. If a match is detected, the execution halts. It is important to note that in the analyzed instance, this blocklist wasn’t set up. Next, it sends an HTTP GET request to the C&C server to retrieve some shellcode, using parameters specified in the configuration (URL, User-Agent, and optionally Proxy). Regrettably, during our investigation we were unable to acquire any shellcode from the C&C server. Nonetheless, we hypothesize that the content being retrieved could potentially serve as the installer for Deadglyph. Following this, the retrieved shellcode is executed within a newly created thread. After waiting until the shellcode thread finishes execution, the shellcode downloader removes all files located in the directory %WINDIR%\\ServiceProfiles\\LocalService\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TfsStore\\Tfs_DAV. Finally, it makes an attempt to delete itself after a 20-second interval, employing the subsequent command, before concluding its operation and exiting: cmd.exe choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 20 & Del /f /q This self-deletion does not make sense in this chain. This is due to the fact that the shellcode downloader is executed within a browser or system process after being injected, rather than operating as an independent executable. Moreover, the initial file was already deleted by the second stage. This observation suggests that the shellcode downloader might not be an exclusive payload of this chain and may also be used separately in other operations.We have discovered and analyzed a sophisticated backdoor used by the Stealth Falcon group that we have named Deadglyph. It has an unusual architecture, and its backdoor capabilities are provided by its C&C in the form of additional modules. We managed to obtain three of these modules, uncovering a fraction of Deadglyph’s full capabilities. Notably, Deadglyph boasts a range of counter-detection mechanisms, including continuous monitoring of system processes and the implementation of randomized network patterns. Furthermore, the backdoor is capable of uninstalling itself to minimize the likelihood of its detection in certain cases. Additionally, our investigation led us to the discovery of a compelling multistage shellcode downloader chain on VirusTotal. We suspect this downloader chain is likely leveraged in the installation process of Deadglyph.\n\n\n",

Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier. To date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia.

        "explain": "In 2019, Business Email Compromise (BEC) maintained its rankings as both the most profitable and the most prominent threat facing our customers. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which recently released its annual report, US$1.77 billion in losses were attributed to BEC attacks over the course of 2019. This number dwarfed losses associated with romance scams, identity theft, credit card fraud, phishing, and ransomware combined over the same period. With cases reported across all 50 states and in 177 countries, the FBI also published a press release in September 2019 announcing that in the preceding three-year period, BEC losses eclipsed US$26 billion globally. Put into perspective, the known and reported losses associated with this threat now exceed the estimated global losses from WannaCry (an estimated US$4 billion) and NotPetya (an estimated US$10 billion) combined.Recognizing the severity of the threat combined with its impacts on our customers, Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 researchers continue to focus a core area of their research on Nigerian cybercrime, given the dominant proportionality and sheer enormity of BEC attacks originating from the region. Assigned the name SilverTerrier, these actors have now collectively produced more than 81,300 samples of malware linked to 2.1 million attacks. From their humble beginnings as a few individuals experimenting with commodity malware in 2014, our recent global data shows the number of threat actors has grown significantly to encompass over 480 different actors and groups that we track today. In five years (from 2014 to 2019), SilverTerrier actors have evolved from being novice threat adversaries to mature cybercriminals. According to our latest findings, we saw an 1163% increase in BEC attacks against the professional and legal services industry in 2019. While we lack insight into the root cause, this jump nevertheless demonstrates a significant shift in targeting practices amongst SilverTerrier actors. Peaking at 245,637 BEC attacks in June 2019, the year ended with an average of 92,739 BEC attacks per month, representing a 172% increase from 2018. Of those BEC attacks, 97.8% leveraged email protocols to reach target networks. The most common tools that SilverTerrier actors used to attack organizations once they infiltrated those networks were information stealers and remote administration tools (RATs). In this report, we identify the trends associated with SilverTerrier attacks, provide a refined adversary profile for network defenders, highlight the implications associated with the emergence of the first Nigerian commodity tool developer, and provide an overview of actions Palo Alto Networks is undertaking internally and externally to address this threat.In 2018 we noted an average of 34,039 attacks per month against our customer base. Over the course of 2019, those metrics have more than doubled, as monthly attack rates crossed the 50K, then 100K, and ultimately the 200K thresholds. Peaking at 245,637 attacks in June, 2019 ended with an average of 92,739 attacks per month, representing a 172% increase from 2018. Furthermore, while we continue to assess that this growth is representative of global trends, it remains important to note that our metrics only reflect attacks against our customer base, and as such, the total number of global attacks launched by these actors is presumed to be far greater.Exploring the targets of these attacks, we found that Nigerian threat actors remain indiscriminate in their targeting. Our data shows attacks targeted all industry segments, including small to large businesses, healthcare organizations, and even local, state, and federal government institutions. In measuring the top five targeted industries, we found the following: The high-tech industry received the greatest number of attacks, nearly doubling from 164K in 2018 to 313K in 2019. Close behind with 248K attacks, the professional and legal services industry advanced from being the fifth-most targeted industry in 2018 to the second-most targeted industry in 2019. Fueled by an alarming 1163% increase in attacks in 2019, this jump demonstrates a significant shift in targeting practices amongst SilverTerrier actors. The manufacturing industry was third, with 145K attacks in 2019, up from 68K in 2018. The education industry was fourth, with 143K attacks in 2019, up from 53K in 2018. The wholesale and retail industry was fifth, observing 107K attacks in 2019, reflective of a marginal 15% increase from 2018. Taking a look at delivery vectors, we found that 97.8% of attacks leveraged email protocols to reach target networks, thus stressing the importance of employing and enabling security solutions capable of evaluating content entering corporate networks through these protocols. At the top of the list, SMTP traffic accounted for 864K (69%) of attacks observed in 2019. POP3 and IMAP accounted for 324K (26%) and 35K (2.8%) attacks, respectively. It is also worth noting that the number of attacks witnessed in IMAP traffic dropped for the first time in 2019. We assess that this drop is likely due to customers shifting away from IMAP, as they modernize and adopt SMTP as an industry standard. Beyond email, web browsing served as the fourth most common delivery vector in 2019 with 24K (1.9%) of attacks. We only observed 3.6K (.3%) attacks delivered through FTP traffic.In years past, we have highlighted the ever-expanding ability of SilverTerrier actors to employ new technologies, tactics, and capabilities designed to advance their fraudulent schemes. Concurrently, the cybersecurity industry has historically characterized Nigerian malware actors as an emerging, rather than an established threat. As the analysis of this threat group turns five years old, we believe it is now pivotal to recognize that in many aspects, SilverTerrier actors have evolved to a point where they are demonstrating signs of maturity consistent with established threat groups in their delivery techniques, malware packaging, and technical abilities. Over the course of 2019, our cloud-delivered WildFire® malware analysis service identified 27,310 samples of SilverTerrier malware. The vast majority of these samples were commodity malware tools, which employed a variety of obfuscation techniques designed to deceive traditional signature-based antivirus programs. A comparison of these samples to VirusTotal revealed an average detection rate of 57.3% across all vendors at the time of discovery, demonstrating the effectiveness of obfuscation techniques against legacy antivirus platforms. A subsequent comparison conducted at the end of 2019 identified a greater proportion of samples available on the platform, but this increase, unfortunately, did not yield any notable improvements in detection rates across vendors. Counter-intuitively, the average rate actually decreased slightly to 57.1%, demonstrating that even with the benefit of time and prolonged exposure to the cybersecurity community, these samples remain undetected by over 40% of antivirus solutions. By performing an analysis of the commodity malware tools themselves, we found that Nigerian threat actors continued to adopt new, and abandon old, capabilities consistent with tool popularity, effectiveness, detection rates, availability, and other market factors. In tracking these trends, the following sections provide key insights designed to: Inform network administrators of the top threats facing their networks; Guide the cybersecurity industry in prioritizing detection and remediation capabilities; and Enable law enforcement to focus on attribution and legal process against the most prevalent tools.Information stealers are tools designed with a core information-stealing component that most commonly captures screenshots, passwords, and other sensitive files on an infected system. Once captured, the malicious programs then package and transmit these stolen items via various protocols to internet infrastructure controlled by a malign actor. Over the past five years, we have tracked the use of 10 different commodity information stealer families by SilverTerrier actors. Over time, as new tools emerge on the market, the older, less effective tools have faded in popularity. Our data shows that usage of the following five tools has subsequently dropped to negligible levels: Atmos, Keybase, ISpySoftware, ISR Stealer, and Zeus.Conversely, there are five tools that still remain in active use with SilverTerrier actors: AgentTesla, AzoRult, Lokibot, Pony, and PredatorPain. Our analysis of these malware families found that Nigerian threat actors produced an average of 516 unique samples per month in 2019 (Figure 4). However, despite a steady flow of new samples each month, the usage of information stealers appears to have peaked in 2017, before entering a continued state of decline. While the root cause of this decline is hard to pinpoint, we assess that the lack of new tools entering the market, advancements in the cybersecurity landscape, increased law enforcement actions, routine exposure of control infrastructure, and a shift toward RATs by these actors are all contributing factors.Amongst the five active tools in this category, we found that SilverTerrier actors only produced three tools in quantities greater than 50 samples per month. Consistent with 2018, LokiBot was the most popular tool in 2019, with an average of 291 new samples per month. However, this average was inflated largely by an anomalous, single month high of 1240 samples in May 2019. Pony, also known as Fareit, was second with an average of 146 samples per month, but production largely declined throughout the year. Finally, we observed a small uptick in the adoption of AzoRult in 2019, resulting in an average of 55 samples per month throughout the year.On the other end of the spectrum, PredatorPain, a tool that has received multiple updates over the years, continues to decline from its peak usage in 2016 with actors producing an average of only 17 samples per month in 2019. Additionally, AgentTesla, a small .NET keylogger, has also declined since its peak usage in 2017, with actors now producing an average of less than four new samples per month in 2019.RATs are programs designed to provide remote access to compromised systems. These tools expand beyond the basic capture of sensitive files inherent with information stealers, and typically allow their users to interact directly with victim machines. To that end, these tools are often more complex than information stealers in terms of code and infrastructure requirements. Leveraging these tools, Nigerian threat actors can modify systems, access network resources, and perform common functions on behalf of compromised users. Over the past five years, we have tracked SilverTerrier use of 13 different RAT families. Similar to other types of commodity malware, these tools rise and fall in popularity, and over the course of 2019, our data shows that usage of LuminosityLink, NJRat, Quasar, and WarZone RATs have all dropped to negligible levels. The nine RATs that remain in varying degrees of active use are: Netwire, DarkComet, NanoCore, Remcos, ImminentMonitor, Adwind, Hworm, Revenge, and WSHRat. Combined, SilverTerrier actors produced an average of 609 samples per month in 2019, representing an impressive 140% growth in production from 2018 (Figure 7). This growth represents the first time that the production and employment of RATs has exceeded the sample rate for information stealers over the five years that we have tracked this threat group. We assess that this shift is largely indicative of growing technical abilities, combined with the effectiveness of these tools in enabling fraudulent schemes. Further, we anticipate that this growth trend will continue throughout 2020, as we see increasing numbers of actors adopting these tools.The most popular RATs have narrowed in 2019. In 2018, there were six tools that exceeded averages of 50 samples per month, while in 2019 that number dropped to just two. The most popular was NanoCore, with an average of 384 samples per month, signaling a 520% increase. This result remains particularly fascinating because the tool developer was arrested in 2017. Yet, despite his initial incarceration, a “cracked” version of the tool remains freely available, and given its effectiveness, it has become the “tool du jour”. The second most popular tool in 2019 was Netwire in which we observed an average of 64 samples per month. While SilverTerrier actors have used this tool since 2014, it remains popular due to a small, but loyal, following of actors.In contrast, we found seven RATs in active use with stalled adoption and minimal deployment throughout 2019. Of the seven, Remcos, first seen in 2016, and DarkComet, first seen in 2014, stood out as the only two to maintain relatively stable sample rates. The average sample rate for Remcos was 42 samples per month, while DarkComet’s was 24 samples per month. Conversely, usage of Adwind, Revenge, and ImminentMonitor all declined over the course of the year, with sample rates of 36, 6, and 5 samples per month, respectively. Of note, Palo Alto Networks also identified the developers behind Adwind and ImminentMonitor, and collaborated with international law enforcement to subsequently dismantle global ImminentMonitor infrastructure. Finally, the connection between HWorm and WSHRat is noteworthy. The code for HWorm, originally released in 2013, has been repackaged with several tools over the years. However, while SilverTerrier usage was first observed in March 2018, HWorm usage was brief. The tool peaked in November 2018 before declining through April 2019, with an average of only 12 samples per month. Coincidently, samples of WSHRat, which we assess to be a Nigerian variant of HWorm, began to appear that same month (April 2019), and continued throughout the year resulting in an average of 33 samples per month.In 2014, Unit 42 published its first research identifying a small group of Nigerian threat actors employing malware for financial gain. Over the past five years, the number of actors involved in this activity has grown substantially. As of this publication, we have attributed attacks to more than 480 Nigerian threat actors and groups. Combined, these actors have registered more than 23,300 fraudulent and malicious domains. Many of these domains have directly supported command and control (C2) activities for the roughly 81,300 samples of malware associated with 2.1 million attacks against our customer base. Focusing on the actors themselves, we have found that corporate network security teams traditionally tend to explain threats to their respective organizations in terms of capabilities and vulnerabilities, while often discounting the perpetrating actors as elusive, amorphous, and faceless adversaries. This habit forms naturally due to the plethora of difficulties associated with attributing APT level and ransomware activities to specific individuals with unique motivations. However, in the world of cybercrime, attribution is often easier to achieve and as such, details about SilverTerrier attackers are within grasp. Thus, in seeking to enable network defenders and more importantly, their corporate employees, to better understand and defend against this threat, we believe there is value in providing a deep dive into a profile of a typical SilverTerrier actor. Additionally, we provide a description of the first Nigerian commodity tool developer in order to better illuminate the fundamental human nature and motivations of this threat.Actor X is an actual person and is one of the more active SilverTerrier actors that we track. He holds an undergraduate degree from the Federal University of Technology in Owerri (FUTO). Following graduation, he completed a year of national service with the National Youth Service Corps in Nigeria. Now in his early 40’s, he is married and the proud parent of three children. Together, they live in Owerri, Nigeria, where he appears to be active in the community and presents himself as a legitimate businessman, providing technical services. Additionally, like many threat actors, he maintains accounts on Facebook and Skype, in which his contacts include friends, family, other malware actors, local law enforcement, and prominent figures from his community. In terms of online activity, Actor X has registered more than 480 domains for the purpose of supporting other threat actors, as well as his own fraudulent activities. In order to register these domains, he has built over 90 email accounts with common email providers such as Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google. While these accounts all follow a pattern of using an alias or nickname followed by a number, his platform diversification strategy guarantees a degree of redundancy should one of the providers take action to close these accounts. Finally, as it applies to his illicit activity, this single threat actor has produced more than 4,000 samples of malware. These samples are associated with 15 different malware families that he has experimented with over time, as his skills have improved from novice to advanced. Combined, we have observed these samples in over 363K mostly automated attacks against our customers. In doing so, we assess that his attack technique is largely indiscriminate, as he has targeted over 2,600 customers including 93 local, state, and federal government entities across 31 states. Combining all of these characteristics empowers a refined understanding of the threat targeting our customers. Specifically, the adversary is a person (not a vulnerability or piece of software) who has a technical college education, has put in the time to develop a web of online aliases required for his campaigns, and is following a strategy of deploying malware indiscriminately, and at scale, with the motivation of generating the income necessary to support his family.In January 2018, an unknown developer began advertising a new tool called “FUD Crypt” on the popular hacking website HackForums[.]net. Priced at $65 a month, the developer also posted a tutorial on YouTube, demonstrating how to use his new cryptor to make RATs, keyloggers, and other malware files undetectable to antivirus solutions. Eleven months later, in December 2018, a second tool called “Unknown Crypter” hit the market in a similar fashion with similar capabilities. Priced at $20 a week, this tool also came with a YouTube tutorial. Common amongst both tutorials was the fact that the developer took the time to provide credit to the source of the royalty-free music used in each video.Following the release of both of these tools, in April 2019, we saw a new variant of HWorm RAT hit the market in VBScript and JavaScript languages packaged as “WSHRat”. Priced at $24 a month, this tool once again came with its very own YouTube tutorial that, like the previous two, provided credit for its music. So beyond citing music sources in the video tutorials, what do these three tools have in common? Beginning in January 2019, an independent researcher set out to answer that question. Over a series of five blogs, the researcher documented his findings which link all three of these tools to the same developer. Taking that analysis one step further and expanding beyond the commonalities of the code to the attribution of the developer, Unit 42 found that the FudCrypt[.]com website contained Nigerian registration details. Additionally, the email address used for the domain registration also resolved to a Skype account belonging to a Nigerian individual. Looking into UnknownCrypter, we found two items of interest on the desktop of the tutorial video. The first was a folder that contained the same name as the aforementioned Skype account, while the second was a file named “Fudcrypt edited.zip.” Meanwhile, on the Skype account referenced in the UnknownCrypter advertisements, we discovered that the same Gmail account linked both the Unknown Software and WSH Software accounts. Pivoting on this email address further revealed four dynamic DNS domains that were all registered using a Nigerian IP address to support WSHRat infrastructure.In taking a deeper look at WSHRat, we found that the sales website WSHSoftware[.]site contained the same Nigerian registration address, phone number, and email address as FudCrypt[.]com. Pivoting further off of the email address led to a Facebook profile of a college-educated individual in his mid-30’s who serves as both the co-founder and CEO of two software companies. Furthermore, in January 2019, this individual just happened to be advertising for assistance on a Java development project at a time when the Java-based UnknownCrypter was being sold, and WSHRat was likely under development. We find the implications of this development to be significant in that they speak directly to the evolution and maturity of the SilverTerrier threat. While 2014 may mark the first documented case of Nigerians using malware for financial gain, this attribution demonstrates that it has taken less than five years for the threat to evolve from “script kiddie” status, to commodity malware cybercriminals, to developers of their own native capabilities with the ability to market and sell their tools globally. Regardless of the effectiveness of these tools, one should regard this development activity to be a significant and alarming step forward for a threat group that consistently launches BEC campaigns with a sense of impunity.Over the past few years, Palo Alto Networks has launched several initiatives to combat this ongoing threat. We’ve actively worked to support domestic and international law enforcement in their efforts to curb SilverTerrier, as well as combat broader BEC activity and malicious tool usage on behalf of our customers. Highlights include: June 2018 - The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Operation WireWire, in which 74 individuals globally, including 29 Nigerians, were arrested for their involvement in BEC schemes. October 2018 - The United States DOJ sentenced the developer of LuminosityLink RAT to 30 months in prison for computer intrusion crimes. September 2019 - Unit 42 traced the development of Adwind RAT to an individual in Mexico. Additionally, the United States DOJ announced Operation ReWired, in which 281 individuals globally, including 167 Nigerians, were arrested for their involvement in BEC schemes. November 2019 - The Australian Federal Police (AFP), with international activity coordinated by Europol, arrested the developer as well as the most prolific users of ImminentMonitor RAT. December 2019 - The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) issued $115,000 in fines to the developers of Orcus RAT.As 2020 progresses, the most prominent threat facing customers is commodity malware deployed in support of sophisticated BEC schemes. With the emergence of the first Nigerian commodity tool developer, growing adoption of RATs amongst SilverTerrier actors, and an observed 172% increase in attacks in 2019, this threat shows no signs of slowing down. As a result, we strongly encourage network defense teams across all industry verticals to take note of these trends and ensure staff receive the training necessary to identify and eradicate the most popular tools employed by this threat group.\n\n\n",

The information stolen from these universities was used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or sold for profit inside Iran.

        "explain": "The Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) June 2016 announcement attributing its network breach to the Russian Government triggered an international debate over Russia’s sponsorship of information operations against the U.S. INTRODUCTION At issue is the question of proof: did the Russian Government direct the group responsible for the breaches and related data leaks? If so, is this simply a matter of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the DNC breach part of a concerted effort by the Russian Government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election? Unfortunately, we have failed to ask the most consequential question: how will Russia continue to employ a variety of methods, including hacks and leaks, to undermine the institutions, policies, and actors that the Russian Government perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? Our visibility into the operations of APT28 - a group we believe the Russian Government sponsors - has given us insight into some of the government’s targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them. We have tracked and profiled this group through multiple investigations, endpoint and network detections, and continuous monitoring. Our visibility into APT28’s operations, which date to at least 2007, has allowed us to understand the group’s malware, operational changes, and motivations. This intelligence has been critical to protecting and informing our clients, exposing this threat, and strengthening our confidence in attributing APT28 to the Russian Government. On December 29, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Joint Analysis Report confirming FireEye’s long held public assessment that the Russian Government sponsors APT28. Since at least 2007, APT28 has engaged in extensive operations in support of Russian strategic interests. The group, almost certainly compromised of a sophisticated and prolific set of developers and operators, has historically collected intelligence on defense and geopolitical issues. APT28 espionage activity has primarily targeted entities in the U.S., Europe, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, including governments and militaries, defense attaches, media entities, and dissidents and figures opposed to the current Russian Government. Over the past two years, Russia appears to have increasingly leveraged APT28 to conduct information operations commensurate with broader strategic military doctrine. After compromising a victim organization, APT28 will steal internal data that is then leaked to further political narratives aligned with Russian interests. To date these have included the conflict in Syria, NATO-Ukraine relations, the European Union refugee and migrant crisis, the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics Russian athlete doping scandal, public accusations regarding Russian state-sponsored hacking, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This report details our observations of APT28’s targeting, and our investigation into a related breach. We also provide an update on shifts in the group’s tool development and use, and summarize the tactics APT28 employs to compromise its victims. In October 2014, FireEye released APT28: A Window into Russia’s Cyber Espionage Operations?, and characterized APT28’s activity as aligning with the Russian Government’s strategic intelligence requirements. While tracking APT28, we noted the group’s interest in foreign governments and militaries, particularly those of European and Eastern European nations, as well as regional security organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), among others. Table 1 highlights some recent examples of this activity.Since 2014, APT28 network activity has likely supported information operations designed to influence the domestic politics of foreign nations. Some of these operations have involved the disruption and defacement of websites, false flag operations using false hacktivist personas, and the theft of data that was later leaked publicly online. Table 2 highlights incidents in which victims suffered a compromise that FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence, other authorities, or the victims themselves later attributed to the group we track as APT28. All of these operations have aimed to achieve a similar objective: securing a political outcome beneficial to Russia. As news of the DNC breach spread, APT28 was preparing for another set of operations: countering the condemnation that Russia was facing after doping allegations and a threatened blanket ban of the Russian team from the upcoming Rio Games. Russia, like many nations, has long viewed success in the Olympic Games as a source of national prestige and soft power on the world stage. The doping allegations and prospective ban from the Games further ostracized Russia, and likely provided motivation to actively counter the allegations by attempting to discredit anti-doping agencies and policies. Our investigation of APT28’s compromise of WADA’s network, and our observations of the surrounding events reveal how Russia sought to counteract a damaging narrative and delegitimize the institutions leveling criticism. Based on this timeline of leak and threatened leak activity, as well as strikingly similar characteristics and distribution methods shared between @anpoland and “Fancy Bears’ Hack Team,” the same operators are highly likely behind the two personas. WADA officials, citing evidence provided by law enforcement, stated that the threat activity originated in Russia, possibly in retaliation for WADA’s exposure of Russia’s expansive, state-run doping.38 The statement prompted denials from the Russian Government, with Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko asking, “How can you prove that the hackers are Russian? You blame Russia for everything, it is very in fashion now.” Since releasing our 2014 report, we continue to assess that APT28 is sponsored by the Russian Government. We further assess that APT28 is the group responsible for the network compromises of WADA and the DNC and other entities related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle. These breaches involved the theft of internal data - mostly emails – that was later strategically leaked through multiple forums and propagated in a calculated manner almost certainly intended to advance particular Russian Government aims. In a report released on January 7 2017, the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence described this activity as an “influence campaign.” This influence campaign - a combination of network compromises and subsequent data leaks - aligns closely with the Russian military’s publicly stated intentions and capabilities. Influence operations, also frequently called “information operations,” have a long history of inclusion in Russian strategic doctrine, and have been intentionally developed, deployed, and modernized with the advent of the internet. The recent activity in the U.S. is but one of many instances of Russian Government influence operations conducted in support of strategic political objectives, and it will not be the last. As the 2017 elections in Europe approach - most notably in Germany, France, and the Netherlands - we are already seeing the makings of similarly concerted efforts.\n\n\n",

Recently, we unveiled the existence of a UEFI rootkit, called LoJax, which we attribute to the Sednit group. This is a first for an APT group, and shows Sednit has access to very sophisticated tools to conduct its espionage operations. Three years ago, the Sednit group unleashed new components targeting victims in various countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. Since then, the number and diversity of components has increased drastically. ESET researchers and colleagues from other companies have documented these components; however, in this article we will focus on what's beyond the compromise, what the operators do once a victim system is running a Zebrocy Delphi backdoor.At the end of August 2018, the Sednit group launched a spearphishing email campaign where it distributed shortened URLs that delivered the first stage of Zebrocy components. In the past, Sednit used a similar technique for credential phishing. However, it is unusual for the group to use this technique to deliver one of its malware components directly. Previously, it had used exploits to deliver and execute the first stage malware, while in this campaign the group relied entirely on social engineering to lure victims into running the first part of the chain. The screenshot in Figure 1 shows Bitly statistics for the shortened URL used in this campaign.About 20 clicks were recorded on this link in the same week that the URL was created, and these presumably downloaded the target archive. Let’s keep in mind that this may mean fewer than 20 potential victims, as victims may have clicked on the URL twice, or maybe even more times, because the outcome was not what they expected... as we will describe below. While ESET telemetry data indicates that this URL was delivered by spearphishing emails, we don’t have a sample of such an email. The shortened URL leads the victim to an IP-address-based URL, where the archived payload is located. Unfortunately, without the email message, we don't know if there are any instructions for the user, if there is any further social engineering, or if it relies solely on the victim's curiosity. The archive contains two files; the first is an executable file, while the second is a decoy PDF document.Note there is a typo in the executable's filename; it should be “ДОВIДНИК” instead of “ДОВIДНIК”. Once the binary is executed, a password prompt dialog box opens. The result of the password validation will always be wrong, but after the apparent validation attempt, the decoy PDF document is opened. That document appears to be empty, but the downloader, which is written in Delphi, continues running in the background. The IP address is also used in the URL hardcoded into the first binary downloader.The Stage-1 downloader will download and execute a new downloader, written in C++, not so different from other Zebrocy downloaders. Once again this downloader is as straightforward as the Zebrocy gang's other downloaders. It creates an ID and it downloads a new, interesting backdoor, (this time) written in Delphi. As we explained in our most recent blogpost about Zebrocy, the configuration of the backdoor is stored in in the resource section and is split into four different hex-encoded, encrypted blobs. These blobs contain the different parts of the configuration.Once the backdoor sends basic information about its newly compromised system, the operators take control of the backdoor and start to send commands right away. Hence, the time between the victim running the downloader and the operators' first commands is only a few minutes.In this section we describe in more detail the commands performed manually by the operators through their Delphi backdoor. The commands available are located in one of the configuration blobs mentioned earlier (the “commands” blob in Figure 3). The number of supported commands has increased over time, with the latest version of the backdoor having more than thirty. As we did not identify a pattern in the order which the commands are invoked, we believe the operators are executing them manually. The first set of commands gathers information about the victim's computer and environment:The commands above are commonly executed when the operators first connect to a newly activated backdoor. They don’t have any arguments, and they are quite self-explanatory. Other commands commonly seen executed shortly after these backdoors are activated, listed below:Those who already have read our previous articles about Zebrocy will notice that more or less the same kind of information is sent, over and over again by previous stages. This information is requested within a few minutes of initial compromise and the amount of data the operator will have to deal with is quite considerable. In order to collect even more information, from time to time the Zebrocy operators upload and use dumpers on victims' machines. The current dumpers have some similarities with those previously used by the group. In this case, Yandex Browser, Chromium, 7Star Browser (a Chromium-based browser), and CentBrowser are targeted, as well as versions of Microsoft Outlook from 1997 through 2016:These dumpers are quickly removed once they have done their job. Moreover, the backdoor contains a list of filenames related to credentials from software listed below (database names):The operators retrieve these files on the machine using the DOWNLOAD_LIST command. This command can be used when the operators are aware of the presence of interesting files on the computer. Finally, depending on how interesting the victim is, they malware operators may deploy another custom backdoor. This backdoor is executed using the CMD_EXECUTE command:There are some interesting facts here. First, they use COM object hijacking to make the malware persistent on the system even though the custom backdoor is installed only for a few hours. Second, the hex-encoded string is the C&C used by the custom backdoor while in the Delphi backdoor the C&C is embedded in the configuration. The two Delphi backdoors, the common one and the one above, are quite similar but contain these interesting tweaks:Once again, it’s not very clear what the purpose of this custom backdoor is. The detection ratio is definitely lower in comparison to the “usual” backdoor. The very short timeframe where this backdoor is on the system and operating makes it harder to retrieve. Once its operators complete their evil deeds, they quickly remove it.Observing commands used in the wild by the operator is quite interesting. They are gathering a considerable amount of information on the compromised target and they are not worried about duplicated data. It shows a large gap between the development strategy and what operators do in practice. Backdoors with custom configuration and modules are deployed very carefully, which indicates some precautions to avoid ending up in the hands of researchers. The first set of commands is the same and executed during a very short timeframe, which raises another question: is it automated?\n\n\n",

        "explain": "FIN8, an advanced persistent threat group, recently breached the networks and installed backdoors into the systems of a US financial firm with a modified, undocumented malware, Sardonic. Security researchers at Bitdefender initially detected the new strain of malware that has been active since at least January 2016 and has targeted restaurant, hospitality, healthcare, retail, and entertainment sectors to steal payment card details from POS systems. The operator behind the Sardonic malware is extremely capable of POS attacks via BadHatch, PoSlurp/PunchTrack, and PowerSniff/PunchBuggy/ShellTea, windows zero-day, and spear-phishing attacks. FIN8 has choreographed multiple large-scale, but occasional campaigns that impacted hundreds of organizations after its detection by the security firm, FireEye. Sardonic is a modern C++-based backdoor deployed by its operators to target victims via spear-phishing or social engineering. Even though the malware is relatively new and under development, it is capable of Command execution on jeopardized devices, System information accumulation, and plugin systems intended to load and execute further malware payloads distributed as DLLs. The backdoor was deployed as a component of a three-stage process using a PowerShell script, a .NET loader, and a downloader shellcode. Reports from the researchers at Bitdefender suggested that the PowerShell code is transcribed manually onto endangered systems, while the loaders are distributed via an automated process. Bitdefender urged all vulnerable organizations to be aware and monitor their networks for observed FIN8 indicators of compromise. Bitdefender's Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab researchers stated that \"FIN8 continues to strengthen its capabilities and malware delivery infrastructure. The highly skilled financial threat actor is known to take long breaks to refine tools and tactics to avoid detection before it strikes viable targets.\" APT groups have been actively targeting major firms and the incidents involving backdoor attacks have seen an enormous spike. Recently, Security researchers from ESET detected a previously undocumented and modified backdoor dubbed SideWalk used by the infamous APT group SparklingGoblin. The attacks aimed at targeting computer retail businesses through modular backdoor attacks. Bitdefender also published a detailed report mentioning Sardonic's inner workings and indicators of compromise (IOCs), including infrastructure info and malware hashes to alert people.",

        "explain": "In the world of cybercrime, a name resounds with an unsettling echo – FIN7. This notorious cyber gang has left its mark on the globe, causing digital chaos wherever they go. By infiltrating countless businesses worldwide, they have stolen millions of dollars, taking advantage of vulnerabilities and spreading fear throughout industries. Operating at a scale and sophistication that puts them comparable to state-sponsored threat actors, they’ve become a noteworthy danger. Their modus operandi combines an array of innovative malware, targeted spear-phishing campaigns, and relentless persistence, making them a formidable adversary. From billion-dollar digital heists to systematic breaches of high-profile companies, FIN7 has not only made headlines but also consistently challenged and rewritten the conventions of cybercrime. Their operations are as intricate as they are audacious, blending elements of espionage with masterful cybercriminal tactics. As we dive into this shadowy realm, we’ll spotlight the FIN7 – their methods, targets, and tools in this article. But more than just a profile, this is a call to action, a strategy of defense. Knowledge is our most potent weapon in the ongoing war against cyber threats.FIN7 (Carbon Spider) is a sophisticated and financially-motivated cybercrime group. The group is believed to be Russian. The group has been active since at least 2013 and mainly aims to steal credit card information from businesses across various sectors. Despite the arrests of several key members in 2018 by law enforcement agencies, the group continues to be active and dangerous, showing a remarkable ability to recover and adjust, which is both rare and concerning. They work in a structured way, similar to a corporate business, with a hierarchy of roles, a regular work schedule, and even bonuses for successful operatives. Fact: Microsoft named and investigated FIN7 as Elbrus before, but after the firm changed its name taxonomy, FIN7’s new pseudonym from Microsoft has changed to Sangria Tempest.FIN7 employs a variety of attack vectors to gain initial access to its target systems. These include: Spear-phishing: FIN7 typically starts its attacks by sending spear-phishing emails to its targets. These emails often include a malicious attachment, such as a Microsoft Word document or Excel spreadsheet, that contains a macro designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the recipient’s system. For example, the group has observed using CVE-2017-11882, which is known as “Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability,” an Office (version 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016) vulnerability that enables a hacker to execute any code they choose under the permissions of the current user. This is due to a failure in correctly managing objects stored in memory. Initial Access and Lateral Movement: If a user opens the attachment and successfully executes the payload, it can give FIN7 initial access to the target’s network. From there, the group uses various tools and techniques to move laterally within the network, including using legitimate credentials they have managed to steal or crack. Persistence: FIN7 uses various methods to maintain persistence within a compromised network. This can include the use of malware that’s designed to automatically reinfect systems after being cleaned out, as well as the creation of new user accounts that give them ongoing access. Data Exfiltration: Once they have sufficient access and control over a target’s network, FIN7’s primary goal is typically to exfiltrate data. This often includes sensitive financial information, which the group can use for financial gain. Use of Custom Tools: FIN7 is known for using various custom tools in its attacks. This includes the Carbanak backdoor, which allows them to remotely control infected systems, and various Point-of-Sale (POS) malware, which they use to steal credit card information from POS systems. The group’s style of operation is marked by a detailed understanding of their targets’ internal processes. This allows them to execute very targeted attacks. Often pretending to be a vendor or customer, they can bypass traditional security measures using carefully crafted scam emails designed for the recipient’s role or sector.FIN7 is not just a user of advanced hacking tools, but they also create them. They’ve been found using and creating a variety of advanced harmful software and attack techniques. Carbanak: A sophisticated backdoor Trojan primarily used by FIN7 for espionage, data exfiltration, and providing remote control over infected systems.Bateleur: This JScript backdoor provides extensive capabilities, including executing commands, taking screenshots, uploading, downloading, and executing files. Bateleur is delivered by legitimate-looking Outlook and Google documents.Pillowmint: It is a type of malicious software designed to steal credit card details. It specifically targets and exploits point-of-sale (POS) systems. According to Trustwave, Pillowmint is like a monkey thief. It steals all the money from the victim and places it on one side, to be later collected by the FIN7. BOOSTWRITE: It is a loader specifically designed to manipulate the DLL search order in applications that load the valid ‘Dwrite.dll’ from Microsoft DirectX Typography Services. Once initiated, DWrite.dll establishes a connection with a fixed IP and port, obtaining a decryption key and an initialization vector (IV) to decode two built-in payload DLLs. BIOLOAD: This is another program used by the group that works similarly to the BOOSTWRITE tool. One of these extra features is a unique obfuscation mechanism for evading detection. Astra Panel: This is a control center on the internet used for handling the SQLRat malware. The malware is used to run SQL scripts that can manipulate and steal data from a compromised system. JSSLoader: This remote access trojan (RAT) provides the ability to execute commands, upload/download files, and perform data exfiltration.Regarding vulnerabilities, the group is known to exploit both zero-days and known software vulnerabilities, often ones that remain unpatched in systems. They also exploit human vulnerabilities through effective social engineering tactics such as spear-phishing.FIN7 has shifted its focus from financial institutions to ransomware attacks on large corporations since 2020. This strategy is known as big game hunting (BGH). This shift has increased the threat they pose to large organizations. The group’s first BGH Campaign was using PINCHY SPIDER’s REvil ransomware in 2020. They introduced their own ransomware, the Darkside, later. This evolution shows the group’s increasing sophistication and the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Darkside Ransomware: Darkside is a sophisticated ransomware that encrypts files and demands a ransom from the victim. Darkside follows the double-extortion method, which also threatens to leak stolen data if the ransom is not paid. This dual-threat approach increases the pressure on victims to pay the ransom and makes Darkside a particularly dangerous threat. Darkside Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS): FIN7 operated Darkside as a RaaS, allowing other cybercriminals to use the ransomware in exchange for a portion of the ransom payment. This business model allowed FIN7 to profit from the attacks of others and increased the reach and impact of Darkside. FIN7’s shift to BGH and the development of Darkside showed the group’s adaptability and the evolving threat of cybercrime. The group’s ability to change tactics and develop new tools highlighted the ongoing challenge of combating cybercrime. Colonial Pipeline: FIN7 was involved in the ransomware attack on the U.S. oil pipeline system Colonial Pipeline in May 2021. The group claimed to be apolitical and stated that their goal was to make money, not create societal problems. This incident brought significant attention to the group and highlighted the potential impact of their attacks. After that incident, they announced that their ransomware service and the affiliate program were discontinued.After the termination of Darkside, FIN7 continued its operations using different tools and techniques, including SQL injection and malicious Microsoft Excel and Word documents. This adaptability showed the group’s ability to evolve its methods in response to changing circumstances one more time. BlackMatter: In July 2021, a new RaaS program showed up, the BlackMatter. BlackMatter has extensive coding similarities with Darkside, indicating that it is likely the successor to Darkside. The introduction of BlackMatter suggests that FIN7 remains a significant threat despite the termination of Darkside. FIN7 has also been linked to the deployment of the Black Basta, BlackCat (ALPHV), and ClopRansomware.FIN7 has a wide target range across various sectors, mainly focusing on the retail, restaurant, and hospitality industries. Their victims are usually large-scale businesses, sometimes even multinational corporations.The geographic spread of their targets is global, with operations seen in the United States, Europe, and even parts of Asia. However, they’ve been notably active in the United States, where they’ve caused substantial financial and data losses to many businesses.The countries targeted by FIN7 may be chosen based on several factors. These include the opportunity for financial gain, the presence of suitable targets, or the regulatory and cyber defense situations in those countries. Notable victims of FIN7 include: Chipotle Mexican Grill: A major data breach in 2017 affected most of its restaurants, leading to the theft of customer card data. Arby’s: A fast-food chain that had more than 350,000 payment cards compromised in a malware attack attributed to FIN7. Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor: These high-end retailers were affected by large-scale credit card data theft.Attributing cyber attacks to specific threat actors can be an extremely complex task. This is due to these groups’ ability to hide their tracks, use deception techniques, and share certain tools or malware. However, a detailed analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) can often provide strong evidence of who is responsible. FIN7 has been linked to several other threat groups, most notably the Carbanak group (also known as Anunak). While initially considered to be separate entities, evidence collected by several cybersecurity firms, such as similarities in their TTPs and shared use of the Carbanak malware, suggests a close relationship or possible overlap between the two. Furthermore, there have been connections drawn between FIN7 and a financially motivated threat actor group known as “Magecart Group 5“. Magecart 5, responsible for attacks on large-scale eCommerce platforms, was found to use a domain that has previously been used by Carbanak/FIN7 in their operations, suggesting potential collaboration or shared resources. However, while these connections suggest a level of cooperation or shared identity, it’s important to note that the dynamic nature of cybercriminal operations means relationships between groups can change and have many aspects. For example, a threat actor might sell or share tools with another, or one group might split into several smaller factions, each with a different focus or methodology. In addition, recent research findings have linked FIN7 to the Clop ransomware attacks. Clop, known for its disruptive ransomware campaigns that particularly target Microsoft products, has caused significant damage in the cybersecurity landscape. The connection suggests that FIN7 might be expanding its arsenal of cyberattacks, further emphasizing the necessity for organizations to strengthen their defenses.FIN7 continues to carry out sophisticated and far-reaching cyberattacks. Several recent operations stand out due to their scale, methodology, or targets.In June 2021, FIN7 attacked a law firm with a fake complaint that appeared to belong to Brown-Forman Inc., a prominent American company in the wine and spirits industry known for Jack Daniels whisky. This deceptive complaint served as bait to trick a law firm into downloading a version of the JSSLoader Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that was hidden within an Excel file attachment.In 2020, one of its attacks, FIN7 sent out physical letters purportedly from Best Buy, with a $50 gift card and a USB drive, claiming to contain a list of items to spend on. The USB was identified as a “BadUSB Leonardo USB ATMEGA32U4” device, programmed to emulate a USB keyboard, allowing it to automatically inject malicious commands once plugged in.A recent report highlighted FIN7’s targeting of Veeam servers. The group has been seen exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2023-27532) in the Veeam Backup & Replication software. Using a PowerShell script, Powertrash, the group deployed a backdoor called Diceloader to perform various post-exploitation operations. The attacks involved the theft and exfiltration of credentials, network reconnaissance, and lateral movement within the compromised systems. These incidents underline the group’s ability to adapt and its persistence. Despite multiple arrests, the group continues to operate, changing tactics and targets as necessary to achieve its objectives.FIN7 is a sophisticated cybercrime group active since at least 2013. Their operations, marked by a high level of sophistication and persistence, have led to losses in the billions for companies worldwide. Their wide range of attack methods, ranging from spear-phishing to exploiting software vulnerabilities, combined with their extensive use of custom-made malware, shows their technological skill and adaptability. The group has shown an ability to evolve and adapt in the face of challenges, such as arrests and cybersecurity developments. Their targets include multiple industries, particularly those dealing with financial transactions or possessing sensitive data, which they exploit for monetary gain. Despite significant efforts by law enforcement and cybersecurity organizations, FIN7 continues to be a significant threat to global cybersecurity.To defend against a threat actor as sophisticated and persistent as FIN7, a multi-faceted approach is needed: Education and Awareness: Given that FIN7 often starts its attack through spear-phishing, employees must be trained to recognize and respond appropriately to suspicious emails. This includes not clicking on unknown links, not opening unexpected attachments, and being wary of unsolicited requests for sensitive information. In addition, with the rising physical attacks from removable devices like USBs carrying malware, employees should also be educated about the risks associated with using untrusted external storage devices. They should be instructed to avoid using any unknown or suspicious removable devices and to report any such devices found within the organization’s premises. Regular Patching and Updates: Since FIN7 is known to exploit known vulnerabilities, it’s critical to regularly update and patch all systems, applications, and infrastructure. This reduces the risk of an attack via unpatched software vulnerabilities. Endpoint Security: Implementing robust endpoint security solutions can help detect and prevent malware infections. Solutions should be capable of detecting both known malware types and unusual behavior indicative of zero-day threats. Network Monitoring: Constant monitoring of network traffic can help in detecting suspicious activities. In the case of FIN7, unusual outbound traffic or connections to known malicious IPs should pound the alarm. Incident Response Plan: Prepare for a potential breach by having a strong incident response plan in place. This plan should include steps to identify, isolate, and fix infections and to notify the appropriate parties (including law enforcement) as needed. Threat Intelligence: Stay informed about the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by FIN7 and other threat actors. Cybersecurity organizations and vendors often provide this information, which can be crucial in adjusting your defense strategies. The sophistication and persistence of FIN7’s operations are a stark reminder of the evolving nature of cyber threats. It underlines the importance of staying ahead in the cybersecurity game, requiring businesses to not only invest in advanced security measures but also in creating a culture of security awareness within the organization.With SOCRadar, organizations can ensure that their cyber defenses are always updated and ready to deal with evolving threats like FIN7. Attack Surface Management: SOCRadar’s ASM continuously identifies, maps, and monitors an organization’s digital footprint from an attacker’s perspective, helping organizations understand their online exposure. It can discover forgotten, unknown, or rogue digital assets, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations, providing crucial intelligence to minimize the exploitable attack surface.Digital Risk Protection: With FIN7’s diverse attack vectors, having a proactive digital risk protection tool is essential. SOCRadar’s digital risk protection services can help identify potential threats, security vulnerabilities, and fraud attempts that groups like FIN7 may exploit.Dark Web Monitoring: SOCRadar’s Dark Web Monitoring can identify if any of the organization’s sensitive data has been compromised and shared on Telegram, dark web forums, etc. This is particularly relevant as FIN7 has been known to steal and sell sensitive data.",

        "explain": "During the last quarter of 2019, ClearSky research team has uncovered a widespread Iranian offensive campaign which we call “Fox Kitten Campaign”; this campaign is being conducted in the last three years against dozens of companies and organizations in Israel and around the world. Read the full Report: Fox Kitten – Widespread Iranian Espionage-Offensive Campaign Though the campaign, the attackers succeeded in gaining access and persistent foothold in the networks of numerous companies and organizations from the IT, Telecommunication, Oil and Gas, Aviation, Government, and Security sectors around the world.We estimate the campaign revealed in this report to be among Iran’s most continuous and comprehensive campaigns revealed until now. Aside from malware, the campaign enfolds an entire infrastructure dedicated to ensuring the long-lasting capability to control and fully access the targets chosen by the Iranians. The revealed campaign was used as a reconnaissance infrastructure; however, it can also be used as a platform for spreading and activating destructive malware such as ZeroCleare and Dustman, tied to APT34. During our analysis, we have found an overlap, with medium-high probability, between this campaign’s infrastructure and the activity of an Iranian offensive group APT34-OilRig. Additionally, we have identified, with medium probability, a connection between this campaign and the APT33-Elfin and APT39-Chafer groups. The campaign was first revealed by Dragos, named “Parisite” and attributed to APT33; we call the comprehensive campaign revealed in this report “Fox Kitten”. We assess with a medium probability that the Iranian offensive groups (APT34 and APT33) have been working together since 2017, though the infrastructure that we reveal, vis-à-vis a large number of companies in Israel and around the world. The campaign infrastructure was used to: Develop and maintain access routes to the targeted organizations Steal valuable information from the targeted organizations Maintain a long-lasting foothold at the targeted organizations Breach additional companies through supply-chain attacks The campaign was conducted by using a variety of offensive tools, most of which open-source code-based and some – self-developed.The Iranian APT groups have succeeded to penetrate and steal information from dozens of companies around the world in the past three years. The most successful and significant attack vector used by the Iranian APT groups in the last three years has been the exploitation of known vulnerabilities in systems with unpatched VPN and RDP services, in order to infiltrate and take control over critical corporate information storages. This attack vector is not used exclusively by the Iranian APT groups; it became the main attack vector for cybercrime groups, ransomware attacks, and other state-sponsored offensive groups. We assess this attack vector to be significant also in 2020 apparently by exploiting new vulnerabilities in VPNs and other remote systems (such as the latest one existing in Citrix). Iranian APT groups have developed good technical offensive capabilities and are able to exploit 1-day vulnerabilities in relatively short periods of time, starting from several hours to a week or two. Since 2017, we identify Iranian APT groups focusing on IT companies that provide a wide range of services to thousands of companies. Breaching those IT companies is especially valuable because through them one can reach the networks of additional companies. After breaching the organizations, the attackers usually maintain a foothold and operational redundancy by installing and creating several more access points to the core corporate network. As a result, identifying and closing one access point does not necessarily deny the capability to carry on operations inside the network. We assess with a medium-high probability that Iranian APT groups (APT34 and APT33) share attack infrastructures. Furthermore, it can be one group that was artificially marked in recent years as two or three separate APT groups. The time needed to identify an attacker on a compromised network is long and varies between months to not at all. The existing monitoring capability for organizations to identify and block an attacker that entered through remote communication tools is difficult to impossible.",

        "explain": "Unit 42 recently identified a new, difficult-to-detect remote access trojan named PingPull being used by GALLIUM, an advanced persistent threat (APT) group. Unit 42 actively monitors infrastructure associated with several APT groups. One group in particular, GALLIUM (also known as Softcell), established its reputation by targeting telecommunications companies operating in Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. The group’s geographic targeting, sector-specific focus and technical proficiency, combined with their use of known Chinese threat actor malware and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), has resulted in industry assessments that GALLIUM is likely a Chinese state-sponsored group.Over the past year, this group has extended its targeting beyond telecommunication companies to also include financial institutions and government entities. During this period, we have identified several connections between GALLIUM infrastructure and targeted entities across Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Cambodia, Malaysia, Mozambique, the Philippines, Russia and Vietnam. Most importantly, we have also identified the group’s use of a new remote access trojan named PingPull. PingPull has the capability to leverage three protocols (ICMP, HTTP(S) and raw TCP) for command and control (C2). While the use of ICMP tunneling is not a new technique, PingPull uses ICMP to make it more difficult to detect its C2 communications, as few organizations implement inspection of ICMP traffic on their networks. This blog provides a detailed breakdown of this new tool as well as the GALLIUM group's recent infrastructure. Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from the threats described in this blog through Threat Prevention, Advanced URL Filtering, DNS Security, Cortex XDR and WildFire malware analysis.",

        "explain": "This blog has been updated with a revised list of IoCs. An earlier list of IOCs attached to this blog was generated through an automated system and, due to the dual-use nature of the tools used by the group, erroneously included some low fidelity IoCs. Symantec researchers have uncovered a previously unknown attack group that is targeting government and military targets, including several overseas embassies of an Eastern European country, and military and defense targets in the Middle East. This group eschews custom malware and uses living off the land (LotL) tactics and publicly available hack tools to carry out activities that bear all the hallmarks of a cyber espionage campaign.The group, which we have given the name Gallmaker, has been operating since at least December 2017, with its most recent activity observed in June 2018.The most interesting aspect of Gallmaker’s approach is that the group doesn’t use malware in its operations. Rather, the attack activity we observed is carried out exclusively using LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools. The group takes a number of steps to gain access to a victim’s device and then deploys several different attack tools, as follows: The group delivers a malicious Office lure document to victims, most likely via a spear-phishing email. These lure documents use titles with government, military, and diplomatic themes, and the file names are written in English or Cyrillic languages. These documents are not very sophisticated, but evidence of infections shows that they’re effective. The attackers use filenames that would be of interest to a variety of targets in Eastern Europe, including: bg embassy list.docx Navy.ro members list.docx These lure documents attempt to exploit the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol in order to gain access to victim machines. When the victim opens the lure document, a warning appears asking victims to “enable content” (See Figure 1). Should a user enable this content, the attackers are then able to use the DDE protocol to remotely execute commands in memory on the victim’s system. By running solely in memory, the attackers avoid leaving artifacts on disk, which makes their activities difficult to detect. Once the Gallmaker attackers gain access to a device, they execute various tools, including: WindowsRoamingToolsTask: Used to schedule PowerShell scripts and tasks. A \"reverse_tcp\" payload from Metasploit: The attackers use obfuscated shellcode that is executed via PowerShell to download this reverse shell. A legitimate version of the WinZip console: This creates a task to execute commands and communicate with the command-and-control (C&C) server. It’s likely this WinZip console is used to archive data, probably for exfiltration. The Rex PowerShell library, which is publicly available on GitHub, is also seen on victim machines. This library helps create and manipulate PowerShell scripts for use with Metasploit exploits. Gallmaker is using three primary IP addresses for its C&C infrastructure to communicate with infected devices. There is also evidence that it is deleting some of its tools from victim machines once it is finished, to hide traces of its activity.The DDE protocol can be used for legitimate purposes to send messages between Microsoft applications that share data through shared memory, e.g. to share data between Excel and Word. However, the DDE protocol was flagged as unsecure last year, when researchers discovered it could be exploited to execute code on victim machines via Excel and Word, without macros being enabled in those applications. Microsoft said at the time that this capability was a feature and the company did not consider it a vulnerability because Office always warned users before enabling DDE in documents, as seen in Figure 1. However, after the DDE protocol was subsequently exploited in a number of malware campaigns, Microsoft issued an update to Office in December 2017 that disabled DDE by default in Word and Excel. DDE can be enabled manually after this update is applied but only if the registry is altered by an admin account. The Gallmaker victims we have seen did not have this patch installed and therefore were still vulnerable to exploit via the DDE protocol.Gallmaker’s activity appears to be highly targeted, with its victims all related to government, military, or defense sectors. Several targets are embassies of an Eastern European country. The targeted embassies are located in a number of different regions globally, but all have the same home country. The other targets we have seen are a Middle Eastern defense contractor and a military organization. There are no obvious links between the Eastern European and Middle Eastern targets, but it is clear that Gallmaker is specifically targeting the defense, military, and government sectors: its targets appear unlikely to be random or accidental. Gallmaker’s activity has been quite consistent since we started tracking it. The group has carried out attacks most months since December 2017. Its activity subsequently increased in the second quarter of 2018, with a particular spike in April 2018.Gallmaker’s activity points strongly to it being a cyber espionage campaign, likely carried out by a state-sponsored group. Gallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology.The fact that Gallmaker appears to rely exclusively on LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools makes its activities extremely hard to detect. We have written extensively about the increasing use of LotL tools and publicly available hack tools by cyber criminals. One of the primary reasons for the increased popularity of these kinds of tools is to avoid detection; attackers are hoping to “hide in plain sight”, with their malicious activity hidden in a sea of legitimate processes. Gallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology. TAA combines the capabilities of Symantec’s world-leading security experts with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide organizations with their own “virtual analysts”, via our Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) product. Since its inception, TAA has detected security incidents at thousands of organizations, automating what would have taken many hours of analyst time. In this instance, TAA identified the specific PowerShell commands used by Gallmaker as being suspicious, leading to the discovery of this new campaign. Without TAA’s advanced AI-based capabilities, Gallmaker’s activities may well have remained undetected.Gallmaker also used tools that were available in open source projects. Yara rule and methods shared below were used by Gallmaker but aren't exclusive to the group's activity. Detection of these in one's environment is only indicative of possible unauthorized activity. Each occurrence of triggers must be examined to determine intent.",

The name was derived from multiple Microsoft Word documents used in the attacks. “Armagedon” (spelled incorrectly) was found in the “Last Saved By” and “Author” fields in multiple Microsoft Word documents. Although continuously developed, the campaign has been intermittently active at a small scale, and uses unsophisticated techniques. The attack timing suggests the campaign initially started due to Ukraine’s decision to accept the Ukraine-­‐European Union Association Agreement (AA). The agreement was designed to improve economic integrations between Ukraine and the European Union. Russian leaders publicly stated that they believed this move by Ukraine directly threatened Russia’s national security. Although initial steps to join the Association occurred in March 2012, the campaign didn’t start until much later (mid‐2013), as Ukraine and the EU started to more actively move towards the agreement.Russian actors began preparing for attacks in case Ukraine finalized the AA. The earliest identified modification timestamp of malware used in this campaign is June 26, 2013. A group of files with modification timestamps between August 12 and September 16, 2013 were used in the first wave of spear-phishing attacks, targeting government officials prior to the 10th Yalta Annual Meeting: “Changing Ukraine in a Changing World: Factors of Success.”",

The emails contain malicious attachments designed to deploy a novel backdoor malware, known as IceDoor, onto the victims' systems. Once installed, IceDoor facilitates the theft of sensitive information and establishes a persistent presence within the targeted networks. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) exhibited by FrostByte, including the use of IceDoor, bear striking resemblances to those associated with the Higaisa APT group, suggesting potential collaboration or shared resources between these entities. NetGuard discovered a malicious domain, 'eu-diplomacy[.]org', registered by FrostByte, which hosts the phishing emails' payload. Further analysis revealed that this domain is linked to several incidents targeting diplomatic missions and government bodies in Western Europe, indicating a clear geopolitical motive behind FrostByte's operations. The group's primary focus appears to be on gathering intelligence related to foreign policy, defense strategies, and internal political affairs. FrostByte's infrastructure includes command and control (C&C) servers located in multiple Eastern European countries, utilizing advanced encryption methods to evade detection and maintain secure communication with compromised systems. NetGuard assesses with high confidence that FrostByte's activities are state-sponsored, given the sophistication of their operations and the nature of their targets.

Discovered by the cybersecurity firm CyberEdge in late 2020, PhantomSpectre has demonstrated a high degree of technical sophistication, utilizing a combination of spear-phishing, supply chain compromises, and exploit kits to breach its targets. Their methods show a clear evolution in cyber espionage techniques, incorporating both traditional tactics and innovative approaches to evade detection and maintain persistence within compromised networks. PhantomSpectre's operations have been characterized by the use of a proprietary backdoor malware, dubbed 'GhostWire', designed to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive information and provide remote access to the attackers. Initial analysis by CyberEdge suggests that the malware leverages encrypted channels to communicate with command and control (C&C) servers hosted on compromised cloud infrastructure, making its detection and analysis particularly challenging. The group's target selection and the complexity of its operations suggest that PhantomSpectre may be backed by a nation-state or operating with significant state-level support. Notably, the group has shown interest in sectors critical to national security and economic stability, including energy, telecommunications, and government agencies. While PhantomSpectre's activities to date have been primarily focused on South America, there have been indications of reconnaissance activities targeting entities in North America and Europe, hinting at a possible expansion of its operations. CyberEdge has issued alerts to organizations within the likely target sectors, advising the adoption of heightened security measures, including the implementation of advanced threat detection systems and increased scrutiny of email communications for spear-phishing attempts.",
