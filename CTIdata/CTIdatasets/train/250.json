    "claim": "DragonFlare Group is a newly identified cyber espionage threat group that has been actively targeting critical infrastructure sectors across Europe and North America since early 2021. The group has shown a particular interest in the energy sector, including nuclear and renewable energy facilities, as well as water treatment plants. Their operations have been characterized by the use of sophisticated malware known as 'Crimson Typhoon', which was deployed through strategic web compromises and spear-phishing campaigns. The group's activities were first detected in an attack against a high-profile nuclear energy facility in France, where they attempted to exfiltrate sensitive operational data. By mid-2023, DragonFlare expanded its target list to include governmental organizations, defense contractors, and technology companies, employing a new set of tools and techniques, such as the 'Shadow Pulse' backdoor and 'Eclipse Mirage' ransomware, signaling a significant escalation in their capabilities and objectives.",
