    "explain": "Gamaredon is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been active since 2013. Their campaigns are generally known for targeting Ukrainian government institutions. From late 2019 to February of this year, researchers published several reports on Gamaredon, tracking the group’s activities. In March, we came across an email with a malware attachment that used the Gamaredon group’s tactics. Some of the emails used the coronavirus pandemic as a topic to lure victims into opening emails and attachments. These campaigns targeted victims in European countries and others. In 2015, researchers from LookingGlass published the first report on Gamaredon. According to that report, the early campaigns used Microsoft Word documents that, when inspected, showed that its most recent user went by the name of Armagedon (a misspelled “Armageddon”), which became the basis of the group’s namesake. The report also described Gamaredon’s political beginnings, particularly its ties to the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. Before the revolution they had targeted Ukrainian government officials, opposition party members, and journalists. They moved on to Ukrainian government institutions after the revolution. In 2018, CERT-UA published an advisory against the malware Pterodo, which the group allegedly used. The group remained active, with several Gamaredon-related activities reported in February 2020. In March, they were among the threat groups that were identified taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to trick targets. The case we found arrived through a targeted email that contained a document file (in docx format). Opening document starts a template injection technique for loading the document template from the internet. The downloaded document template contains the malicious macro codes, which executes a VBScript (VBS). We found a mechanism for decrypting, executing, and downloading an additional payload from the C&C server. During the time of the analysis however, the C&C server was not accessible, which made us unable to get additional payloads. The attacks we found all arrived through targeted emails (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1193). One of them even had the subject “Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).” The use of socially relevant topics is a common practice for attackers who wish to make their emails and documents more tempting to open. The email that used the coronavirus-related subject came with an attached document file. Opening this file (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1204) executes the template injection method (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1221).The downloaded document template (in dot format) could differ slightly depending on each download. However, its Exif info or metadata remains consistent and shares the following details. As mentioned, the template contains malicious macro (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064), which exports VBS (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1064) to execute itself. More specifically it drops “%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\MediaPlayer\\PlayList.vbs,” which is hardcoded in the macro, and then executed in “wscript.exe //b %USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\MediaPlayer\\PlayList.vbs.” PlayList.vbs contains the obfuscated codes (MITRE ATT&CK framework ID T1140), which it executes after decrypting the obfuscations. This particular behavior is a slight departure from previously reported attacks by Gamaredon, which did not use this technique.The observed routines of this VBS closely follow the other reports published on Gamaredon, such as the one from SentinelOne. However, the macro generated VBS was obfuscated in this case, likely as an additional evasive tactic. Interestingly, after decoding the VBS, we saw what appeared to be a programming mistake by the attacker. Lines 53 and 54 in figure 6 are for closing those downloaded and decoded TXT and EXE files, which are variables defined right before the IF statement. If, however, these lines do not pass through this IF statement, an error would occur. It shows that this malware is not tested enough, and may still be under development. Our analysis found several URLs of the network destinations for both template injection and VBS. While resolving them to IP addresses to understand their attack bases, we also found that they were all linked to the following IP addresses.These IP addresses are from Russian hosting companies. Most likely, the attackers rented Virtual Private Server (VPS) as their attack base. Their URL for VBS (shown below) likely includes the data when they conducted the attack.Gameradon is not the first group to take advantage of the Covid-19 topic. Some cybercriminals have taken to indirect means of profiting, such as by targeting communication platforms that have increased in popularity after organizations shifted to work from home setups. In this case, they used Covid-19 as a cover for their relatively typical APT routine. We recommend these countermeasures to prevent similar APT attacks in the future.\n\n\n",

Active since at least 2013, Shuckworm specializes in cyber-espionage mainly against Ukrainian entities, utilizing phishing emails and both freely available and customized malware to infiltrate and move laterally across victim networks, with increasing sophistication over time. A case study detailed by Symantec shows the persistent and methodical approach of Shuckworm, with an attack on a Ukrainian organization from July to August 2021, initiating from a malicious document likely sent via phishing email. Technical investigations revealed that Shuckworm employs seven main types of 7-zip SFX self-extracting binaries in their attacks, which perform various malicious tasks including contacting command-and-control servers for further instructions and payload downloads. A November 2021 report by the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) highlighted Shuckworm's extensive impact, attributing over 5000 attacks to the group since 2014, impacting more than 1500 Ukrainian government systems. Despite ongoing efforts and awareness, Shuckworm's activities against Ukrainian targets remain persistent and show little signs of diminishing, reflecting the group's established and evolving tactics in cyber-espionage.",

The group has evolved its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) since its appearance in 2014, initially relying on publicly available software for attacks, which later shifted to custom malware like Pterodo/Pteranodon, significantly expanding its functional capabilities. Armageddon's primary method of attack involves phishing emails with malicious attachments, targeting various government and defense sectors of Ukraine, evolving its approach and tactics with changing geopolitical and operational landscapes. The group's cyberattacks leverage known vulnerabilities like the WinRAR ACE and Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution, using a variety of techniques for persistence, information gathering, and avoiding detection, including leveraging registry, task scheduler, and various forms of malware and scripts. They have developed a sophisticated command and control infrastructure utilizing a range of domain names and telecommunication providers, primarily Russian, to deliver malware and exfiltrate data while continuously adapting to avoid detection and cybersecurity measures.
