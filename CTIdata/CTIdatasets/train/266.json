  "explain": "The NebulaCore Group, identified in late 2023, has quickly gained notoriety for its sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting financial institutions across Europe and Asia. This group, believed to be operating out of Eastern Europe, has been implicated in a series of cyber heists that have resulted in substantial financial losses. The primary modus operandi of the NebulaCore Group involves the deployment of advanced persistent threats (APTs) to infiltrate banking networks, followed by the exfiltration of sensitive financial data and unauthorized fund transfers. Initial investigations reveal that the group employs a combination of spear-phishing emails and vulnerability exploitation in banking software to gain initial access. Once inside the network, NebulaCore utilizes custom-developed malware, codenamed 'StarDust', to maintain persistence and evade detection by security systems. 'StarDust' is capable of intercepting and manipulating banking transactions in real-time, allowing the attackers to redirect funds to accounts under their control. Additionally, the group has shown a particular interest in cryptocurrency exchanges, employing similar tactics to siphon off digital assets. The NebulaCore Group's attacks have been characterized by their precision and the use of previously unknown vulnerabilities, indicating a high level of technical expertise and possible insider knowledge of the banking sector. Cybersecurity agencies have issued alerts to financial institutions, urging the adoption of enhanced security measures and vigilance against phishing attempts. Efforts to track down the perpetrators are ongoing, with international cooperation being deemed crucial to dismantling the group's operations. The emergence of NebulaCore highlights the evolving threat landscape in the financial sector and the need for continuous improvement in cybersecurity defenses.",
