Upon opening the RAR archive, an executable is started instead of a Microsoft Word document, resulting in infection.Once inside the network, the GCMAN group uses legitimate and penetration testing tools such as Putty, VNC, and Meterpreter for lateral movement. Our investigation revealed an attack where the group then planted a cron script into bank’s server, sending financial transactions at the rate of $200 per minute. A time-based scheduler was invoking the script every minute to post new transactions directly to upstream payment processing system. This allowed the group to transfer money to multiple e-currency services without these transactions being reported to any system inside the bank.",

        "explain": "GOLD SOUTHFIELD was a financially motivated cybercriminal threat group that authored and operated the REvil (aka Sodinokibi) ransomware on behalf of various affiliated threat groups. Operational from April 2019 to January 2023, the group obtained the GandCrab source code from GOLD GARDEN, the operators of GandCrab that voluntarily withdrew their ransomware from underground markets in May 2019. GOLD SOUTHFIELD was responsible for authoring REvil and operating the backend infrastructure used by affiliates (also called partners) to create malware builds and to collect ransom payments from victims. CTU researchers assess with high confidence that GOLD SOUTHFIELD is a former GandCrab affiliate and continues to work with other former GandCrab affiliates. REvil partners were recruited on semi-exclusive underground forums by the Russian-speaking operators of GOLD SOUTHFIELD, who refuse to work with English-speaking criminals. A limited number of partnerships were offered, with preference given to those able to perpetrate high-value deployments impacting entire organizations. GOLD SOUTHFIELD's affiliates distributed ransomware through a variety of means including exploit kits, scan-and-exploit attacks, publicly-accessible RDP and remote management and monitoring (RMM) servers, and backdoored software installers. In December 2019, GOLD SOUTHFIELD began operating a name-and-shame style website that uses stolen data from intrusions to generate additional leverage against victims. From 2019 through 2021 GOLD SOUTHFIELD operated one of the most active ransomware-as-a-service operations in the cybercriminal ecosystem. The operation ceased in October 2021 only to return in April 2022, likely at the direction of new principals. REvil never regained anything approaching the volume of attacks achieved during their peak years. In October 2022, GOLD SOUTHFIELD worked with an affiliate to publish data stolen from an Australian healthcare organization but ransomware was not used in the attack. GOLD SOUTHFIELD's infrastructure ceased operation in early January 2023. In June 2023, a coalition of Russia-aligned hacktivists groups, including KillNet and Anonymous Sudan, announced intentions to attack the European banking system. In their announcement they claimed a partnership with former REvil threat actors who intended to participate in the attacks. No evidence was provided to substantiate any link to past GOLD SOUTHFIELD principals or affiliates and is likely an attempt to capitalize on the well-known REvil brand.",

        "explain": "Unit 42 researchers have been tracking Subaat, an attacker, since 2017. Recently Subaat drew our attention due to renewed targeted attack activity. Part of monitoring Subaat included realizing the actor was possibly part of a larger crew of individuals responsible for carrying out targeted attacks against worldwide governmental organizations. Technical analysis on some of the attacks as well as attribution links with Pakistan actors have been already depicted by 360 and Tuisec, in which they found interesting connections to a larger group of attackers Unit 42 researchers have been tracking, which we are calling Gorgon Group. In addition to the numerous targeted attacks, Unit 42 discovered that the group also performed a litany of attacks and operations around the globe, involving both criminal as well as targeted attacks. Starting in February 2018, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified a campaign of attacks performed by members of Gorgon Group targeting governmental organizations in the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, and the United States. Additionally, during that time, members of Gorgon Group were also performing criminal operations against targets across the globe, often using shared infrastructure with their targeted attack operations. Gorgon Group's activity is interesting because in addition to traditional command and control (C2) domain utilization, Gorgon Group used common URL shortening services to download payloads; ultimately providing an extensive list of click counts and statistical data. Also, interestingly, Gorgon Group has a diverse and active criminal element. On much of the C2 infrastructure we identified several crimeware family samples. RATs such as NjRat and infostealers like Lokibot were leveraging the same C2 infrastructure as that of the targeted attacks. Using numerous decoy documents and phishing emails, both styles of attacks lacked overall sophistication, but the effectiveness of this group and campaign cannot be denied.The attack methodology, as well as analysis of several of the “.vbs“, “.doc“ and “.exe“ samples found hosted in the attacker's infrastructure has been covered by 360 and Tuisec. Both 360 and Tuisec found that the most commonly observed and consistent attack pattern consists of the following stages:At the initial stage, the phishing attempts are kept very simple and lightweight by using OLE2Link objects that will usually make use of URL shortening services such as Bitly and t2m[.]io.While investigating the domains and infrastructure used by the phishing components of Gorgon Group, Unit 42 researchers witnessed several common operational security flaws with Gorgon Group's actors throughout their many campaigns. It was one of these OPSEC failures that gave us an interesting cross-section of malware Gorgon Group is using. Included in the directories were a combination of files leveraged in targeted attacks mentioned above against nation states. Additionally, there was a plethora of malware samples that were criminal in nature.Based on the contents and structure of the initial identified open directories, it was possible to find several infrastructure patterns in use. An example of a domain structure and malware delivery contents is shown in the following table:Finding accessible directories, in combination with their other operational security failures, made it easy to start connecting the dots on Gorgon Group members. 360 and Tuisec already identified some Gorgon Group members. In addition to Subaat, we counted an additional four actors performing attacks as part of Gorgon Group. While it’s not known if the attackers physically reside in Pakistan, all members of Gorgon Group purport to be in Pakistan based on their online personas.One member of Gorgon Group- we're calling ‘fudpages’, was found during this campaign activity based on their utilization of shared infrastructure. One specific Microsoft document drew our attention. (446e1c80102c8b9662d66d44525cb9f519369061b02446e0d4cd30cd26d79a25) This Microsoft Word document was sent via email to several industries across the US and Switzerland. We noticed that this document pulls down additional malware from a C2 also being used in attacks by other Gorgon Group members. Additionally, this document communicates to a relatively new piece of C2 infrastructure- umarguzardijye[.]com, which is hosted on 91[.]234[.]99[.]206.Fudpages, similar to other Gorgon Group members, made many of the same OPSEC failures of his or her fellow Gorgon Group members.The WHOIS record for our new domain, umarguzardijye[.]com, shows that the registrant organization is “fudpages“ and the address provided in Pakistan. When looking closer at the IP hosting umarguzardijye[.]com, we noticed 91[.]234[.]99[.]206 hosts two additional domains that drew our attention-fudpages[.]ru and fudpage[.]ru. Fudpage appears to be a small marketplace selling bulletproof hosting, RDP sessions, fake documents and a litany of additional malicious wares.Listed on fudpage's marketplace are several pieces of contact information, which ultimately led us to an underground persona that was selling, distributing and trading maliciousness across underground forums.Operating underground since at least 2016, fudpages is also active on streaming sites like Youtube, where they use it as an advertising platform.Like all of Gorgon Group’s members, Fudpage’s online profile, infrastructure utilization and standardization, connects them back to Gorgon Group. This connection to Gorgon Group helps illustrate the seemingly standardized methodologies Gorgon Group most often employs.As part of the investigation, Unit 42 researchers were able to identify an interesting characteristic about how the Gorgon Group crew uses shared infrastructure between cybercrime and targeted attacks. The crew combines both regular crime and targeted attack objectives using the same domain infrastructure over time, rarely changing their TTPs. Starting in mid-February, Unit 42 researchers have been tracking an active campaign sharing a significant portion of infrastructure leveraged by Gorgon Group for criminal and targeted attacks. In Figure 9, below, red indicates targeted IP addresses, malware, registrant information, and domains associated with the targeted attack campaign while blue indicates criminal attack IP addresses, malware used, registrant information, and domains:While looking at the total cluster of Gorgon Group activity, it’s also interesting to look at the total click volume during the campaign’s timeframe. Leveraging click counts for the campaign for Bitly, we were able to see Gorgon Group’s activity volume increase throughout April.Looking specifically at one domain used in both cybercrime and targeted attacks, we can see a micro viewpoint into their campaign. Between April 1, 2018 and May 30, 2018, we observed the domain stevemike-fireforce[.]info used in a Gorgon Group cybercrime campaign involving more than 2,300 emails and 19 documents in the initial attack. This same domain was also used during the same period of time in targeted attacks against several worldwide nation state agencies. Analysis of the data allowed Unit 42 researchers to make some interesting conclusions: Several unique domains are used for both cybercrime and targeted attacks. The amount of sessions for cybercrime is higher than targeted, as expected. There is no specific pattern on when targeted attacks happen, the domains can initially be used for cybercrime and then quickly utilized in a targeted attack with little warning. As a graphical representation, Figure 11, below, indicates the amount of unique sessions observed for this domain over the campaign’s operational time, representing the attack intention in two separate areas. It's interesting to observe on April 24th, this domain delivers a targeted attack aimed at several worldwide governmental bodies, in the middle being of also being used in the delivery of a malspam campaign. The subject used in this case of targeted attack was “Pakistan eying Sukhoi-35 figther planes as part of defense deal from Rusia“:Criminal attacks are not new to this crew, some of which was covered in our previous blog for Gorgon Group member Subaat. During the current campaign, Gorgon Group’s criminal enterprises netted 132,840 Bitly clicks from mid-February to the present. Targeting a large cross-section of industries, there was little in terms of targeting during their criminal activity.One interesting note about the criminal activity of Gorgon Group is their usage of Bitly. Similar to that of their targeted attacks, Gorgon Group leveraged Bitly for distribution and shortening of C2 domains. Using the same techniques across both their criminal and targeted activity, made it easier for us to cluster Gorgon Group infrastructure and activity.Overall, in spite of the lack of sophistication in Gorgon Group’s activity, they were still relatively successful; once again proving that simple attacks on individuals without proper protections, work.Beginning in early March 2018, Unit 42 started observing targeted attacks against Russian, Spanish and United States government agencies operating in Pakistan. As we continued to investigate, it became apparent that Gorgon Group had been consistently targeting worldwide governmental organizations operating within Pakistan. While Gorgon Group has been making minor changes in their methodologies, they are still actively involved in both targeted and criminal attacks. This Gorgon Group campaign leveraged spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199. The spear phishing emails involved in this campaign would most often originate from Gmail accounts masquerading as legitimate individuals, such as a prominent Lt. Col in the Pakistani military. The subjects of the spear phishing emails were also interesting, often contained subject matter related to terrorist groups, military activity, or political topics.The payloads for these attacks varied in malware family. The popular NanoCoreRAT, QuasarRAT, and NJRAT variants were used heavily. In a number of these attacks, the popular third-party URL shortening service Bitly was used to ultimately deliver the payloads for these attacks. It's important to remember, that while we were using Bitly links to help gauge click location, anyone who clicks these links (including researchers) are also counted. So, while having this click information is valuable, it's only one small piece of a larger picture related to targeting.The heaviest concentration of Bitly URL interaction came from Pakistan, which at 410 clicks accounted for 39% of all clicks. The United States amassed 194 clicks, accounting for 19%.The attacks took place primarily in March, late April, and early May of this year.Gorgon Group isn't the first actor group we've witnessed dabble in both nation state level and criminal attacks. What makes Gorgon Group unique is, that despite the group’s operational security failures, they still remained particularly effective. Looking closer at the actors participating in Gorgon Group gave us a unique perspective into the inner workings of an attack. Leveraging the same infrastructure for targeted attacks and criminal enterprises made for an interesting cross-section of mixed intentions. Ultimately, this lead us to the conclusion that several of Gorgon Group’s members have a nexus in Pakistan. While Gorgon Group remains active,",

        "explain": "HEXANE intrusion activity includes malicious documents that drop malware to establish footholds for follow-on activity. Although the group appears operational since at least mid-2018, activity accelerated in early- to mid-2019. This timeline, targeting, and increase of operations coincides with an escalation of tensions within Middle East, a current area of political and military conflict. HEXANE’s telecommunications targeting appears to follow a trend demonstrated by other activity groups. ICS adversaries are increasingly targeting third-party organizations along the supply chains of potential targets. For instance, in 2018, Dragos identified the activity group XENOTIME targeting several industrial original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and hardware and software suppliers. By compromising devices, firmware, or telecommunications networks used by targets within ICS, malicious activity could potentially enter the victim environment through a trusted vendor, bypassing much of the entity’s security stack. HEXANE demonstrates similarities to the activity groups MAGNALLIUM and CHRYSENE. All are ICS-targeting activities focusing largely on oil and gas, and some of the behaviors and recently observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are similar. Like HEXANE, MAGNALLIUM also increased its activity in early- to mid-2019. Dragos identified recent MAGNALLIUM activity targeting US government and financial organizations as well as oil and gas companies, attempting to gain access to computers at target organizations. However, the collection of HEXANE behaviors, tools, and victimology makes this a unique entity compared to these previously-observed activity groups. For instance, HEXANE’s observed victimology is mostly focused on critical infrastructure, but divided between ICS verticals and telecommunications operations. Additionally, its infrastructure and capabilities — such as using malicious domains patterned after general IT themes and newly identified detection evasion schemes — are different from related groups. Dragos categorizes activity groups based on the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis and groups activity by the observed actions, capabilities, and demonstrated – not implied or assumed – intentions. These attributes can be combined to construct and implement defensive strategies. At this time, Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that HEXANE does not possess the access nor capability to disrupt ICS networks.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has discovered a new Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign focusing on luring unsuspecting victims through phishing websites mimicking well-known software applications. In this campaign, a phishing website was observed masquerading as OpenVPN software tailored for Chinese users and serves as a host to deliver the malicious payload. Once executed, the installer drops and runs Rust-based malware on the system, subsequently triggering a Shellcode. The Shellcode performs anti-debugging and decryption operations. Afterward, it establishes encrypted Command and Control (C&C) communication with a remote Threat Actor (TA). Surprisingly, the characteristics of this malware bear similarities to those previously employed by the Higaisa APT group in their past campaigns. Further investigation revealed that the C&C IP was associated with three additional malicious installers responsible for downloading Google Meet and Zoom, indicating a broader and coordinated malicious effort.Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) discovered a phishing website named “open-vpn[.]top” on October 16th. This deceptive site is designed to imitate the legitimate OpenVPN website. It is suspected to be associated with a new campaign initiated by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group called Higaisa. Higaisa APT is believed to have South Korean origins and was initially disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence Center in early 2019. The group’s malicious activities can be traced back to at least 2016, involving the use of Trojans such as Gh0st and PlugX, as well as mobile malware. Their targets encompass government officials, human rights organizations, and other entities associated with North Korea. Phishing websites are frequently utilized by Threat Actors (TAs) as their primary method for distributing malware. These TAs frequently employ brand impersonation in their phishing campaigns, adeptly tricking users into a false sense of trust and legitimacy, ultimately enticing unsuspecting individuals. Given the widespread use of VPNs by individuals to overcome online censorship, it is conceivable that these TAs are specifically targeting those seeking to evade such restrictions. The image below depicts the fraudulent OpenVPN website.The website hosted a malicious OpenVPN installer file, which is bundled with a genuine OpenVPN executable and a malicious Rust-based executable. Notably, the Rust-based executable has a valid digital signature. This digital signature is attributed to the Chinese organization “Zhiya Yunke (Chengdu) Finance and Tax Service Co., Ltd.,” as shown below.CRIL investigated further to identify any resemblances to previous campaigns. During this analysis, we discovered that Malwarebytes had previously identified a campaign where the initial infection was initiated through LNK files. Additionally, Zscaler published an in-depth analysis of the final payload used in that campaign.We have obtained a file named “OpenVPN.exe” from the phishing website. This file is a 32-bit Graphical User Interface-based executable. Upon execution of the file, it initiates a prompt for the user to choose their desired language, as shown in the figure below. It displays an installation wizard to proceed with the installation process.During the installation, the installer drops several files in the “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenVPN” directory. These files consist of the genuine OpenVPN MSI installer (openvpn.msi), two legitimate runtime DLLs (vcruntime140.dll & vcruntime140Org.dll), and an additional malicious 64-bit console-based executable file written in the Rust programming language named “rom.exe,” which is a shellcode runner. Then, the installer file executes the malicious “rom.exe” file. The figure below shows the files dropped by the OpenVPN executable.When “rom.exe” is executed, the malware employs Windows APIs such as FindResource(), LoadResource(), and SizeofResource() to search for encrypted content stored within the executable’s resource section. Subsequently, it decrypts this content, which is a Shellcode and proceeds to execute it. The figure below shows the malware locating and executing the Shellcode.Upon execution, the Shellcode conducts an anti-debugging check by calculating a 32-bit hash of the current code section and subsequently comparing it to the original 32-bit hash of the code section. This check is designed to detect debugging attempts. When a debugger is in use, and a breakpoint is added, the debugger inserts the opcode “0xCC” at the location where the original opcode existed. This alteration to the opcode disrupts the original hash of the code section. If the hash does not match, the Shellcode terminates itself. The figure below shows the hash comparison.Subsequent to performing the anti-debugging operation, the malware proceeds secondary decryption of the Shellcode using a 16-byte XOR key and executes it, as shown in the figure below.After decryption, it creates a new thread with the purpose of generating a cryptographic session key. This key is intended to be sent to the C&C server to establish a secure communication channel. To generate the session key, the Shellcode initially utilizes the API function UUIDCreate(), which generates a 16-byte UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). This UUID will then be used for creating an AES encryption key. The code responsible for creating this UUID is depicted in the figure below.After generating the initial UUID, it proceeds to create an additional UUID. The last byte of the newly created UUID is typically used to generate a byte that will be used to compute a 32-bit hash using ROR and ADD-based instructions. This process is similar to the process used by shell code to compute hash at the time of anti-debugging operation. This hash is then passed to the CryptBinaryToStringA() API function for the purpose of generating Base64 encoded data using the second UUID, as shown in the figure below.The Shellcode employs the Windows Crypto API CryptCreateHash() to generate an MD5 hash using the first UUID. Subsequently, the Shellcode proceeds to create a second MD5 hash, this time of the previously generated hash. The figure below shows the routine for creating these hashes.Once the hashes are generated, the Shellcode proceeds to create a 128-bit AES encryption key using the CryptDeriveKey() function. The figure below shows the routine involved in creating this 128-bit AES key.The newly generated AES key is employed to enable encrypted communication with the C&C server. To establish a secure connection with the C&C server, the Shellcode utilizes a socket. Following the key initialization, the Shellcode initiates another thread, within which it establishes a socket connection and verifies the internet connectivity. To determine internet availability, the Shellcode evaluates connections to a predefined list of websites. If any of these websites can be reached, the Shellcode proceeds with additional operations. The figure below shows the routine containing hardcoded URLs.Following an internet connectivity check, the Shellcode initiates communication with the C&C server. To facilitate this communication, the Shellcode spawns additional threads. Specifically, it creates two additional threads that collaborate to manage the commands exchanged between the backdoor and the C&C server. The Shellcode creates a dispatch thread to handle the commands posted by the worker thread. The function of the dispatch thread is to create a message queue leveraging the PeekMessageW() API. Then, the worker thread proceeds to send the message ID alongside the command buffer to the message queue using the PostThreadMessageW() API. Once the dispatch thread receives a message from the worker thread, the message is then retrieved with the help of the GetMessageW() API. Based on the ID of the messages received, the command handler will accordingly receive the message. The figure below shows the dispatch thread.Upon establishing a successful connection with the C&C server, the attacker gains the ability to take control of the victim’s machine, perform malicious activities, and deploy additional malware, such as ransomware and others. CRIL also noticed three additional files engaged in communication with the C&C server, masquerading as GoogleMeet and ZoomInstaller.TAs often hide their malware payloads within genuine software installer files for various strategic reasons. This approach leverages the trust users have in legitimate software, increasing the likelihood of users willingly executing these files – believing them to be secure. Moreover, genuine software installers are frequently distributed through widely recognized channels, diminishing suspicion and boosting the chances of successful infiltration. In this case, TAs are concealing a shellcode runner within the legitimate OpenVPN software application. The analyzed Shellcode displays a high level of sophistication and presents a significant danger to unsuspecting users, largely due to the fact that the associated files possess valid digital signatures. This attribute significantly reduces the likelihood of detection at the time of writing this blog. Moreover, the manual nature of the malware’s operation suggests that the TAs are carefully selecting their targets for more precise and specific operations. This underscores the importance of user vigilance in light of the potential for further such attacks. Users should remain alert to the possibility of similar threats in the future.",

        "claim": "Inception Framework: Alive and Well, and Hiding Behind Proxies, The group has targeted multiple industries and governmental entities primarily in Russia, but has also been active in the United States and throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The cyber espionage group known as the Inception Framework has significantly developed its operations over the past three years, rolling out stealthy new tools and cleverly leveraging the cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to make its activities harder to detect. Since 2014, Symantec has found evidence of a steady stream of attacks from the Inception Framework targeted at organizations on several continents. As time has gone by, the group has become ever more secretive, hiding behind an increasingly complex framework of proxies and cloud services.The Inception Framework has been active since at least May 2014 and its activities were first exposed by Blue Coat (now part of Symantec) in December 2014. Right from the start, the group stood out because of its use of an advanced, highly automated framework to support its targeted attacks. This level of sophistication is rarely seen, even in the targeted attacks sphere. The nature of Inception’s targets, from 2014 right through to today, along with the capabilities of its tools, indicate that espionage is the primary motive of this groups In 2014, Inception was compromising targeted organizations using spear-phishing emails, which masqueraded as legitimate emails concerning international policy, upcoming conferences, and specific sectoral interests of the targeted organization. More than half of the group’s earlier targets were in the Energy or Defense sectors, but it also targeted organizations in the Consultancy/Security, Aerospace, Research, and Media sectors, in addition to embassies. Its activities ranged across the globe, with targets located in South Africa, Kenya, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Suriname, along with several other European and Middle Eastern countries. Word documents attached to Inception’s spear-phishing emails leveraged two Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761 and CVE-2012-0158) to install malware on the recipient’s computer. The malware had a multi-staged structure that began with a malicious RTF document and ended with an in-memory DLL payload that communicated, via the WebDAV protocol, with a command and control (C&C) address from a legitimate cloud service provider (CloudMe.com). The name “Inception” comes from the group’s many levels of obfuscation and indirection it employed in delivering this payload. Further layers of obfuscation emerged when Blue Coat was able to determine that the attackers were communicating with CloudMe.com through a hacked network of compromised routers, the majority of which were located in South Korea.Following its exposure in late 2014, Inception fell quiet. However, this turned out to be only a brief hiatus and, by April 2015, there had been a resurgence in activity. Attacks have continued since then, right through to 2017.In the intervening years, the Inception Framework has evolved, adding additional layers of obfuscation in a bid to avoid detection. The group is using new types of lure documents in its spear-phishing campaigns and its malware has expanded to use new types of plugins. Inception has also increased its use of the cloud, and diversified the range of cloud providers it uses for C&C purposes.The locations of Inception’s targets have shifted since 2014, but the group continues to have a global reach. Russia accounted for the largest number of attacks between 2015 and 2017, followed by Ukraine, Moldova, Belgium, Iran, and France.Since 2014, the Inception Framework has steadily changed its tools and techniques. In its early attacks, the group’s malware payload (with the exception of plugins) was fully contained within an exploit document emailed to the victim. In more recent activity, these spear-phishing attacks are now a two-stage process. The group will first email the target a malicious “Reconnaissance document” which, if opened, will fingerprint the target computer, gathering information on what software it is running and whether that software is up to date. Several days later, Inception will send a second spear-phishing email to the target, with another malicious document attached. This document is designed to retrieve a remote RTF file, which contains the exploit, and open it on the target’s computer. Shortly after this RTF document is opened, the remaining stages of the Inception malware are found executing on the system. The loader DLL is responsible for decrypting and injecting the core payload DLL into memory, from an encrypted file present on disk. The core payload DLL's main function is to gather system information, execute other malware in the form of plugins, and update itself. It accesses C&C via WebDAV hosted on legitimate cloud storage providers. The use of an initial reconnaissance document allows Inception to profile the target’s computer and potentially customize any subsequent malicious document to exploit known vulnerabilities in unpatched software on the computer. By breaking its attacks up into distinct stages, Inception also makes them harder to detect. For investigators to trace an attack, each stage will have be uncovered and referenced to the other stages.Inception’s malware is modular and the attackers will load plugins based on requirements for each attack. The group has used a range of plugins in recent attacks, some of which are improved versions of plugins used in 2014, while others were previously unseen. File hunting plugin: The most frequently used plugin, similar to one used in 2014. Often used to collect Office files from temporary internet history. Detailed survey plugin: Used to gather domain membership, processes/loaded modules, hardware enumeration, installed products, logical and mapped drive information. Evolution of earlier plugin used in 2014. Browser plugin: Used to steal browser history, stored passwords and sessions. Works with Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Torch, and Yandex. File listing plugin: Works on local or remote drives and can map additional paths when given credentials.Since 2014, Inception has widened its use of cloud service providers for C&C purposes. Whereas previously it relied on one service provider (CloudMe.com), more recently it has employed a least five cloud service providers Leveraging the cloud for C&C has a number of advantages for groups like Inception. Any C&C communications will involve encrypted traffic to a known website, meaning it is less likely to raise flags on targeted networks. Legitimate cloud services are not likely to be blacklisted. Varying the cloud service provider used adds a further degree of stealth. Once it became known Inception was using a single provider, any traffic to that provider may have attracted additional scrutiny. Symantec has notified all cloud providers affected. Where possible Symantec has provided details on the C&C accounts used by Inception to the affected cloud providers. The accounts in questions have been deleted or disabled.Inception is continuing to use chains of infected routers to act as proxies and mask communications between the attackers and the cloud service providers they use. Certain router manufacturers have UPnP listening on WAN as a default configuration. Akamai research has found that there are 765,000 devices vulnerable to this attack. These routers are hijacked by Inception and configured to forward traffic from one port to another host on the internet. Abuse of this service requires no custom malware to be injected on the routers and can be used at scale very easily. Inception strings chains of these routers together to create multiple proxies to hide behind.Every connection builds different chains of infected routers and once the connection is complete, it cleans up after itself. In several cases, Symantec has been able to follow the entire chain of compromised routers and found it led to a virtual private server (VPS), meaning the attackers have employed an additional layer of security by routing communications through rented hosting servers.Inception has an ongoing interest in mobile devices and has previously developed malware to infect Android (Android.Lastacloud), iOS (IOS.Lastaccoud) and BlackBerry devices (BBOS.Lastacloud). Mobile malware continues to be deployed and the group has made some modifications to its Android malware. The malware is spread via SMS messages and emails containing malicious links. Once installed, it uses user profile pages on online forums as dead drops for its C&C.Even prior to its discovery in 2014, Inception went to great lengths both to avoid detection and conceal its location. Exposure hasn’t deterred the group. Instead, it has redoubled its efforts, adding more layers of obfuscation to an already complex attack framework. Its persistence, stealth, and global reach mean the group continues to pose an ongoing risk to organizations, particularly in its areas of interest, which include defense, aerospace, energy, governments, telecoms, media, and finance. Aside from a suite of advanced modular malware, the group is notable for its ability to make use of new platforms such as the cloud, IoT, and mobile to facilitate its attacks. An “early adopter”, Inception’s tactics may point the way towards how other espionage groups may modify their methods in years to come.",

        "claim": "IndigoZebra is a Chinese state-sponsored actor mentioned for the first time by Kaspersky in its APT Trends report Q2 2017, targeting, at the time of its discovery, former Soviet Republics with multiple malware strains including Meterpreter, Poison Ivy, xDown, and a previously unknown backdoor called “xCaon.",
        "original_label": "true",

        "explain": "Check Point research recently discovered an ongoing spear-phishing campaign targeting the Afghan government. Further investigation revealed this campaign was a part of a long-running activity targeting other Central-Asia countries, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, since at least 2014. The actor suspected of this cyber-espionage operation is an APT group dubbed “IndigoZebra“, previously attributed by researchers to China. The technical details of the operation were not publicly disclosed before. In this article, we will discuss the tools, TTPs and infrastructure used by the attacker during the years of its activity. We will also provide technical analysis of the two different strains of the previously publicly undescribed backdoor xCaon, including its latest version we dubbed BoxCaon which uses the legitimate cloud-storage service Dropbox to act as its Command and Control server.Our investigation started with the emails sent from an employee of the Administrative Office of the President in Afghanistan to the employees of the Afghanistan National Security Council (NSC). The email asked the recipient to review the modifications in the document related to the upcoming press conference of the NSC.The email contains a password-protected RAR archive named NSC Press conference.rar. Extracting the archive with the password provided in the email requires user interaction and therefore provides a challenge for some sandbox security solutions.The extracted file, NSC Press conference.exe, acts as a dropper. The content of the lure email suggests that the attached file is the document, hence, to reduce the suspicion of the victim running the executable, the attackers use the simple trick – the first document on the victim’s desktop is opened for the user upon the dropper execution. Whether the dropper found a document to open or not, it will proceed to the next stage – drop the backdoor to C:\\sers\\public\\spools.exe and execute it.The backdoor contain narrow capabilities: download and upload files, run commands and send the attackers the results. However short the list, they allow the attackers to upload and execute additional tools for further reconnaissance and lateral movement. To hide malicious functionality – persistence and C&C communication – from static detections, the malware uses a common obfuscation technique known as “stackstrings” to build wide char strings.The backdoor utilizes Dropbox as a C&C server, by sending and receiving commands written to a specific folder in a specially created Dropbox account, prepared by the attacker before the operation. By using the legitimate Dropbox service for C&C communications, instead of regular dedicated server infrastructure, aids in masking the malicious traffic in the target’s network, as no communication to abnormal websites is taking place. The backdoor uses the Dropbox API with a hardcoded bearer access token and has the ability to download, upload, and execute files. In the initialization stage, the backdoor creates a unique folder for the victim in an attacker-controlled Dropbox account. The folder is named by the victim’s MAC address which is obtained using GetAdaptersInfo API.Locally, the backdoor creates a working folder at C:\\users\\public\\ (where is a random integer). It then proceeds by uploading two files to the server: m-.txt – containing the backdoor execution path d-.txt – containing the local working folder path.When the attackers need to send a file or command to the victim machine, they place them to the folder named d in the victim’s Dropbox folder. The malware retrieves this folder and downloads all its contents to the working folder. Finally, if the file named c.txt – that contains the attacker command, exists in this working folder, the backdoor executes it using the ComSpec environment variable, which normally points to the command line interpreter (like cmd.exe), and uploads the results back to the Dropbox drive while deleting the command from the server.The backdoor establishes persistence by setting the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\load registry key to point to its executable. This method is less common than Run or RunOnce keys but achieves its ultimate goal: the program listed in the Load registry value runs when any user logs on.Once the C&C communication is established, the threat actor starts by executing fingerprinting and reconnaissance commands on the machine. In this attack, some of the actions we spotted included: Download and execution of ntbscan (SHA-1: 90da10004c8f6fafdaa2cf18922670a745564f45) – NetBIOS scanner tool widely used by multiple APT actor including the prolific Chinese group APT10 Execution of Windows built-in networking utility tools Access to the victim’s files, especially documents located on the Desktop.Searching for related samples in the wild yielded almost 30 executables, each of them bear varying degrees of similarity with the spools.exe BoxCaon backdoor. One of the common similarities is a very specific implementation of the command execution: first constructing the ComSpec string on stack, using the same path naming convention for the output file, and deleting it right after the execution.The earliest of the found samples is dated back to 2014. Even though some of the executables claim to be compiled in 2004 or 2008, based on the C&C servers registration time and the activity, we believe the compilation date was probably modified by the actor. While we were collecting additional information about this long-lasting operation, we noticed a reference to the Kaspersky 2017 APT trends report where one of the samples is referred to as xCaon malware, used by the Chinese-speaking APT actor “IndigoZebra“. The other samples in our set appear to be the different variants of xCaon, including packed ones, or the PoisonIvy malware which was also reported as a part of the actor’s arsenal. Based on the code and functionality similarities we can attribute the BoxCaon backdoor to the updated variant of the same xCaon family (hence the name). It is the only xCaon version that communicates over Dropbox API in clear text commands, whereas all the other samples use HTTP protocol with Base64+XOR encryption to communicate with their C&C servers. Although the xCaon malware family is used in the wild for several years, there was no technical analysis publicly available until now. In the next section, we will summarize the technical details of all the versions we’ve encountered.As mentioned earlier, we found an approximate of 30 different samples of the xCaon HTTP variant with slightly different functionality. Below we will cover the most note-worthy features of the backdoor, highlighting samples with unique functionality.The HTTP variant checks if Kaspersky is installed on the victim’s machine by searching for the existence of files in the Kaspersky installation folder.If Kaspersky AV is not installed on the system, persistence via registry is installed. First, the backdoor makes sure that a copy of the executable exists in the specific path of the TEMP folder, and then the path is written to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\load key, causing the malware to run each time any user logs in.The backdoor receives commands from the attacker and runs them in an interactive CMD shell using pipes. The commands may differ between the samples,The backdoor collects the victim’s MAC address using the GetAdaptersInfo API. Some of the versions generate a user ID and save it in a temporary file. These IDs are then passed to the C&C server as one of the POST body parameters (MAC address is sent encrypted as discussed later).he communication between the malware and the server is based on the HTTP protocol and slightly varies between the samples. Every few seconds the backdoor sends a POST request to the C&C URL. In the response (which looks like an HTML page), the malware searches for a specific pattern: it takes the string between , decodes it, and executes the command. The result is encrypted and sent back to another URL on the server as the parameter of a POST request.The HTTP variant used an interesting and unique method of encryption for both configuration and communication. It uses a predefined key, which we found to be one of the following two (depends on the malware variant): 1. \"GetMessagePos SendMessage GetExitCodeProces CreateProcess GetTickCount GetDCEx CopyImage DrawText CloseHandle SendMessageTimeout\"  The decryption process is based on splitting the “fake” base64-like string into two strings, XORing the first part with the predefined key, base64-decoding the second part, and finally, XOR both the results.While we saw the Dropbox variant (BoxCaon) targeting Afghan government officials, the HTTP variants are focused on political entities in two particular Central Asian countries – Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. This very specific victimology is based upon the following overlapping indicators: Check Point products’ telemetry C&C domains impersonating known Uzbek and Kyrgyz domains (post[.]mfa-uz[.]com – Uzbekistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs; ousync[.]kginfocom[.]com – Kyrgyz state enterprise “Infocom”) Malware names of the samples were written in Kyrgyz and Russian (Министрге сунуштама.exe – Recommendation to the Minister.exe in Kyrgyz; материалы к массовому беспорядку.exe – materials to riots.exe in non-native Russian) VT submitters’ countries for multiple samples from this campaign are Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.As the Dropbox variant uses Dropbox API for communication, the only information we were able to gather from it is the Dropbox account information [Appendix C]. However, when we analyzed the infrastructure of the HTTP variants, we saw that the samples have a common infrastructure for over 6 years since the first sample was in the wild.To get a clearer picture of how the attackers operated their infrastructure throughout the years, we have plotted the various malicious domains according to the ASN they were hosted on.Most of the domains are relatively short-lived. This can be explained by the precision targeting of the whole operation: the lookalike domains were most likely created to mislead a specific entity and were not reused anymore. Since 2019, all of the new infrastructure has been concentrated on ASN 20473 (CHOOPA). This observation does not come as a surprise: Vultr, a subsidiary of CHOOPA, is considered an “attractive platform for criminals” by the research community and widely used for malicious purposes by multiple groups including, for example, Chinese-based APT group ViciousPanda whose recent C&C servers are also all hosted on Vultr servers.In this publication we unveiled the latest activity and tools of the long-running IndigoZebra operation, previously attributed to a Chinese-speaking threat actor. In this case, we observed a cyber-espionage operation focusing on governmental agencies in Central Asia, being targeted with the Poison Ivy and xCaon backdoors, along with the newly discovered BoxCaon backdoor variant – whose C&C communication capability was updated to utilize the Dropbox service itself as the C&C infrastructure of the operation. While the IndigoZebra actor was initially observed targeting former Soviet republics such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, we have now witnessed that its campaigns do not dial down, but on the contrary – they expand to the new targets in the region, with a new toolset.

In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking rojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted Indrik Spider millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware. In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by Indrik Spider, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy. Indrik Spider appears to be a subgroup of TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen. In 2019, a subgroup of Indrik Spider split off into Doppel Spider. Dridex has been observed to be distributed via Necurs (operated by Monty Spider) and Emotet (operated by Mummy Spider, TA542).",

        "explain": "The cyberspy group’s activities are broader than originally thought. The Ke3chang cyberespionage group, a.k.a. APT15, Mirage, Playful Dragon or Vixen Panda, has been tied to a backdoor called Okrum that has been used to target diplomatic missions throughout Europe and Latin America. The attribution widens the scope of known Ke3chang activity, an APT believed to be operating from China. Ke3change first appeared in 2010, making a name for itself by developing simple but custom malware like the BS2005/Ketrican backdoors and the RoyalDNS malware and deploying it in what was dubbed “Operation Ke3chang.” Almost 10 years later, the group continues to be active according to ESET, using revamped versions of BS2005/Ketrican. Connecting the Dots In 2015, Ke3chang made a splash by continuing its previous Operation Ke3chang attacks that centered around Slovakia, using the BS2005/Ketrican backdoor family. The following year, ESET discovered Okrum, focused on the same type of targets: Diplomatic missions in Slovakia, Belgium, Chile, Guatemala and Brazil, with the attackers showing a particular interest in Slovakia. The attackers were also seen using a related TidePool malware family discovered by Palo Alto Networks that targeted Indian embassies across the globe. The Okrum activity continued through 2017 and the ESET team has been able to tie it back to Ke3chang, with Okrum observed acting as a first-stage malware that then fetched Ketrican samples to install on a compromised machine. “Our research has shown that the Ketrican, Okrum and RoyalDNS backdoors detected by ESET after 2015 are linked to previously documented Ke3chang group activity, and to each other, in a number of ways,” said ESET researcher Zuzana Hromcová, in an analysis [PDF] posted on Thursday. “[Since then], Ketrican backdoors from 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have all evolved from malware used in Operation Ke3chang.” The Okrum backdoor, which hasn’t been previously documented publicly, is installed and loaded by two earlier-stage loaders that change frequently in an effort to evade detection, according to ESET. The actual Okrum payload — an encrypted malicious DLL – uses steganography to slip past defenses, hiding and embedding itself in an innocuous-looking PNG image. “When the file is viewed in an image viewer, a familiar image is displayed, but the Okrum loaders are able to locate an extra encrypted file that the user cannot see,” Hromcová said. Okrum is only equipped with basic backdoor commands, such as downloading and uploading files, executing files and shell commands, according to ESET. “Most of the malicious activity has to be performed by typing shell commands manually, or by executing other tools and software [such as a keylogger, tools for dumping passwords or enumerating network sessions],” said the researcher. “This is a common practice of the Ke3chang group,” she added, noting that the Ketrican backdoors also use similar external utilities, perhaps in an attempt to evade behavioral detection. What remains to be answered, she added, is how the malware was distributed to the victim machines. ESET noted that, though Okrum is not technically complex, the fact that the malicious actors behind it tried to remain undetected with novel approaches, along with the visible evolution and code improvements from 2015 to 2019 in Ketrican, show that the Ke3chang APT group is in it for the long haul. “The Ke3chang APT group (a.k.a. APT15) has rightfully been on the radar of security researchers because of its decade-long operation, targeting high-value victims such as diplomatic entities, and other geopolitical aspects associated with them,” according to the analysis.",

        "claim": "LAPSUS$ specializes in large-scale social engineering and extortion operations, including destructive attacks without the use of ransomware, which group has targeted organizations globally, including in the government, manufacturing, higher education, energy, healthcare, technology, telecommunications, and media sectors.",
        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Many organizations are already struggling to combat cybersecurity threats from ransomware purveyors and state-sponsored hacking groups, both of which tend to take days or weeks to pivot from an opportunistic malware infection to a full blown data breach. But few organizations have a playbook for responding to the kinds of virtual “smash and grab” attacks we’ve seen recently from LAPSUS$, a juvenile data extortion group whose short-lived, low-tech and remarkably effective tactics have put some of the world’s biggest corporations on edge.Since surfacing in late 2021, LAPSUS$ has gained access to the networks or contractors for some of the world’s largest technology companies, including Microsoft, NVIDIA, Okta and Samsung. LAPSUS$ typically threatens to release sensitive data unless paid a ransom, but with most victims the hackers ended up publishing any information they stole (mainly computer source code). Microsoft blogged about its attack at the hands of LAPSUS$, and about the group targeting its customers. It found LAPSUS$ used a variety of old-fashioned techniques that seldom show up in any corporate breach post-mortems, such as: -targeting employees at their personal email addresses and phone numbers; -offering to pay $20,000 a week to employees who give up remote access credentials; -social engineering help desk and customer support employees at targeted companies; -bribing/tricking employees at mobile phone stores to hijack a target’s phone number; -intruding on their victims’ crisis communications calls post-breach. If these tactics sound like something you might sooner expect from spooky, state-sponsored “Advanced Persistent Threat” or APT groups, consider that the core LAPSUS$ members are thought to range in age from 15 to 21. Also, LAPSUS$ operates on a shoestring budget and is anything but stealthy: According to Microsoft, LAPSUS$ doesn’t seem to cover its tracks or hide its activity. In fact, the group often announces its hacks on social media.This unusual combination makes LAPSUS$ something of an aberration that is probably more aptly referred to as “Advanced Persistent Teenagers,” said one CXO at a large organization that recently had a run-in with LAPSUS$. “There is a lot of speculation about how good they are, tactics et cetera, but I think it’s more than that,” said the CXO, who spoke about the incident on condition of anonymity. “They put together an approach that industry thought suboptimal and unlikely. So it’s their golden hour.” LAPSUS$ seems to have conjured some worst-case scenarios in the minds of many security experts, who worry what will happen when more organized cybercriminal groups start adopting these techniques. “LAPSUS$ has shown that with only $25,000, a group of teenagers could get into organizations with mature cybersecurity practices,” said Amit Yoran, CEO of security firm Tenable and a former federal cybersecurity czar, testifying last week before the House Homeland Security Committee. “With much deeper pockets, focus, and mission, targeting critical infrastructure. That should be a sobering, if not terrifying, call to action.” My CXO source said LAPSUS$ succeeds because they simply refuse to give up, and just keep trying until someone lets them in. “They would just keep jamming a few individuals to get [remote] access, read some onboarding documents, enroll a new 2FA [two-factor authentication method] and exfiltrate code or secrets, like a smash-and-grab,” the CXO said. “These guys were not leet, just damn persistent.”The smash-and-grab attacks by LAPSUS$ obscure some of the group’s less public activities, which according to Microsoft include targeting individual user accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges to drain crypto holdings. In some ways, the attacks from LAPSUS$ recall the July 2020 intrusion at Twitter, wherein the accounts for Apple, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Kanye West, Uber and others were made to tweet messages inviting the world to participate in a cryptocurrency scam that promised to double any amount sent to specific wallets. The flash scam netted the perpetrators more than $100,000 in the ensuing hours.The group of teenagers who hacked Twitter hailed from a community that traded in hacked social media accounts. This community places a special premium on accounts with short “OG” usernames, and some of its most successful and notorious members were known to use all of the methods Microsoft attributed to LAPSUS$ in the service of hijacking prized OG accounts. The Twitter hackers largely pulled it off by brute force, writes Wired on the July 15, 2020 hack. “Someone was trying to phish employee credentials, and they were good at it,” Wired reported. “They were calling up consumer service and tech support personnel, instructing them to reset their passwords. Many employees passed the messages onto the security team and went back to business. But a few gullible ones—maybe four, maybe six, maybe eight—were more accommodating. They went to a dummy site controlled by the hackers and entered their credentials in a way that served up their usernames and passwords as well as multifactor authentication codes.” Twitter revealed that a key tactic of the group was “phone spear phishing” (a.k.a. “voice phishing” a.k.a. “vishing”). This involved calling up Twitter staffers using false identities, and tricking them into giving up credentials for an internal company tool that let the hackers reset passwords and multi-factor authentication setups for targeted users. In August 2020, KrebsOnSecurity warned that crooks were using voice phishing to target new hires at major companies, impersonating IT employees and asking them to update their VPN client or log in at a phishing website that mimicked their employer’s VPN login page. Two days after that story ran, the FBI and the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued their own warning on vishing, saying the attackers typically compiled dossiers on employees at specific companies by mass-scraping public profiles on social media platforms, recruiter and marketing tools, publicly available background check services, and open-source research. The primary danger with smash-and-grab groups like LAPSUS$ is not just their persistence but their ability to extract the maximum amount of sensitive information from their victims using compromised user accounts that typically have a short lifespan. After all, in many attacks, the stolen credentials are useful only so long as the impersonated employee isn’t also trying to use them. This dynamic puts tremendous pressure on cyber incident response teams, which suddenly are faced with insiders who are trying frantically to steal everything of perceived value within a short window of time. On top of that, LAPSUS$ has a habit of posting screenshots on social media touting its access to internal corporate tools. These images and claims quickly go viral and create a public relations nightmare for the victim organization. Single sign-on provider Okta experienced this firsthand last month, when LAPSUS$ posted screenshots that appeared to show Okta’s Slack channels and another with a Cloudflare interface. Cloudflare responded by resetting its employees’ Okta credentials. Okta quickly came under fire for posting only a brief statement that said the screenshots LAPSUS$ shared were connected to a January 2022 incident involving the compromise of “a third-party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors,” and that “the matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor.” This assurance apparently did not sit well with many Okta customers, especially after LAPSUS$ began posting statements that disputed some of Okta’s claims. On March 25, Okta issued an apology for its handling of the January breach at a third-party support provider, which ultimately affected hundreds of its customers. My CXO source said the lesson from LAPSUS$ is that even short-lived intrusions can have a long-term negative impact on victim organizations — especially when victims are not immediately forthcoming about the details of a security incident that affects customers. “It does force us to think about insider access differently,” the CXO told KrebsOnSecurity. “Nation states have typically wanted longer, more strategic access; ransomware groups want large lateral movement. LAPSUS$ doesn’t care, it’s more about, ‘What can these 2-3 accounts get me in the next 6 hours?’ We haven’t optimized to defend that.” Any organizations wondering what they can do to harden their systems against attacks from groups like LAPSUS$ should consult Microsoft’s recent blog post on the group’s activities, tactics and tools. Microsoft’s guidance includes recommendations that can help prevent account takeovers or at least mitigate the impact from stolen employee credentials.2-3 compromised credentials that can get to crown jewels in 6-24 hours is game over. How much resource compartmentalization does a “mature cybersecurity practice” entail? Central-vpn traffic monitoring for realtime credential detection? De-automated TFA + sanity✓? When ring-X keyholding insiders are so easily fooled or able to be bought out without supervision, the supervision required has to be draconian = and users will absolutely complain. Meanwhile the overhead required to segment and authenticate all access properly is not “business friendly.” It requires practices and dedicated heads that (most?) many organizations have little interest in, as it’s all cost and hassle and complaints with an intangible upside. Until it happens.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A new threat group, nicknamed LazyScripter, has been identified. An analysis of several malicious emails targeting individuals looking for work in Canada lead to its discovery. Further investigation uncovered a targeted spam campaign dating back to 2018, which mainly targeted the airline industry. The new threat group was discovered by Malwarebytes researchers while analyzing phishing emails targeting individuals looking for work in Canada. Further investigation led researchers to discover that the group had been active since 2018 but had remained unidentified. Initially researchers tried to attribute the group’s activities to known APT groups but found this was not possible. “In terms of attribution. It’s hard to really attribute this group to any known groups,” said Hossein Jazi, senior threat intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes. “Even though some similarities between this actor and documented APT actors such as APT28 and OilRig exist, these indicators are not enough to attribute to any of these groups,” Malwarebytes states in its report on LazyScripter. Consequently, the researchers decided they had discovered a new APT group, which they nicknamed LazyScripter. APT groups are usually tracked according to their targets and the type of tools and methods they use. Researchers found that LazyScripter resembled the threat actors OilRig, APT28 (aka Fancy Bear) and MuddyWater, but not closely enough. LayzScripter is like the Iranian group OilRig and the Russian group APT28 in as much as it uses similar malware. Of the three threat actors, however, LazyScripter was found to be most like the Iranian APT group MuddyWater. Nevertheless, unlike MuddyWater, LazyScripter does not conduct targeted campaigns, relying on spam to reach its victims instead. Furthermore, the malware used by LazyScripter has not been used by MuddyWater in the past. LazyScripter uses widely available toolsets whereas MuddyWater uses custom malware tools in its operations. Nonetheless, due to its similarities to the two Middle Eastern actors, Jazi stated that “there is a high chance that the actor is based in the Middle East.” LazyScripter’s targeted spam campaign is believed to date back to at least 2018. Its targets are mainly the International Air Transport Association, airlines and individuals looking to move to Canada for work. The group’s motive appears to be stealing private information and business intelligence for use in future targeted attacks. The group uses phishing emails to attack its victims, which typically contain malicious documents and ZIP archives. Usually the attached documents are pdf, Microsoft Word or Excel files that contain one or two embedded objects. These objects link to GitHub from which two open-source multistage RATs, Octopus and Koadic, are downloaded and deployed onto victims’ systems. Koadic is a publicly available Windows post-exploitation and penetration testing tool. Octopus is a Windows Trojan that, among other things, enables data theft. As well as phishing emails targeting the airline industry, the group has sent other themed emails. These have included emails related to BSPLink, a financial settlement service many airlines use, Covid-19 and Microsoft updates. Also sent out were tourism and visa related phishing emails. In one phishing campaign, LazyScript used a legitimate Canadian immigration website to lure its victims in. According to Jazi, Malwarebytes’ study of LazyScripter has revealed that it is not as sophisticated as other threat groups. Unlike more sophisticated APT groups like Lazarus and Palmerworm, LazyScripter does not develop its own custom malware. Instead, it relies on already available software. “What was interesting about this actor is how much it is really relying on open source and commercially available toolsets to operate,” Jazi, stated. Malwarebytes researchers also found that LazyScripter has changed its main toolset over the years. Up until 2020 the group used the commercially available Powershell Empire to break into its victims’ systems. This was installed using the loader Malwarebytes calls Empoder. However, recently LazyScripter switched to the double RAT toolset comprising of Octopus and Koadic. This toolset is being installed with a new loader Malwarebytes has called Koctopus.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Researchers with Symantec have uncovered a malicious threat actor group called Leafminer, which is based in Iran and has been active since at least 2017. Since last year, the group has targeted hundreds of organizations, including government, finance and energy in the Middle East, according to the July 25 report. In their report, Symantec researchers found that the group will adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and experiments, as well as publishing proof-of-concept exploits. The group has attempted to infiltrate target networks by water holing websites, creating vulnerability scans of network services on the Internet and using brute-force and dictionary login attempts. The group seems to be looking for email data, files and database servers on the target systems, according to Symantec. Symantec detection telemetry showed malware, as well as the custom tools used by Leafminer, distributed through 44 different systems across Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Israel and Lebanon.A list of 809 vulnerability scan targets was also found. The targets were in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel and Afghanistan. Obfuscated JavaScript code was also seen on compromised servers that were affected by a watering hole attack conducted by the group, which used a Lebanese government site, a Saudi Arabian healthcare site and an Azerbaijan university as the platforms. The code was designed to steal Samba networking protocol (SMB) credential hashes that could subsequently be brute-forced offline. The threat actor is not afraid to mimic other successful techniques as well. The group uses the EternalBlue vulnerability, which was leaked by the Shadow Brokers, to laterally move within networks that they have breached. The group also uses a Python script to scan for Heartbleed, a well-known OpenSSL vulnerability, in an attempt to get at encrypted data. Leafminer does have their own custom tools, however. Symantec did identity two strains of custom malware that were used: Trojan.Imecab and Backdoor.Sorgu. Directly connected to this malware are several sets of reflective loader DLLs that are used as droppers or to execute specific commands on a compromised system. Interestingly, these custom tools required Leafminer to load the .NET framework onto a compromised machines in order to allow them to run. Backdoor.Sorgu provides remote access to the infected machine. It is installed as a service in a Windows system through a shell command script.

Join us for the Deployment Strategies for 5G NR breakfast workshop in LA at MWCA on September 12. Register now to learn from and network with industry experts – communications service providers get in free! Trojan.Imecab sets up a persistent remote access account on the victim machine that has a hardcoded password. It installs itself in the system as a Windows service to achieve persistence. File exfiltration borrows a technique that was revealed at Black Hat Europe 2017 during a presentation called \"Lost in Transaction: Process Doppelgänging.\" It uses NTFS transactions to modify the executable of a seemingly benign process that is suspended right after creation. All this borrowing from other attackers has led Symantec researchers to conclude that group is likely still active, but the people running it are also inexperienced. \"Leafminer's eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of the attackers, a conclusion that's supported by the group's poor operational security,\" according to Symantec's research. \"It made a major blunder in leaving a staging server publicly accessible, exposing the group's entire arsenal of tools.\" This suggests Leafminer is not state-backed, but more a criminal operation with a Middle Eastern focus.",

        "label": "true",
        "explain": "This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory was written by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to provide information on a Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known in open-source reporting as APT40. This advisory provides APT40’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help cybersecurity practitioners identify and remediate APT40 intrusions and established footholds. APT40—aka BRONZE MOHAWK, FEVERDREAM, G0065, Gadolinium, GreenCrash, Hellsing, Kryptonite Panda, Leviathan, MUDCARP, Periscope, Temp.Periscope, and Temp.Jumper—is located in Haikou, Hainan Province, People’s Republic of China (PRC), and has been active since at least 2009. APT40 has targeted governmental organizations, companies, and universities in a wide range of industries—including biomedical, robotics, and maritime research—across the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and the South China Sea area, as well as industries included in China’s Belt and Road Initiative. On July 19, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against four APT40 cyber actors for their illicit computer network exploitation (CNE) activities via front company Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Company (Hainan Xiandun). Hainan Xiandun employee Wu Shurong cooperated with and carried out orders from PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) Hainan State Security Department (HSSD) intelligence officers Ding Xiaoyang, Zhu Yunmin, and Cheng Qingmin to conduct CNE. Wu’s CNE activities resulted in the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property, and other high-value information from companies and organizations in the United States and abroad, as well as from multiple foreign governments. These MSS-affiliated actors targeted victims in the following industries: academia, aerospace/aviation, biomedical, defense industrial base, education, government, healthcare, manufacturing, maritime, research institutes, and transportation (rail and shipping). Click here for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in STIX format. Note: to uncover malicious activity, incident responders search for IOCs in network- and host-based artifacts and assess the results—eliminating false positives during the assessment. For example, some MD5 IOCs in the STIX file identify legitimate tools—such as Putty, cmd.exe, svchost.exe, etc.—as indicators of compromise. Although the tools themselves are not malicious, APT40 attackers placed and used them from non-standard folders on victim systems during computer intrusion activity. If a legitimate tool is identified by an incident responder, then the location of the tool should be assessed to eliminate false positives or to uncover malicious activity. See Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more incident handling guidance. This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques. APT40 [G0065] has used a variety of tactics and techniques and a large library of custom and open-source malware—much of which is shared with multiple other suspected Chinese groups—to establish initial access via user and administrator credentials, enable lateral movement once inside the network, and locate high value assets in order to exfiltrate data. Table 1 provides details on these tactics and techniques. Note: see the appendix for a list of the domains, file names, and malware MD5 hash values used to facilitate this activity. APT40 used the following domains, file names, and malware MD5 hash values to facilitate the CNE activity outlined in this CSA between 2009 through 2018.",

        "label": "true",
        "explain": "The group’s capabilities are more than the much discussed CVE-2012-0158 exploits over the past few years. Instead, the group is known to have employed half day spearphish exploits, strategic web compromises, and watering holes employing fake Flash player update re-directions. The group’s spearphish toolset includes PDF exploits, Adobe Flash Player exploits, and the common CVE-2012-0158 Word exploits including those generated from the infamous “Tran Duy Linh” kit. While ongoing attacks by the Spring Dragon APT take us back to a focus on Vietnam, they appear to have rolled out a steady mix of exploits against defense subcontractors around the world and government related organizations in VN, TW, PH, and other locations over the past few years. Let’s take a quick look at a couple more examples of their intrusion capabilities that haven’t been mentioned elsewhere.Organizations located in Myanmar and targeted by Spring Dragon have gone unmentioned. But Spring Dragon’s infiltration techniques there were not simply 0158 spearphish, they also compromised sites. In one case, they replaced specialized font installers needed to render Myanma font. You can see an image here of the “Planet Myanmar” website in late 2012 distributing such a package. All of the zip links were redirected to a poisoned installer zip file. The download name was “Zawgyi_Keyboard_L.zip”, and it dropped a “setup.exe” that contained several backdoor components, including an Elise “wincex.dll” (a42c966e26f3577534d03248551232f3, detected as Backdoor.Win32.Agent.delp). It beacons out with the typical Elise GET request “GET /%x/page_%02d%02d%02d%02d.html”, as documented in the Lotus Blossom paper. Another APT later abused this exact site to deliver malicious VBS (CVE-2014-6332) exploits in November of 2014 with a Lurid variant payload. And that same group also served a malicious PDF exploit (CVE-2010-2883) from this site in June 2012 as “Zawgyi Unicode Keyboard.pdf”. Even earlier than that, they spearphished with that same PDF exploit object later hosted on the website under different file names. In November 2011, they used filenames appropriate for their spearphishing targets with this exploit like “台灣安保協會「亞太區域安全與台海和平」國際研討會邀 請 函_20110907.pdf” (“Taiwan Security Association International Seminar Invitation – the Asia-Pacific regional security and peace in the Taiwan Strait”), “china-central_asia.pdf”, “hydroelectric sector.pdf”, and various governmental related proposals. In this case, there was unexpected overlap from two APT. Another interesting technique that we observed in use against government targets was a campaign that lured recipients to a site redirecting users to a spoofed Flash installer site.This site in turn redirected users to a Flash installer bundled with the common Elise backdoor, eventually communicating with 210.175.53.24 and its usual “GET /14111121/page_321111234.html HTTP/1.0”. hxxp://www.bkav2010.net/support/flashplayer/downloads.html → redirected to hxxp://96.47.234.246/support/flashplayer/install_flashplayer.exe (Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.ilbq) While this particular actor effectively used their almost worn out CVE-2012-0158 exploits in the past, Spring Dragon employs more involved and creative intrusive activity as well.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "Chinese cyberspies targeted two Russian defense institutes and possibly another research facility in Belarus, according to Check Point Research. The new campaign, dubbed Twisted Panda, is part of a larger, state-sponsored espionage operation that has been ongoing for several months, if not nearly a year, according to the security shop. In a technical analysis, the researchers detail the various malicious stages and payloads of the campaign that used sanctions-related phishing emails to attack Russian entities, which are part of the state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec Corporation. Check Point Research also noted that around the same time that they observed the Twisted Panda attacks, another Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group Mustang Panda was observed exploiting the invasion of Ukraine to target Russian organizations.In fact, Twisted Panda may have connections to Mustang Panda or another Beijing-backed spy ring called Stone Panda, aka APT10, according to the security researchers. In addition to the timing of the attacks, other tools and techniques used in the new campaign overlap with China-based APT groups, they wrote. Because of this, the researchers attributed the new cyberspying operation \"with high confidence to a Chinese threat actor.\" During the the course of the research, the security shop also uncovered a similar loader that contained that looked like an easier variant of the same backdoor. And based on this, the researchers say they expect Twisted Panda has been active since June 2021.The new campaign started on March 23 with phishing emails sent to defense research institutes in Russia. All of them had the same subject: \"List of [target institute name] persons under US sanctions for invading Ukraine\", a malicious document attached, and contained a link to an attacker-controlled site designed to look like the Health Ministry of Russia. An email went out to an organization in Minsk, Belarus, on the same day with the subject: \"US Spread of Deadly Pathogens in Belarus\". Additionally, all of the attached documents looked like official Russian Ministry of Health documents with the official emblem and title.Downloading the malicious document drops a sophisticated loader that not only hides its functionality, but also avoids detection of suspicious API calls by dynamically resolving them with name hashing. By using DLL sideloading, which Check Point noted is \"a favorite evasion technique used by multiple Chinese actors,\" the malware evades anit-virus tools. The researchers cited PlugX malware, used by Mustang Panda, and a more recent APT10 global espionage campaign that used the VLC player for side-loading. In this case of the Twisted Panda campaign, \"the actual running process is valid and signed by Microsoft,\" according to the analysis. According to the security researchers, the loader contains two shellcodes. The first one runs the persistence and cleanup script. And the second is a multi-layer loader. \"The goal is to consecutively decrypt the other three fileless loader layers and eventually load the main payload in memory,\" Check Point Research explained.The main payload is a previously undocumented Spinner backdoor, which uses two types of obfuscations. And while the backdoor is new, the researchers noted that the obfuscation methods have been used together in earlier samples attributed to Stone Panda and Mustang Panda. These are control-flow flattening, which makes the code flow non-linear, and opaque predicates, which ultimately causes the binary to perform needless calculations. \"Both methods make it difficult to analyze the payload, but together, they make the analysis painful, time-consuming, and tedious,\" the security shop said. The Spinner backdoor's main purpose is to run additional payloads sent from a command-and-control server, although the researchers say they didn't intercept any of these other payloads. However, \"we believe that selected victims likely received the full backdoor with additional capabilities,\" they noted.The victims — research institutes that focus on developing electronic warfare systems, military-specialized onboard radio-electronic equipment, avionics systems for civil aviation, and medical equipment and control systems for energy, transportation, and engineering industries — also tie the Twisted Panda campaign to China's five-year plan, which aims to expand the country's scientific and technical capabilities. And, as the FBI has warned [PDF], the Chinese government isn't above using cyberespionage and IP theft to accomplish these goals. As Check Point Research concluded: \"Together with the previous reports of Chinese APT groups conducting their espionage operations against the Russian defense and governmental sector, the Twisted Panda campaign described in this research might serve as more evidence of the use of espionage in a systematic and long-term effort to achieve Chinese strategic objectives in technological superiority and military power.\"",

        "explain": "A Chinese cyber-espionage group has targeted Israeli organizations in a campaign that began in January 2019, and during which the group often used false flags in attempts to disguise as an Iranian threat actor. Detailed in a report published today by security firm Mandiant, the attacks targeted Israeli government institutions, IT companies, and telecommunication providers. The attackers, which Mandiant said it was tracking under a codename of UNC215, typically breached organizations by targeting Microsoft SharePoint servers unpatched for the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability. Once UNC215 gained access to one of these servers, they deployed the WHEATSCAN tool to scan the victim's internal network and then installed the FOCUSFJORD web shell and HYPERBRO backdoor on key servers as a way to ensure persistence on the hacked organizations' networks.Mandiant said the group took great care and several steps to hide their intrusions and minimize forensic evidence on a victim's network, such as removing malware artifacts once they were not needed and using legitimate software to perform malicious operations.Furthermore, the group also used false flags inside their malware source code in an attempt to hide their real identities. Mandiant said UNC215 often used file paths mentioning Iran (i.e., C:\\Users\\Iran) or error messages written in Arabic (i.e., 'ضائع' – which translates to: lost or missing) In addition, on at least three occasions, UNC215 also used an Iranian hacking tool that was leaked on Telegram in 2019 (i.e., the SEASHARPEE web shell). However, Mandiant researchers said that despite these indicators, the UNC215 group has been conducting cyber-espionage operations of interest to the Chinese state since at least 2014. Moreover, the attacks against Israeli targets are part of a larger espionage campaign during which UNC215 targeted a broader set of victims across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and North America, with targets typically in the government, technology, telecommunications, defense, finance, entertainment, and health care sectors. But while the Mandiant research team attributed these hacks to the UNC2015 group, the company said it's currently investigating the possibility that UNC2015 might be associated with a larger Chinese cyber-espionage group known as APT27 or Emissary Panda, a group which security firm Cybereason also recently spotted attacking telcos across Southeast Asia.",

        "explain": "Proofpoint researchers have identified a phishing campaign originating from an email address (ukr[.]net) that appears to belong to a compromised Ukranian armed service member. This discovery comes on the heels of alerts by the Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) and the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine about widespread phishing campaigns targeting private email accounts of Ukrainian armed service members by ‘UNC1151’, which Proofpoint tracks as part of TA445. The email observed by Proofpoint may represent the next stage of these attacks. The email included a malicious macro attachment which utilized social engineering themes pertaining to the Emergency Meeting of the NATO Security Council held on February 23, 2022. The email also contained a malicious attachment which attempted to download malicious Lua malware named SunSeed and targeted European government personnel tasked with managing transportation and population movement in Europe. While Proofpoint has not definitively attributed this campaign to the threat actor TA445, researchers acknowledge that the timeline, use of compromised sender addresses aligning with Ukrainian government reports, and the victimology of the campaign align with published TA445 tactics to include the targeting and collection around refugee movement in Europe. Proofpoint assesses that, in light of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, actions by proxy actors like TA445 will continue to target European governments to gather intelligence around the movement of refugees from Ukraine and on issues of importance to the Russian government. TA445, which appears to operate out of Belarus, specifically has a history of engaging in a significant volume of disinformation operations intended to manipulate European sentiment around the movement of refugees within NATO countries. These controlled narratives may intend to marshal anti-refugee sentiment within European countries and exacerbate tensions between NATO members, decreasing Western support for the Ukrainian entities involved in armed conflict. This approach is a known factor within the hybrid warfare model employed by the Russian military and by extension that of Belarus. On February 24, 2022, Proofpoint detected an email originating from a ukr[.]net email address which was sent to a European government entity. The email utilized the subject \"IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED 24.02.2022\" and included a macro enabled XLS file titled “list of persons.xlsx,” which was later determined to deliver SunSeed malware. The social engineering lure utilized in this phishing campaign were very timely, following a NATO Security Council meeting on February 23, 2022 and a news story about a Russian government “kill list” targeting Ukrainians that began circulating in Western media outlets on February 21, 2022. The format of the subject included the date “24.02.2022” at the end of subject line and was superficially similar to emails reported by the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP) on February 25, 2022. This alert indicated that mass phishing campaigns were targeting “Citizens’ e-mail addresses” in Ukraine. The timing of the Proofpoint observed campaign is notable as it occurred within close proximity to the campaigns reported by Ukrainian state agencies. Open-source research on the sender email address identified the account on a Ukrainian public procurement document for a Stihl lawn mower in 2016. The email account was listed as the contact address on the purchase, while the customer was listed as “Військова частина А2622” or military unit A2622. This title, as well as the address listed, appear to refer to a military barracks that houses a military unit in “Чернігівська область” or the Chernihiv region of Ukraine. While Proofpoint has not definitively determined that this detected campaign is aligned with the phishing campaigns reported by the Ukrainian government or that this activity can be attributed to TA445, researchers assess that this may represent a continuation of the campaigns that utilize compromised Ukrainian personal accounts of armed service members to target the governments of NATO members in Europe. The malicious XLS attachment observed in the email was laden with a simple but distinct macro. When enabled, it executes a VB macro named “Module1” which creates a Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) object invoking Windows Installer to call out to an actor-controlled staging IP and download a malicious MSI package. It also sets a Microsoft document UILevel equal to “2” which specifies a user interface level of “completely silent installation.” This hides all macro actions and network connections from the user. The actor accesses the delivery IP via the Microsoft Installer InstallProduct method which is intended to obtain an MSI install file from a URL, save it to a cached location, and finally begin installation of the MSI package. Since the actor is utilizing an MSI package as an installer for a Lua-based malware, this method is well suited to be deployed via a malicious macro-laden document delivered via phishing. Analysis of the actor-controlled delivery infrastructure identified an MSI package which installed a series of Lua-based dependencies, executed a malicious Lua script that Proofpoint has dubbed SunSeed, and established persistence via an LNK file installed for autorun at Windows Startup. This file, named qwerty_setup.msi, was previously identified publicly by security researcher Colin Hardy in response to Proofpoint’s initial content regarding this threat. The package installs 12 legitimate Lua dependencies, a Windows Lua interpreter, a malicious Lua script (SunSeed), and a Windows shortcut LNK file for persistence. Notably, the legitimate Windows Lua interpreter sppsvc.exe has been modified so it does not print any output to the Windows Console. This is likely an effort to conceal the malware installation from the infected user. All files, except for the LNK file, are installed to the folder C:\\ProgramData\\.security- soft\\. The LNK persistence script, which executes the SunSeed command “print.lua” via the Window Lua interpreter, is saved to the directory C:\\ProgramData\\.security soft\\sppsvc.exe to be executed at startup. This executes the malicious SunSeed Lua script “print.lua” that attempts to retrieve additional malicious Lua code from the actor command and control (C2) server.Proofpoint researchers observed several distinct and unusual aspects about the MSI package upon closer inspection. The actor utilized the Japanese Shift-JIS code base, resulting in a Japanese language installation message upon launching the MSI package. This may be a rudimentary false flag intended to conceal the spoken language of the threat actor. Additionally, examination of the cryptography calls made by the package during installation indicates that the MSI file appears to have been created using a dated version of WiX Toolset version 3.11.0.1528. This is an open-source software that allows users to “build MSIs without requiring additional software on a build server” from the command line. This version was last updated in 2017 with a more recent update being pushed in 2019 and an entirely new version of the toolset made available in May 2021.Based on decoding of the SunSeed print.lua malicious second stage payload script, it appears to be a simple downloader which obtains the C Drive partition serial number from the host, appends to a URL request via a Lua socket, consistently pings the C2 server for additional Lua code, and executes the code upon receiving it within a response. At the time of analysis, Proofpoint did not receive additional Lua code from the C2 server. However, researchers believe that this is likely intended to deliver subsequent stage payloads to the infected host. Further attempts to decode the SunSeed Lua host included several notable strings that may suggest a possible response from the actor-controlled server. These strings do not appear to be part of the initial SunSeed script’s functionality in the absence of a C2 server response. Observed string values include, but are not limited to:The SunSeed malware when executed issues GET requests over HTTP via port 80 using a Lua Socket. The requests are issued to the C2 server every three seconds anticipating a response. The malware specifies the user agent as “LuaSocket 2.0.2” and appends the infected target’s C Drive partition serial number to the URI request. This is a unique decimal digit value assigned to a drive upon creation of the file system. It may be an attempt by actors to track infected victims on the backend per their unique serial number. Additionally, this may allow operators to be selective about which infections are issued a next stage payload response. Based on the observed strings in the Lua script, researchers speculate that the server response may include further malicious commands, or a Lua based installer code which is executed as a response to the SunSeed payload, depending on the received serial identification number.With the finite data set available to Proofpoint surrounding this campaign, limited conclusions can be drawn regarding targeting. The Proofpoint-observed email messages were limited to European governmental entities. The targeted individuals possessed a range of expertise and professional responsibilities. However, there was a clear preference for targeting individuals with responsibilities related to transportation, financial and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe. This campaign may represent an attempt to gain intelligence regarding the logistics surrounding the movement of funds, supplies, and people within NATO member countries. Several temporal and anecdotal indicators exist which suggest that this activity aligns with reported campaigns by the threat actor TA445/UNC1151/Ghostwriter. However, Proofpoint has not yet observed concrete technical overlaps which would allow us to definitively attribute this campaign to this actor. In addition to the notable overlaps with Ukrainian government reported campaigns referenced previously, the victimology of this campaign with prominent NATO governments being targeted and a possible focus on the movements of refugees in NATO countries recalls historic motivations of TA445’s information operations circa 2021. Specifically, the anti-migratory narratives disseminated by the group also referred to as Ghostwriter during the 2021 migratory crisis in which Belarus intentionally funneled refugees to the Polish border belies a possible connection between this 2022 campaign and TA445’s historic mandate. Mainly both campaigns may indicate the weaponization of migrants and refugees of war through a hybrid information warfare and targeted cyber-attack model. Researchers at Mandiant addressed these tactics by UNC1151’s information operation team referred to as Ghostwriter (collectively TA445) in a recent presentation (12:17 time stamp), disclosing the existence of the group and attributing the activity to Belarus. Proofpoint also notes that, in addition to the Asylum Ambuscade operation, in recent days researchers have detected TA445 credential harvesting activity that aligns with Mandiant’s description of this threat group to include the use of GoPhish to deliver malicious email content. This activity appears distinct from the Asylum Ambuscade campaign. Proofpoint is currently tracking the actor responsible for Asylum Ambuscade as distinct from TA445 until a technical relationship can be further established.While Proofpoint has not definitively determined attribution at this time, researchers assess with moderate confidence that this campaign and a historic campaign from July 2021 were conducted by the same threat actor. The July 2021 campaign utilized a highly similar macro-laden XLS attachment to deliver MSI packages that install a Lua malware script. Similarly, the campaign utilized a very recent government report as the basis of the social engineering content and titled the malicious attachment “list of participants of the briefing.xls.” In addition to the file name being quite similar to the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, the Lua script created a nearly identical URI beacon to the SunSeed sample, which was composed of the infected victim’s C Drive partition serial number. Analysis of the cryptography calls in both samples revealed that the same version of WiX 3.11.0.1528 had been utilized to create the MSI packages. Finally, the macros in this historic campaign utilized the identical technique as the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, using Windows Installer to retrieve an MSI package from an actor-controlled IP resource and suppressing indications of installation from the user. The July 2021 campaign targeted senior cyber security practitioners and decisionmakers at private US-based companies, including those in the defense sector.This activity, independent of attribution conclusions, represents an effort to target NATO entities with compromised Ukrainian military accounts during an active period of armed conflict between Russia, its proxies, and Ukraine. In publishing this report, Proofpoint seeks to balance the accuracy of responsible reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of actionable intelligence. The onset of hybrid conflict, including within the cyber domain, has accelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time that defenders have to answer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known nation-state operators. However, these are issues that Proofpoint will continue to research while protecting customers globally. Proofpoint invites additional details and input around any observed activity that aligns with these reports. While the utilized techniques in this campaign are not groundbreaking individually, if deployed collectively, and during a high tempo conflict, they possess the capability to be quite effective. As the conflict continues, researchers assess similar attacks against governmental entities in NATO countries are likely. Additionally, the possibility of exploiting intelligence around refugee movements in Europe for disinformation purposes is a proven part of Russian and Belarussian-state techniques. Being aware of this threat and disclosing it publicly are paramount for cultivating awareness among targeted entities.",

        "explain": "Through Mandiant investigation of intrusions, the FLARE Advanced Practices team observed a group we track as UNC1945 compromise managed service providers and operate against a tailored set of targets within the financial and professional consulting industries by leveraging access to third-party networks (see this blog post for an in-depth description of “UNC” groups). UNC1945 targeted Oracle Solaris operating systems, utilized several tools and utilities against Windows and Linux operating systems, loaded and operated custom virtual machines, and employed techniques to evade detection. UNC1945 demonstrated access to exploits, tools and malware for multiple operating systems, a disciplined interest in covering or manipulating their activity, and displayed advanced technical abilities during interactive operations. Mandiant discovered and reported to Oracle Oracle's CVE-2020-14871, which was addressed in October 2020 Critical Patch Update. Mandiant recommends staying current on all current patch updates to ensure a high security posture. We will discuss this vulnerability in greater detail in a follow up blog post.The threat actor demonstrated experience and comfort by utilizing unique tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) within Unix environments, demonstrating a high level of acumen in conjunction with ease of operability in Microsoft Windows operating systems. They were successful navigating multiple segmented networks and leveraging third-party access to extend operations well beyond the initial victim. Furthermore, UNC1945 operated from several virtual machines pre-configured with post-exploitation tools in addition to their custom toolset to evade detection and forensics. In late 2018, UNC1945 gained access to a Solaris server and installed a backdoor we track as SLAPSTICK in order to capture connection details and credentials to facilitate further compromise. The SSH service of this server was exposed to the internet at the time, the same time we observed first evidence of threat activity. Unfortunately, due to insufficient available evidence, the next indication of activity was in mid-2020 at which time a different Solaris server was observed connecting to the threat actor infrastructure. This indicates a dwell time of approximately 519 days based on recovered artifacts. The threat actor used a Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module backdoor we refer to as SLAPSTICK to establish a foothold on a Solaris 9 server. This facilitated user access to the system with a secret hard-coded password and allowed the threat actors to escalate privileges and maintain persistence (see Figure 1). At the initial victim, UNC1945 placed a copy of a legitimate pam_unix.so file and SLAPSTICK in the /lib64/security folder. A day later, the threat actor positioned a custom Linux backdoor, which Mandiant named LEMONSTICK, on the same workstation. LEMONSTICK capabilities include command execution, file transfer and execution, and the ability to establish tunnel connections. (see Figure 2).UNC1945 obtained and maintained access to their external infrastructure using an SSH Port Forwarding mechanism despite the host lacking accessibility to the internet directly. SSH Port Forwarding is a mechanism implemented in SSH protocol for transporting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection (tunneling). This feature can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications traversing firewalls or with malicious intent to access internal networks from the the internet. The UNC1945 configurations we observed are similarly structured with respect to the host alias, specified options, and option order (see Figure 3). As part of this multi-stage operation, UNC1945 dropped a custom QEMU Virtual Machine (VM) on multiple hosts, which was executed inside of any Linux system by launching a ‘start.sh’ script. The script contained TCP forwarding settings that could be used by the threat actor in conjunction with the SSH tunnels to give direct access from the threat actor VM to the command and control server to obfuscate interaction with customer infrastructure. The VM was running a version of the Tiny Core Linux OS with pre-loaded scripts and tools. Also, we analyzed the Virtual Machine file system timestamps, which coincided with UNC1945's overall operational timeline. The VM contained numerous tools such as network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance tools. Tiny Core Linux pre-loaded tools included Mimikatz, Powersploit, Responder, Procdump, CrackMapExec, PoshC2, Medusa, JBoss Vulnerability Scanner and more. Efforts to decrease operational visibility included placing tool and output files within temporary file system mount points that were stored in volatile memory. Additionally, UNC1945 used built-in utilities and public tools to modify timestamps and selectively manipulate Unix log files. UNC1945 employed anti-forensics techniques with the use of a custom ELF utility named LOGBLEACH. The actor used built-in Linux commands to alter the timestamps of files and directories and used LOGBLEACH to clean logs to thwart forensic analysis, as seen in Figure 4. To further obfuscate activity, a Linux ELF packer named STEELCORGI was executed in memory on the Solaris system. The malware contains various anti-analysis techniques, including anti-debugging, anti-tracing, and string obfuscation. It uses environment variables as a key to unpack the final payload.After successfully establishing a foothold, UNC1945 collected credentials, escalated privileges, and successfully moved laterally through multiple networks. UNC1945 obtained credentials via SLAPSTICK and open source tools such as Mimikatz, which enabled easy lateral movement throughout networks to obtain immediate access to other segments of the network and third-party environments. Stolen credentials collected by SLAPSTICK were used to traverse the customer network via SSH and deploy SLAPSTICK to additional hosts. After successfully authenticating, SLAPSTICK displays a welcome message, as seen in Figure 5. UNC1945 used ProxyChains to download PUPYRAT, an open source, cross-platform multi-functional remote administration and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python. At one target, the threat actor used a virtual machine to initiate a brute-force of SSH targeting Linux and HP-UX endpoints. Beginning with seemingly random usernames and shifting to legitimate Linux and Windows accounts, the threat actor successfully established SSH connections on a Linux endpoint. After successfully escalating privileges on an HP-UX endpoint and a Linux endpoint, UNC1945 installed three backdoors: SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO. We observed UNC1945 use IMPACKET with SMBEXEC in a Microsoft Windows environment to execute commands remotely without the need to upload a payload to the target. SMBEXEC allows the threat actor to operate like PsExec, but without using RemComSvc. There are two main modes of using this tool that benefits attackers. Share mode allows the specification of a share that everything will be executed through. Server mode permits the output of the executed commands to be sent back by the target machine into a locally shared folder.At one victim, we observed UNC1945 moving laterally via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to a Windows server before viewing the Server Manager Panel, viewing and modifying RDP-related system firewall rules and checking the application settings of two endpoint security services.Mandiant investigations found that the threat actor maintains various tools to interact with victim networks. In addition to custom tools, the UNC1945 VMs contained various tools (e.g. network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance; see Associated Tools and Malware section). In some intrusions, UNC1945 employed a SPARC executable identified as a reconnaissance tool. Based on publicly available information, this executable could be referred to as Luckscan or BlueKeep, the latter of which is part of the BKScan toolkit (see Figure 6).According to open sources, BlueKeep, aka “bkscan” scanner, works both unauthenticated and authenticated (i.e. when Network Level Authentication is enabled). BlueKeep (CVE 2019-0708) is a security vulnerability that was discovered in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation, which allows for the possibility of remote code execution. Despite this multi-staged operation, Mandiant did not observe evidence of data exfiltration and was unable to determine UNC1945's mission for most of the intrusions we investigated. In at least one case, we observed ROLLCOAST ransomware deployment in the final phase of the threat actor activity, but Mandiant didn’t attribute this activity to UNC1945. At this time, it is likely that access to the victim environment was sold to another group. The ease and breadth of exploitation in which UNC1945 conducted this campaign suggests a sophisticated, persistent actor comfortable exploiting various operating systems, and access to resources and numerous toolsets. Given the aforementioned factors, use of zero-day exploits and virtual machines, and ability to traverse multiple third-party networks, Mandiant expects this motivated threat actor to continue targeted operations against key industries while taking advantage of operating systems that likely have inadequate security visibility. EVILSUN is a remote exploitation tool that gains access to Solaris 10 and 11 systems of SPARC or i386 architecture using a vulnerability (CVE-2020-14871) exposed by SSH keyboard-interactive authentication. The remote exploitation tool makes SSH connections to hosts passed on the command line. The default port is the normal SSH port (22), but this may be overridden. EVILSUN passes the banner string SSH-2.0-Sun_SSH_1.1.3 over the connection in clear text as part of handshaking. LEMONSTICK is a Linux executable command line utility with backdoor capabilities. The backdoor can execute files, transfer files, and tunnel connections. LEMONSTICK can be started in two different ways: passing the `-c` command line argument (with an optional file) and setting the ‘OCB’ environment variable. When started with the `-c` command line argument, LEMONSTICK spawns an interactive shell. When started in OCB mode, LEMONSTICK expects to read from STDIN. The STDIN data is expected to be encrypted with the blowfish algorithm. After decrypting, it dispatches commands based on the name —for example: ‘executes terminal command’, ‘connect to remote system’, ‘send & retrieve file’, ‘create socket connection’.LOGBLEACH is an ELF utility that has a primary functionality of deleting log entries from a specified log file(s) based on a filter provided via command line. The following log files are hard coded in the malware, but additional log paths may be specified: OKSOLO is a publicly available backdoor that binds a shell to a specified port. It can be compiled to support password authentication or dropped into a root shell. OPENSHACKLE is a reconnaissance tool that collects information about logged-on users and saves it to a file. OPENSHACKLE registers Windows Event Manager callback to achieve persistence. ProxyChains allows the use of SSH, TELNET, VNC, FTP and any other internet application from behind HTTP (HTTPS) and SOCKS (4/5) proxy servers. This \"proxifier\" provides proxy server support to any application. PUPYRAT (aka Pupy) is an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function RAT (Remote Administration Tool) and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python. It features an all-in-memory execution guideline and leaves very low footprint. It can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes (reflective injection), and load remote Python code, Python packages and Python C extensions from memory. STEELCORGI is a packer for Linux ELF programs that uses key material from the executing environment to decrypt the payload. When first starting up, the malware expects to find up to four environment variables that contain numeric values. The malware uses the environment variable values as a key to decrypt additional data to be executed. SLAPSTICK is a Solaris PAM backdoor that grants a user access to the system with a secret, hard-coded password. TINYSHELL is a lightweight client/server clone of the standard remote shell tools (rlogin, telnet, ssh, etc.), which can act as a backdoor and provide remote shell execution as well as file transfers.

        "original_label": "true",

        "explain": "The world is currently living through an exceptional situation due to the current Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. To try to stop the spread of the virus, a large number of companies all over the world have started a new regime of telework. This circumstance has significantly increased the attack surface, representing a great challenge for companies when it comes to cybersecurity, as they need to establish protocols and follow a series of measures to ensure that their business and IT systems work properly. However, the increased attack surface isn’t the only cyber-risk that has emerged in the last few days; many cybercriminals are actively taking advantage of this global uncertainty to carry out phishing campaigns, spread malware, and endanger many companies’ cybersecurity. Towards the end of last week, an APT group, called “Vicious Panda”, was discovered carrying out a spear phishing campaign that exploited the pandemic to spread its malware. The emails claim to contain information about coronavirus, but in fact contain two malicious RTF (Rich Text Format) files. If the victim opens these files, a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is launched, which is capable of taking screenshots, creating lists of files and directories on the victim’s computer, as well as downloading files, along with other capabilities. So far, the campaign has been seen targeting Mongolia’s public sector, and it seems to be the latest attack in a continuing Chinese operation against various governments and organizations around the world. This time, the special feature of the campaign is its use of the novel world situation to try to infect its victims. The email is designed to look like it comes from the Mongolian Foreign Ministry and claims to contain information about the number of people infected by the virus. To weaponize this file, the attackers used RoyalRoad, a popular tool among Chinese threat actors, which allows them to create custom documents with embedded objects, which can exploit vulnerabilities in Equation Editor, the tool used to create complex equations in Word.Once the victim opens the malicious RTF files, a vulnerability in Microsoft Word is exploited to download a malicious file (intel.wll) to the startup folder of Word (%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Word\\STARTUP). With this technique, not only do they gain persistence, but they also stop the whole infection chain from detonating if it is being run in a sandbox, since Word needs to be relaunched to fully run the malware. The intel.wll file then downloads a DLL file, which is used to download the malware and to communicate with the cyberattacker’s C2 server. The black hat only operates the C2 server for a limited period each day, which makes it harder to analyze and access the most advanced parts of the infection chain. Despite this, researchers have been able to see that the first stage of this chain downloads and decrypts the RAT once it receives the command, and also downloads the DLL, which is loaded into memory. The architecture, which is similar to a plugin, suggests that there are other modules, in addition to the payload seen in this campaign.This malware campaign has many tricks to get onto its victims’ systems and to endanger their cybersecurity once it is in. To protect against such campaigns, it is important to follow a series of measures. The first of these is extremely important: it is vital to be careful when receiving emails. Email is one of the main attack vectors, and it also one that companies cannot do without. If you receive an email from someone you don’t know, don’t open it, and above all, don’t open any attachments or click on any links. This attack uses a vulnerability in Word to endanger its victims’ cybersecurity. In fact, unpatched vulnerabilities are the cause of many cyberattacks, and they also cause a great deal of data breaches, along with other security issues. This is why it is so important to apply the relevant patch as soon as possible. To remedy these problems, Panda Security has a solution specifically designed to help identify, manage and install patches. Panda Patch Management automatically searches for the patches needed to keep your company’s computers safe, prioritizing the most urgent updates and scheduling their installation. Pending patches are reported even in exploit and malware detections. Panda Patch Management immediately launches the installation of these patches and updates, or they can be scheduled from the console, isolating the computer if necessary. This way, you can manage patches and updates to ensure that your company can run smoothly. And you’ll complete your protection system to shield your assets. Find out more about Panda Patch Management here. Unfortunately, this cyberattack will not be the last to take advantage of the current global situation to jeopardize organizations’ cybersecurity. Protect your organization by taking precautions and using advanced cybersecurity solutions such as those provided by Panda Security.",

        "original_label": "true",
        "label": "true",
        "explain": "A webshell called BumbleBee has taken flight in an ongoing xHunt espionage campaign that has targeted Microsoft Exchange servers at Kuwaiti organizations. According to researchers at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42, BumbleBee (so named because of its color scheme) was observed being used to upload and download files to and from a compromised Exchange server back in September. “We found BumbleBee hosted on an internal Internet Information Services (IIS) web server on the same network as the compromised Exchange server, as well as on two internal IIS web servers at two other Kuwaiti organizations,” researchers explained in a Monday blog.Analysis showed that the attackers used VPN access to directly talk to BumbleBee, frequently switching between different VPN servers that appeared to be from different countries, including Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This hodgepodge approach was also borne out in the rotation of different operating systems and browsers, specifically Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome on Windows 10, Windows 8.1 or Linux systems, the firm found. “We believe this is an attempt to evade detection and make analysis of the malicious activities more difficult,” Unit 42 researchers noted. “This [also] suggests the actor has access to multiple systems and uses this to make analysis of the activities more difficult, or that there are multiple actors involved, who have differing preferences for operating systems and browsers.” BumbleBee was also used in lateral-movement efforts, running commands from the attackers to discover additional systems. And indeed, the researchers discovered additional BumbleBee webshells hosted on internal IIS web servers that are not connected to the internet at all three Kuwaiti organizations. The cyberattackers used SSH tunnels to interact with these, created using the PuTTY Link (Plink) tool. “We observed the actor using Plink to create an SSH tunnel for TCP port 3389, which suggests that the actor used the tunnel to access the system using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),” researchers wrote. “We also observed the actor creating SSH tunnels to internal servers for TCP port 80, which suggests the actor used the tunnel to access internal IIS web servers. We believe that the actor accessed these additional internal IIS web servers to leverage file uploading functionality in internal web applications to install BumbleBee as a method of lateral movement.”Looking deeper into the web shell, Unit 42 found that BumbleBee requires an attacker to supply one password to view the web shell, and a second password to interact with it. “The actor must [first] provide a password in a URL parameter named parameter,” according to the firm. “Otherwise, the form used to interact with BumbleBee will not display in the browser. To check the supplied password for authentication, the web shell will generate an MD5 hash of the parameter value and check it with a hardcoded MD5 hash.” Once the operators are able to access BumbleBee, it provides three main functionalities: Executing commands, and uploading and downloading files from the compromised server. “To carry out any of these functions, the actor must supply a second password,” researchers wrote. “The BumbleBee web shell will generate an MD5 hash of the password and check it with a hardcoded MD5 hash before carrying out the functionality.”In looking at the IIS server logs and other logs from the Exchange server, the researchers were able to observe the HTTP POST requests generated when the attackers issued commands via BumbleBee. After some additional analysis, researchers were able to piece together a fuller picture of what BumbleBee is specifically used for. “The actor spent three hours and 37 minutes on Sept. 16, 2020, running commands via the BumbleBee web shell installed on the [first] compromised Exchange server,” according to the analysis. The activities included performing network discovery using ping and net group commands, as well as PowerShell to find additional computers on the network; and, performing account discovery using the whoami and quser commands. The attackers also determined the system time using the W32tm and time commands; and created an SSH tunnel using Plink to a remote host and used RDP over that SSH tunnel to control the compromised computer. They also performed lateral movement to another system by mounting a shared folder; and, finally, they removed evidence of the attack by deleting BumbleBee after they were done issuing commands. In addition to analyzing commands executed on the compromised Exchange server, Unit 42 also analyzed the commands executed on the BumbleBee web shell at an internal IIS web server hosted at one of the two other Kuwaiti organizations. “On Sept. 10, 2020, we found that the actor ran several commands to perform network and user account discovery. Additionally, the actor used BumbleBee to upload a second web shell with a filename of cq.aspx. The actor used this second web shell to run a PowerShell script that issued SQL queries to a Microsoft SQL Server database.”The the known xHunt threat group, which was first discovered in 2018 and has previously launched an array of attacks targeting the Kuwait government, as well as shipping and transportation organizations, has steadily updated its arsenal of tools, all in the service of spying on their targets. The most recent campaign stretched back to February, when xHunt compromised an Exchange server via Outlook Web App using compromised credentials. “The actor used the search functionality within Outlook Web App to search for email addresses, including searching for the domain name of the compromised Kuwaiti organization to get a full list of email addresses, as well as specific keywords, such as helpdesk,” researchers explained. “We also saw the actor viewing emails in the compromised account’s inbox, specifically emails from service providers and technology vendors. Additionally, the actor viewed alert emails from a Symantec product and Fortinet’s FortiWeb product.” This searching for emails to the helpdesk and viewing security alert emails suggests that xHunt was keeping abreast of whether the Kuwaiti organization had noticed malicious activity. “The attempts to conceal their location and the focus on viewing emails that might notify administrators of the compromised network of the attacker’s presence may explain how the actor was able to maintain a presence on the compromised network for many months,” the researchers noted.",

The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several former USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Zebrocy tool, which we have previously analyzed. A smaller subset of the delivery documents delivered Cannon or a Zebrocy Delphi variant as reported by ESET. Since we began tracking the use of Zebrocy going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool. Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Sofacy group, the use of Zebrocy in attack campaigns is far more widespread.As alluded to in our previous blog regarding the Cannon tool, the Sofacy group (AKA Fancy Bear, APT28, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, Sednit) has persistently attacked various government and private organizations around the world from mid-October 2018 through mid-November 2018. The majority of targets were NATO-aligned nation states, although several former USSR nation states were also targeted. The attacks primarily deployed variants of the Zebrocy tool, which we have previously analyzed. A smaller subset of the delivery documents delivered Cannon or a Zebrocy Delphi variant as reported by ESET. Since we began tracking the use of Zebrocy going back to mid-2015, we have observed a significant increase in frequency of deployment of this tool. Compared to other backdoor tools associated with the Sofacy group, the use of Zebrocy in attack campaigns is far more widespread.Beginning on October 17, 2018, we collected a total of nine delivery documents sent to a multitude of organizations around the world. The targets included a foreign affairs organization in North America, foreign affairs organizations in Europe, as well as government entities in former USSR states. We also discovered evidence of possible targeting of local law enforcement agencies around the world, covering North America, Australia, and Europe. Our telemetry also showed possible targeting of NGOs, marketing firms, as well as organizations in the medical industry. The attack vector of these attacks was all via spear-phishing, using email accounts registered to the free email provider Seznam, a popular web services provider located in the Czech Republic. An example can be seen in Figure 1.In this campaign, the Sofacy group appears to have relied heavily on filenames to lure victims into launching the weaponized documents. Filenames ranged from topics alluding to Brexit, the Lion Air crash, and recent rocket attacks in Israel. The full list of filenames we were able to collect can be seen in Table 1. Although the filenames appeared to be highly targeted and pertinent to the victims, the actual lure content of the documents were far more generic as seen in Figure 2.In November 2018, the adversary shifted tactics and began implementing non-generic lure content for their weaponized documents. We collected three samples heavily targeting NATO-aligned nation states at this time, using three different lures as seen in Figure 3.In one of the documents, the victim is presented with what appears to be an obfuscated document with the NATO EOD seal and text alluding to the targeted nation state. Unpacking the document revealed that the unobfuscated image was a screenshot of a cover page regarding a NATO workshop in the targeted nation state. The other two documents had very similar lures to each other, presenting garbled text to the target with instructions for the victim on how to properly view the document. Interestingly, one of them contained instructions in Russian, which may indicate the intended target was a Russian speaking nation-state. Each of these weaponized documents used the same tactic for their attacks. Upon opening the document, it leveraged the ability of Microsoft Word to retrieve a remote template to then load a malicious macro document as seen in Figure 4.If the C2 server is active at the time the document is opened, it will successfully retrieve the malicious macro and load it in the same Microsoft Word session. The victim will then see a prompt to Enable Content as with any malicious macro document as seen in Figure 5. If the C2 server is not active at this time, the download will fail and the victim will not receive a prompt to Enable Content as no macro is downloaded.The delivery documents used in the October and November waves shared a large number of similarities, as seen in Table 1, which allowed us to cluster the activity together. Most notably, the author name Joohn was used repeatedly in each delivery document. There was a slight deviation in the November grouping, where the three samples we collected still used the Joohn author name for the last modified field but reverted to a default USER/user author name for the creator field.The remote template documents retrieved by the delivery documents in Table 1 also shared a common author name, using the string xxx.Table 2 shows the remote templates downloaded by delivery documents in this attack campaign. In the tables and text of this report, we are referring to samples by a shortened version of their SHA256 hash to improve readability. The full hashes and metadata are available in CSV format here.As seen in Table 1, the delivery documents accessed their respective remote templates from four C2 servers at the following IP addresses:These initial C2 IP addresses not only hosted the remote templates that subsequently load the first-stage Zebrocy or Cannon payloads, but the IP addresses also hosted the C2 server for the first-stage payloads themselves. All C2s used in the Dear Joohn campaign were IP-based and examining the infrastructure did not provide significant overlap or relationships with previous Zebrocy or Sofacy infrastructure. A visual representation of the Dear Joohn campaign can be seen in Figure 6.We created a timeline of the activity based off the data we collected, and found that the attack dates were tightly clustered into two waves in mid- to late-October and in mid-November as we see in Figure 7 using the timestamps from Table 3.Based off the timestamps we have, four delivery documents were initially created on September 11, 2018 04:22 UTC. These four were then all modified on the same date and time on October 13, 2018 08:21. Having three different C2 locations embedded inside these delivery documents while maintaining the exact same timestamping may indicate the use of an automated tool. Using a command line based penetration testing toolkit such as Phishery could allow for simple scripting to generate multiple documents all at the same time with different inputs. From there, there was an average of a two-week gap until these documents were first seen in the wild. In total, these four documents had an average of roughly 46 days from initial creation to attack. Based on the modular nature of the Dear Joohn campaign attacks, the lengthy amount of time from initial creation to attack may suggest the campaign was not yet ready for deployment due to additional development required for the remote templates, payloads, or infrastructure. Another possible scenario is that the adversary may have had a certain timeframe they desired to execute the attack, and from the timeline it is clear there were two distinct targeting time frames, one from mid to late October 2018 and the other in mid-November 2018. As the campaign progressed, the operational tempo of the Dear Joohn campaign increased, with the total time from document creation to first seen dropping down to an average of roughly two days. When comparing the provided timestamps of the delivery documents to the timestamps for the remote template documents from Table 2, we find that the time to attack is directly correlated to the last time the templates are modified. On average, there was a 13.8 hour gap between when the template document was last touched by the operator and when the delivery document is first observed in the wild. This leads us to believe that the generation of the delivery documents were indeed part of a staging effort, first with the initial creation of the document, modification to it to communicate with a C2, then generating a remote template document just prior to launching the actual attack. Analysis using timestamps is not always conclusive however. One of the documents we examined with the filename Rocket attacks on Israel.docx (SHA256: 34bdb5b364..) contained inconsistent creation and last modified timestamps, with the last modified timestamp occurring before the creation timestamp. A possible explanation for this is that the document was copied to another system with an incorrectly set system time, then saved with the incorrect time. This document was also the first of the mid-November cluster which used the user/USER author name instead of Joohn, further supporting the scenario of the document being copied between systems.The delivery documents in this attack campaign loaded remote templates whose macros installed a variety of first-stage payloads. With the notable exception of the Cannon tool, the first-stage tools are all variants of the Zebrocy Trojan. The Zebrocy variants delivered in this campaign were written in several different languages, including Delphi, C# and VB.NET. Information on the first-stage payloads delivered in this attack are listed in Table 4.The Delphi variant of Zebrocy delivered in this attack campaign are very similar to the Delphi downloader discussed in our previous Zebrocy research published in June 2018. While this Delphi variant was known, the C# and VB.NET variants delivered in this attack campaign were previously unknown. An interesting note on these payloads is that all the Delphi payloads delivered in this campaign were packed with UPX, while none of the other payloads were packed. While we can only speculate on the specific reason, it is likely Sofacy packed only the Delphi variants in an attempt to increase evasion as the Delphi variant of Zebrocy is known and has been widely analyzed. By collecting and analyzing additional Cannon samples, we believe we have also found a Cannon variant written in Delphi. We have seen Sofacy using multiple languages to create variants of the Zebrocy Trojan, so it seems fitting that the group would create additional variants of Cannon in multiple programming languages as well.Since our initial blog that introduced the Cannon tool, we were able to collect more samples of Cannon to get a better understanding of its origins. It appears that the first known sample of Cannon was created on April 18, 2018 and since then there has been at least seven additional samples. Table 5 shows the known Cannon samples, their compilation time and the email accounts used for its C2 communications.As mentioned in our initial blog, the actor controlled email address acting as the C2 was sahro.bella7[at]post.cz, but all previous samples of Cannon used sym777.g[at]post.cz. Also, all previous samples of Cannon used an account name of kae.mezhnosh to receive emails from the actor, while using the accounts vebek.morozh30, g0r7tsa45s and marvel.polezha to send emails to the actor. As we reported in our previous analysis of Cannon, the tool logs into an email account using POP3S and checks for emails with a specific filename that it will save to the system and execute. The initial sample we analyzed looked for an attachment with a filename of auddevc.txt, but other Cannon samples have looked for the following filenames instead:While searching for additional Cannon samples, we discovered another tool that used emails for its C2 communications. The initial overlap was based on the filename wmssl.exe, which was seen as an executable name that Cannon would move the wmssl.txt attachment to install and execute a secondary payload. Initial analysis indicated this may have been a tenuous connection; however, after we gathered additional samples of Delphi Cannon, we discovered additional relationships. Table 6 shows Delphi Cannon samples we gathered, including the sample 215f7c08c2.. that is very similar to the Trojan discussed in ESET’s research.The compilation times in Table 6 suggests that the Delphi variant of Cannon predates the originally reported version, as the first known Delphi sample was compiled in January 2018 and the first known Cannon sample was compiled in April 2018. The Delphi variant of Cannon does not use legitimate web-based email services for its C2 communications, instead opting to use email accounts at an actor owned domain, ambcomission[.]com. This actor controlled domain links to a larger Sofacy infrastructure as reported by ThreatConnect. Even though Delphi Cannon uses POP3S and SMTPS for its C2 communications like Cannon, it is arguably easier to defend against as it uses an actor owned domain that defenders can easily block and not a legitimate email provider such as Seznam. The oldest known sample of the Delphi variant (SHA256: 5a02d4e5f6…) provided us a much stronger linkage between this Delphi Cannon and Cannon, as this sample collects system information and sends it to the C2 email address, which includes the path of the running process appended to the string Running place. The screenshot in Figure 8 of the inf method within a Cannon sample (SHA256: 4405cfbf28...) shows the information gathered that is exfiltrated to the C2 via email, specifically with RunningPlace and LogicalDrives header strings:When comparing the two Cannon variants, we found a method within a Delphi Cannon sample (SHA256: 5a02d4e5f6...) showing the use of Running place and Logical_Drivers as header strings to the system information it is collecting and sending to the C2 via email. While not an exact match, Figure 9 shows these similar header strings and strengthens our hypothesis that the two variants are indeed related:As seen in Table 6, one of the Delphi Cannon samples (SHA256: cac630c11c..) does not have any associated email addresses, as the sample does not seem to have any C2 functionality. Instead, this sample reads “tasks” from a file named ta.bin that another unknown tool then must write to and handle C2 functionality. It is also interesting that this specific sample has the same resource name (L30) that contains the same encrypted email addresses as the other samples in Table 6 using heatlth500@ambcomission[.]com as a C2 email (such as ecc5805898..) but does not contain any code to access the resource or decrypt its contents.The VB.NET variant (SHA256: e5aece694d..) is very similar to other known Zebrocy variants. It includes the storage volume serial number within the URL it uses as its C2 beacon, which it obtains using the Scripting.FileSystemObject object to call GetDriveName from the path stored in Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData. It then uses the storage volume obtained from the GetDriveName function and calls GetDrive to get the SerialNumber of the storage device. The VB.NET variant then gathers system information and running processes like other Zebrocy variants by running the following commands:The C# variant of Zebrocy is similar to other variants in functionality, but also has several unique attributes that are worth discussing. Like other Zebrocy tools, the C# variant gathers the storage volume serial number to use in outbound beacons to the C2 server. In this particular variant, the tool uses the Windows API function GetVolumeInformation to get the serial number of the C: drive. This variant of Zebrocy also takes a screenshot that it will transmit to the C2 server in JPEG format. The most notable change to this variant of Zebrocy, other than the programming language used, is the way the tool gathers the system information and running processes. Instead of using systeminfo and tasklist commands, the C# variant of Zebrocy uses WMI queries to gather this information. The tool runs the following list of WMI queries:The Sofacy group continues their attacks on organizations across the globe using similar tactics and techniques. We observed them carrying out attacks via spear-phishing emails in late October through November, often leveraging current events within filenames to entice recipients to open the malicious attachments. The group clearly shows a preference for using a simple downloader like Zebrocy as first-stage payloads in these attacks. The group continues to develop new variations of Zebrocy by adding a VB.NET and C# version, and it appears that they also have used different variants of the Cannon tool in past attack campaigns.
