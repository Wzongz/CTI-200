It was a lot to take in at once\u2014the statement, the photo call and then their first interview together. But since most of Harry and Meghan\u2019s relationship has been kept from the spotlight, it was really nice to just see them be together.\n\nSo after watching their joint interview about seven times\u2014where we got the proposal story and the truth behind how they met\u2014we were thrilled to discover that there is even more footage from the chat, but it\u2019s more candid and goofier. A double treat!\n\nAnd it\u2019s so gosh darn cute.\n\nThey pulled faces; they joked around; Meghan made this funny face at Harry like she was pretending to interrogate him.\n\nBasically, they laughed a lot, and it further proved that these two are made for each other.\n\nThe reporter, Mishal, said on The One Show that it was obvious Harry and Meghan are \u201cvery much in love,\u201d based on \u201cthe bond between them\u201d and their body language.\n\nFall in love with the adorable footage here:\n\nLoading the player...\n\nAnd here\u2019s what a lip-reader managed to decode from the muted footage:", "images": ["https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/Group.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/02/PFW-FROW.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/HarryMeghanRelationship_Main.jpg?resize=380%2C304&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/1692145804676_matildas-relationships-sam-kerr.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/1511919844999_GoofyPhotocall.jpg?resize=682%2C1024&ssl=1", "https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/06/meghan-markle-style-1.jpg?resize=600%2C500&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/02/sophie-wilde-cover.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/MEGHAN-DISNEY-1.jpg?resize=380%2C304&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/1511920323278_GoofyFB.jpg?resize=600%2C315&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/02/Elle-Cover.jpg?resize=731%2C1024&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/1511920323278_GoofyFB.jpg?resize=600%2C315&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Chandra", "Grace O'Neill"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com.au/culture/celebrity/prince-harry-meghan-markle-cute-interview-footage-15193/", "title": "Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Could Not Be Cuter In This Sweet, Goofy Interview Footage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were caught having some candid, goofy moments after their first official interview together talking about their engagement.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Could Not Be Cuter In This Sweet, Goofy Interview Footage", "description": "All of the heart eyes for these two.", "url": "https://www.elle.com.au/culture/celebrity/prince-harry-meghan-markle-cute-interview-footage-15193/", "site_name": "ELLE", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/1511920323278_GoofyFB.jpg?resize=600%2C315&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-29T01:40:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-12-02T14:17:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "1 minute", "label2": "Written by", "data2": "Jessica Chandra"}, "sailthru.date": "2017-11-29 01:40:19", "sailthru.title": "Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Could Not Be Cuter In This Sweet, Goofy Interview Footage", "sailthru.author": "Jessica Chandra", "sailthru.description": "<p>All of the heart eyes for these two.</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/Goofy_Main.jpg?fit=600%2C500&ssl=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/11/Goofy_Main.jpg?fit=50%2C42&ssl=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/cropped-ElleFavIcon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511919619.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com.au", "summary": ""}
