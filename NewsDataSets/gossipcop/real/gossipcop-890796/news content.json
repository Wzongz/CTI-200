All the sudden right before passing out, I felt like I was in the middle of a campfire.\"\n\nWilliams acknowledged that she may have pushed her body too far. \"I have a very, very hard work ethic,\" she admitted to her audience. She also expressed gratitude for all of the support she received.\n\n\"I want to thank you all for your tweets and your flowers and my colleagues in this game on TV, I got all of your well wishes,\" the talk show star said.\n\n(h/t E!
