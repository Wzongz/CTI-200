Now a decade later, it feels incredible to be a part of the most-viewed video on YouTube.\"\n\nWiz Khalifa added, \"I'm super excited and grateful to everyone who supported the song and video on YouTube, and happy to inspire and impact so many lives.\u201d", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/Ozempic-5-rt-jm-240228_1709146045327_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/princess-kate-gty-jef-240229_1709215117878_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/default-news-logo.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/CRFASHIONBOOK1main_1709327579958_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/amish-woman-killed_1709383557175_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "description": "It beat out former top video \"Gangnam Style.\"", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article"}, "description": "It beat out former top video \"Gangnam Style.\"", "keywords": "see you again, charlie puth, Article, 48571822", "copyright": "2024 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "lastPublishedDate": "2017-07-12T11:18:02Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,48571822", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,48571822", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "description": "It beat out former top video \"Gangnam Style.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,48571822", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,48571822", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
