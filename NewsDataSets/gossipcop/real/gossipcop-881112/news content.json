The trailer features a ton of exciting and adventurous new footage of Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft in action and kicking ass! There are actually a few moments that are pretty breathtaking. If you're not already excited about this movie, this trailer might actually do the trick and get you on board. I'm actually really impressed! This looks like it's going to be a badass film!\n\nLara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished when she was scarcely a teen. Now a young woman of 21 without any real focus or purpose, Lara navigates the chaotic streets of trendy East London as a bike courier, barely making the rent. Determined to forge her own path, she refuses to take the reins of her father\u2019s global empire just as staunchly as she rejects the idea that he\u2019s truly gone. Advised to face the facts and move forward after seven years without him, even Lara can\u2019t understand what drives her to finally solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.\n\nLeaving everything she knows behind, Lara goes in search of her dad\u2019s last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. But her mission will not be an easy one; just reaching the island will be extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Lara, who\u2014against the odds and armed with only her sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit\u2014must learn to push herself beyond her limits as she journeys into the unknown. If she survives this perilous adventure, it could be the making of her, earning her the name tomb raider.\n\nTomb Raider is being directed by Roar Uthaug (The Wave) and it also stars Walton Goggins as Father Mathias Vogel; Daniel Wu as Lu Ren, the ship captain who helps Lara in searching for her Father; Dominic West as Lord Richard Croft, Lara's deceased archaeologist father; and Hannah John-Kamen as Sophie, Croft's flatmate and best friend.\n\nThe movie hits theaters March 16th 2018.", "images": ["https://geektyrant.com/news/james-gunn-reveals-new-title-for-superman-legacy-and-official-look-at-suit-logo?format=300w", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/51ce6099e4b0d911b4489b79/5a60da6d9140b7bef6db7b75/1557985584885/alicia-vikander-kicks-ass-as-lara-croft-in-new-adventurous-trailer-for-tomb-raider-social.jpg?format=1500w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/stunning-trailer-for-kevin-costners-western-epic-horizon-an-american-saga?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/trailer-for-the-strangers-chapter-1-witness-how-the-strangers-became-the-strangers?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/trailer-for-the-survival-action-thriller-jericho-ridge-breathless-adrenaline-pumping-cinema?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/all-the-ghosts-are-unleashed-in-final-trailer-for-ghostbusters-afterlife?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/three-new-photos-for-ghostbusters-frozen-empire-spotlight-the-new-villain-and-team?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/dont-tell-mom-the-babysitters-dead-remake-teaser-trailer-featuring-june-squibb-and-nicole-richie?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/new-gi-joe-classified-figures-for-beach-head-cobra-ferret-avt-and-more-pre-orders-live-for-previously-announced-figures?format=300w", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/1516297253362-DTW6GM85Q9QCGBVCM14T/image-asset.jpeg", "https://geektyrant.com/news/wicked-awesome-action-packed-trailer-for-boy-kills-world-from-producer-sam-raimi?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/first-look-at-bill-skaarsgard-in-the-crow-reboot?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/new-trailer-for-luc-bessons-crazy-looking-action-thriller-dogman?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/fun-new-footage-for-ghostbusters-frozen-empire-featured-in-new-trailer-tv-spots-and-a-featurette?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/star-wars-the-acolyte-star-amandla-stenberg-discusses-series-setting-and-how-it-honors-the-force?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/paranormal-activity-is-finally-getting-its-first-video-game-from-the-creators-of-the-mortuary-assistant?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/disney-releases-first-look-photo-from-tron-ares?format=300w", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.geektyrant_com,DomainId.495676", "https://geektyrant.com/news/trailer-for-the-wild-supernatural-emo-horror-thriller-i-saw-the-tv-glow?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/new-trailer-for-motorcycle-club-drama-the-bikeriders?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/awesome-new-trailer-for-kaiju-no-8-which-is-hyped-as-being-the-best-anime-of-the-year?format=300w", "https://geektyrant.com/news/fun-trailer-for-the-japanese-action-comedy-baby-assassins-2?format=300w"], "top_img": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/51ce6099e4b0d911b4489b79/5a60da6d9140b7bef6db7b75/1557985584885/alicia-vikander-kicks-ass-as-lara-croft-in-new-adventurous-trailer-for-tomb-raider-social.jpg?format=1500w", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joey Paur"], "canonical_link": "https://geektyrant.com/news/alicia-vikander-kicks-ass-as-lara-croft-in-new-adventurous-trailer-for-tomb-raider", "title": "Alicia Vikander Kicks Ass as Lara Croft in New Adventurous Trailer For TOMB RAIDER \u2014 GeekTyrant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "GeekTyrant", "title": "Alicia Vikander Kicks Ass as Lara Croft in New Adventurous Trailer For TOMB RAIDER \u2014 GeekTyrant", "latitude": "34.1808392", "longitude": "-118.30896610000002", "url": "https://geektyrant.com/news/alicia-vikander-kicks-ass-as-lara-croft-in-new-adventurous-trailer-for-tomb-raider", "type": "article", "description": "We've got an awesome action-packed new trailer for the upcoming   Tomb Raider   movie for you to watch today!
