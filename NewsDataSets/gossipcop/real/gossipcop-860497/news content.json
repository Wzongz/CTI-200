It's why, naturally, I kind of lose it when I see celebs taking a break from their designer wardrobes to show off their latest affordable fashion finds, too. (Celebs\u2026 They're just like us, right?) Last week during New York Fashion Week, Kendall Jenner wore a pair of $90 earrings on repeat that hit on this fall's biggest jewelry trend\u2014and I'm pretty much sold on them now.\n\nThe simple drop earrings from Vita Fede nail the chain-link jewelry trend that we're seeing everywhere right now. From a taping of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to fashion week parties, she proved the earrings are the perfect jewelry piece for any occasion. Ahead, see how Jenner wore her trendy chain-link earrings four times in the same week, and then shop them for yourself (because I know you'll want to).\n\nOn Kendall Jenner: Tom Ford High-Rise Skinny Bugle-Beaded Jaguar-Print Velvet Pants ($6750); Vita Fede Milos Earrings ($90)\n\n(Image credit: NBC/Getty Images)\n\nOn Kendall Jenner: Paula Knorr Relief Top; Sally LaPointe sweater; Christian Louboutin So Kate Patent Leather Pumps ($725); Vita Fede Milos Earrings ($90)\n\nOn Kendall Jenner: Prada Nylon Hobo Bag; Vita Fede Milos Earrings ($90)\n\n(Image credit: Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images)\n\nOn Kendall Jenner: Prada Neon Padded Clutch ($850) and Flame Wedge Sandals ($1100); Vita Fede Milos Earrings ($90)\n\nShop her earrings:\n\nVita Fede Milos Earrings $90 SHOP NOW\n\nShop more affordable chain-link jewelry:\n\nLaura Lombardi Mini Porta Gold-Tone Earrings $110 SHOP NOW\n\nRachel Comey Dalid Chain Bracelet $135 SHOP NOW\n\nYoung Frankk Classic Chain $118 SHOP NOW\n\nWolf Circus Oval Chain Earrings in Silver $95 SHOP NOW\n\nCinco Pernille Necklace $86 SHOP NOW\n\nLizzie Fortunato Triplet Link Drop Earrings $150 $100 SHOP NOW\n\nBagatiba Abstract Bracelet $80 SHOP NOW\n\nArgento Vivo Drop Link Earrings $88 SHOP NOW\n\nJoolz by Martha Calvo Tribeca Chain Link Bracelet $88 SHOP NOW\n\nMejuri Icon Earrings $69 SHOP NOW\n\nAnk Studios Relier Chain Choker $45 SHOP NOW\n\nMango Link Necklace $30 SHOP NOW\n\nFree People Lana Link Pendant $38 SHOP NOW\n\nJules Smith Link Up Earrings $45 SHOP NOW\n\nZara Links Necklace $26 SHOP NOW\n\nUrban Outfitters Reese Chain Link Necklace $18 SHOP NOW\n\nNext up, see the latest street style from London Fashion Week.", "images": ["https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whowhatwear/missing-image.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whowhatwear/posts/267792/kendall-jenner-earrings-267792-1537204315345-square-1200-80.jpg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/whowhatwear/media/shared/img/flags/nosize/GB.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whowhatwear/posts/267792/kendall-jenner-earrings-267792-1537204315345-square-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Laplaca", "Last Updated", "Anneliese Henderson", "Kit Kilroy", "Erin Fitzpatrick", "Ana Escalante", "Allyson Payer", "Eliza Huber", "Grace O'Connell Joshua", "Social Links Navigation"], "canonical_link": "https://www.whowhatwear.com/kendall-jenner-earrings", "title": "Kendall Jenner Only Spent $90 on Fall's Biggest Earring Trend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2018-09-14T18:41:59+00:00", "description": "See how Kendall Jenner wore the same affordable earrings four times in the same week, and then shop her on-trend pair.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/xwqgbil9mt1668679725.png", "og": {"site_name": "WhoWhatWearUK", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whowhatwear/posts/267792/kendall-jenner-earrings-267792-1537204315345-square-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "title": "Kendall Jenner Only Spent $90 on Fall's Biggest Earring Trend", "url": "https://www.whowhatwear.com/kendall-jenner-earrings"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WhoWhatWearUK/", "published_time": "2018-09-14T18:41:59Z", "modified_time": "2019-08-14T17:21:30Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "9rU6NdM1QTXxyu9WpH2oP7", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-09-14T18:41:59Z", "parsely-title": "Kendall Jenner Only Spent $90 on Fall's Biggest Earring Trend", "parsely-link": "https://www.whowhatwear.com/kendall-jenner-earrings", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whowhatwear/posts/267792/kendall-jenner-earrings-267792-1537204315345-square.jpg", "parsely-section": "Jewelry", "parsely-tags": "Category: Jewelry,Category: Fashion,Category: Shopping,Category: News,Muses,Earrings,Kendall Jenner,van-hawk-only-fallback,serversidehawk,van-hawk-only-fallback", "parsely-author": "Anna LaPlaca", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@WhoWhatWearUK", "title": "Kendall Jenner Only Spent $90 on Fall's Biggest Earring Trend", "creator": "@WhoWhatWearUK", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whowhatwear/posts/267792/kendall-jenner-earrings-267792-1537204315345-square-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 3323002952}, "google-site-verification": "<meta name=\"google-site-verification\" content=\"2kYzUbjAttKASfP4gAGuVBNzi4GJfOb8RT8dUmCxjiE\" />", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.whowhatwear.com/kendall-jenner-earrings"}, "botify-site-verification": "2pzcQZFibLjk9GJgSZgweA8MU9al6utA", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536950519.0, "source": "https://www.whowhatwear.com", "summary": ""}
