Don\u2019t cry for Moynihan, he already has a new CBS sitcom lined up and with several recent appearances in big-budget comedy films, Bayer likely won\u2019t go looking either. But with 16 years of S.N.L. work between them, Bayer and Moynihan seemed owed a splashy farewell from their comedy home. And that\u2019s what they got\u2014mostly. But what happened behind the scenes may be even more revealing. A third cast member, Sasheer Zamata, also left the show Saturday without so much of a whisper of goodbye on camera.\n\nIn this week\u2019s S.N.L. finale hosted by Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, Moynihan and Bayer got much more than their usual amount of screentime with one or the other appearing in almost every single sketch. The pair also got a chance to trot out some scene-stealing characters for their last appearances on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d with Moynihan resurrecting Drunk Uncle one last time and Bayer deciding to go with a more recent character: her bubbly, incomprehensible meteorologist Dawn Lazarus. Their goodbye culminating in a not-very-steady high school graduating seniors sketch that paid homage to the departing class of 2017. However, any emotional impact this farewell may have had got a little lost in the weeds. So Moynihan and Bayer fans\u2014knowing in advance the two were leaving\u2014may have been expecting a more formal goodbye to come in the final seconds of the show as The Rock gave his thanks. Something akin to what Ben Affleck (with an assist from the camera operators) gave Bill Hader and Fred Armisen in 2013.\n\nCompare that to the scene on the stage last night where the focus was on celebrity guest stars Scarlett Johansson, Katy Perry, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, and The Rock. That\u2019s par for the course in a season that often placed a greater emphasis on celebrity impressions than highlighting the talents of its existing cast. Without rewinding, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to even find Bayer and Moynihan (let alone Zamata) in the crowd.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBut reports started circulating out of Studio 8H last night that Moynihan, Bayer, and Zamata all got a little more fanfare once the cameras stopped rolling. The effort started with Vanessa Bayer who was hoisted up and carried out by co-stars Alex Moffat and Beck Bennett.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65daad2832c4e903d77c0c6b/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921cbf90e4c8010bd72d184/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-05-21%2520at%252010.17.49%2520AM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921159c1165e3156f470724/1:1/pass/tom-hanks-david-pumpkins.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65ce1bcbffb680df1daf9003/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921d8960e4c8010bd72d186/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sasheer-zamata-snl.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65caaa4adb6e1b2a16e5050a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921cbf924f98714583f1955/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-05-21%2520at%252010.17.32%2520AM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65cb938bc1a4420099458b1e/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65d68ae0b7891fee7a081e8f/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65ca2bdf174ea0279a9b6aa5/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65db61121d7aa99545649eaf/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db9137816608815fd00dca/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss01.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59210ecd0e4c8010bd72d179/1:1/pass/snl-trump-hallelujah.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65cb78021c5822916aabf70b/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65c7c2eaf5cb8424c8003179/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-small-white.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db915e8a2fdf64645fe020/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss02.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921c7f01165e3156f47072c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bill-fred.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db92758d77134d68d3bb6a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss03.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921d8960e4c8010bd72d186/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/sasheer-zamata-snl.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921137b256b331b4fda52e8/1:1/pass/the-rock-tom-hanks-snl-president.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921d8960e4c8010bd72d186/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sasheer-zamata-snl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Joanna Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/sasheer-zamata-snl-leaving-bobby-moynihan-vanessa-bayer", "title": "Why Did a Third S.N.L.
