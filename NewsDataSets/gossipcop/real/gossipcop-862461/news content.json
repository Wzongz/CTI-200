Only a few repairs to the roof and other minor stuff.\n\nThe brand new security system they left behind probably spiked the price.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f4/16by9/2024/02/28/f4ed6ec2f74d486aaa6007b7e505a1b8_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e1/16by9/2014/10/25/e11f2eb756c650b68b30459e4519658f_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/af/16by9/2024/02/28/af0a5547cce841d281ee4304b65b79e9_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ed/16by9/2024/02/28/ed48d89ff29945dfbc49f08ee96e19d2_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/15/16by9/2015/01/16/153f949fc3f45ca9b0d33d810b5b1114_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a2/o/2015/06/19/a24a5f404dbc52deb92bc8f03ebf4558_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/9b/16by9/2015/02/13/9bbd4eab21675d37aeb926579cba5e56_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/4e/16by9/2015/06/19/4ea842c644565d0691740a88734990cf_xl.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e1/16by9/2024/02/28/e1588026a20b4b44a4fbeaa2a8ca2762_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/66/16by9/2024/02/28/66ea0badf801480f9a82355bbd6d69cd_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/4e/16by9/2015/06/19/4ea842c644565d0691740a88734990cf_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2015/06/21/honey-boo-boo-georgia-mama-june-house-sale-tlc/", "title": "'Honey Boo Boo' House Hits The Market ...
