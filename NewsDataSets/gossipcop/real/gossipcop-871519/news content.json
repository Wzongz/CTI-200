{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-ca-st-fall-preview-edie-falco-menendez-brothers-20170907-story.html", "text": "In 1989, Edie Falco paid little attention to the sensational murder case dominating the headlines involving the wealthy Menendez family.\n\n\u201cThe case was in the background of my life,\u201d says Falco, when asked about the national fascination with the brutal Beverly Hills living room slayings of entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife, Mary Louise \u201cKitty\u201d Menendez. The suspects were their sons, Lyle and Erik, who were 21 and 18, respectively, at the time of the murders.\n\n\u201cThere were other things to think about, and there were not 7,000 channels at the time,\u201d says the Brooklyn native. Her distracted impression was that it was just \u201ca couple of bratty kids that killed their rich parents.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few years shy of the crime\u2019s 30th anniversary, the case has moved to the front-line of Falco\u2019s character gallery as the acclaimed actress \u2014 who scored back-to-back triumphs with her Emmy-winning roles on \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cNurse Jackie\u201d \u2014 stars in NBC\u2019s \u201cLaw & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders,\u201d premiering Sept. 26.\n\nFalco plays no-nonsense defense attorney Leslie Abramson in the eight-episode series, which introduces a nonfiction extension to the brand created by Dick Wolf. The producer hopes the project is the first of many that can use the \u201cL&O\u201d formula to re-examine high-profile crimes such as the Hillside Strangler and Son of Sam.\n\n\u201cThere are so many of these cases I want to know a lot more about,\u201d Wolf said . The Menendez series will feature some \u201cLaw & Order\u201d hallmarks: the colorful opening logo and the \u201cchung chung\u201d between scenes.\n\n\u201cYou have to appeal to your base,\u201d Wolf said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m using every comfort zone for my audience.\u201d\n\nThe docudrama also marks the latest in a stream of Hollywood projects that reflect the ongoing interest in the scandalous murders, which centered on whether the Menendez brothers were cold-blooded murderers or victims of horrific child abuse who killed their parents to escape torment. (The brothers were sentenced to life in prison in 1996.)\n\nAmong the various Menendez projects were Lifetime\u2019s June film \u201cMenendez: Blood Brothers,\u201d which featured Courtney Love as Kitty Menendez, and two separate made-for-TV movies in 1994.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cLaw & Order\u201d version is the first to position Abramson as the central character, and it plans to offer a more extensive examination of the killings.\n\nExecutive producer and showrunner Rene Balcer believes the brothers were unfairly treated by what he called a corrupt justice system.\n\n\u201cThese guys never should have been sentenced to life without parole,\u201d Balcer said . \u201cThey were overcharged and over-sentenced. They were abused kids who killed their abusers.\u201d\n\nAlthough she had little interest at the time, Falco said she was attracted to the series by the complicated dynamics.\n\n\u201cThings are never what they seem,\u201d the actress said on location in Pasadena.\n\nJust minutes earlier, she had put on the wig that matched Abramson\u2019s famously frizzy mane. Her appearance was worlds away from that of manicured mob wife Carmela Soprano or bleary, drug-addicted nurse Jackie Peyton.\n\nPortrait of Edie Falco in Pasadena, CA July 24, 2017. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFULL COVERAGE: Fall 2017 TV preview \u00bb\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story of child abuse. That stuff hopefully affects everyone, but it really just gets me right in my gut what these boys were put through,\u201d said Falco, the mother of two young kids. \u201cThere\u2019s something more grotesque about the fact that they had money. They were not allowed to be seen as victims. People were not receptive to hearing how hard it was for them.\u201d\n\nShe was also moved by Abramson\u2019s mission to do right by the brothers.\n\n\u201cLeslie is a woman who is very good at her job,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is passionate about it and believes in her clients. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she believes they\u2019re innocent, but she believes in their right to a fair defense. That\u2019s commendable of her. I think she really cared about these guys, beyond working for them.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Falco was on the steps of an office building substituting for the Beverly Hills Courthouse, surrounded by extras playing reporters at a brief news conference. Her tone was direct and stern as she channeled Abramson, accusing prosecutors and police of violating her clients\u2019 rights of doctor-patient privilege by seizing notes from Erik Menendez\u2019s psychiatrist.\n\n\u201cAny of us that sees a doctor, consults a lawyer or even confides in a priest, minister or rabbi had better be worried,\u201d she said, as Abramson.\n\nAlthough Falco captures the attorney\u2019s tough-as-nails demeanor, she got no advice from her real-life counterpart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did not meet her,\u201d says Falco. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has any interest in being involved with this. That was the word I got. But there\u2019s plenty to see of her on YouTube and in photos. She also wrote a great book called \u2018The Defense Is Ready,\u2019 which said a great deal about who she is and about the justice system, especially at that time.\u201d\n\nLesli Linka Glatter (\u201cHomeland\u201d), who directed the first two episodes and also serves as an executive producer, said she was continually impressed by Falco\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cEdie is an amazing actress, and she cannot lie,\u201d said Glatter. \u201cWhen she takes on a role, she gets fully inside a character.\u201d\n\nTaking on such an intense character in a broadcast network drama was not part of a specific career plan, said Falco.\n\n\u201cI have never known my creative direction after two iconic roles,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a long time after \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 the offers were all Italian wives. After \u2018Nurse Jackie,\u2019 it was tons of scripts about drug addicts.\u201d\n\nReflecting on those roles gives her both personal and professional perspective.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that comes to mind is gratitude,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel tremendously blessed that I was presented with these two things that kept me busy for 10 years each. It kept me working and living in New York, which is what makes me happiest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPortrait of Edie Falco in Pasadena, CA July 24, 2017.
