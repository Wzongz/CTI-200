We're a bit too emotionally unstable right now to deal with confusing jokes of this magnitude okay?\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n'The special effects get better,' he joked to E! at Comic-Con on Saturday. 'I'm about 400 pounds\u2014you just can't tell.'\n\nThe world is already testing our patience enough right now, what with the state of international politics and the bee population being in decline and we're not sure we can deal with any more confusion to be honest Chris.\n\nFortunately, the Australian actor got serious and admitted his superhero body, and those of his Thor: Ragnarok castmates Idris Elba and Mark Ruffalo, actually all came as a result of working hard and cheering each other on in the gym.\n\n'We had a nice gym on set, which we'd all inhabit quite often and get in and motivate each other.\n\n'It's all a very supportive, loving cast on set,' he complimented his co-stars.\n\nOkay, panic over.\n\nRelated Story Charlize Theron On Chris Hemsworth\\'s Bond
