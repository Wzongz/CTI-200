Kelly's \"After Party\" tour is going to be a little shorter -- a bunch of dates have been canceled.\n\nFour of Kelly's 10 upcoming tour dates were canceled Monday. Just last week he'd vowed he would continue touring, despite being accused of running a sex cult with young women.\n\nTwo shows in Louisiana got axed, one in Dallas and another in Los Angeles.\n\nOur sources say the 4 stops were nixed due to poor ticket sales, which shouldn't come as a surprise. As we reported ... his Friday night gig in Virginia was barely half full, and fans were pissed he only played for 45 minutes.\n\nPlay video content JULY 2017 TMZ.com\n\nStill, sources close to Kelly tell TMZ the tour will absolutely go on, explaining the L.A. show was only canceled because of a scheduling conflict with another nearby stop. The sources would not comment about the other 3 terminated shows.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/78/o/2017/07/17/78161d8fa59b5d9b8074810c061a770f_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/29/16by9/2024/02/29/291b4c6bb53d48eea5a5c11ca95fd530_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c7/16by9/2017/07/31/c70a1fb56c0152129904207e83dabb12_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/cc/16by9/2017/07/28/ccafb0a19ae751b6a1cb2ee616929e44_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/4d/16by9/2017/07/29/4d283b71dc0d5ec09c0f3a318a825df2_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b3/16by9/2017/07/29/b38d1e4e027c559aad7fb41f07fcb061_md.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0a/16by9/2024/02/29/0aa34842bc504fffbdb1772dc7b9e84b_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0c/16by9/2024/02/29/0c90d1d1bfdc41f6a4bbf7bac32dc344_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/78/16by9/2024/02/29/781bc6f76b3e42f3bcf1906f6529c43d_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/37/o/2017/07/31/374280fcba5156b2a3cee2d0f4e613b4_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0f/16by9/2024/02/29/0f4e8779abf94f05a4392be2268ffd41_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c7/16by9/2017/07/31/c70a1fb56c0152129904207e83dabb12_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/07/31/r-kelly-tour-dates-being-canceled-poor-ticket-sales/", "title": "R.
