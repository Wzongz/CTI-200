After being majorly on trend for some time, they just stuck around and became a classic staple to own. But every now and then, we want to challenge you to step outside your comfort zone a little bit and try something new. For those looking to do so, or for anyone who avoids skinny jeans in the first place, Bella Hadid's latest look is for you.\n\nThe model was spotted this week in a light-wash Misbhv jacket and similarly washed wide-leg jeans with just a hint of a flare. Opting for a Canadian tuxedo in the first place is stylish in and of itself, but adding in a more fashion-forward denim shape pushes the limits in the best way possible. Plus, Hadid chose to pair her double-denim look with a crop top and Givenchy heeled booties, ensuring her figure didn't get lost in the oversize silhouettes. All in all, she made some very smart choices to help her pull off both trends at once.\n\nScroll on to see and shop the look for yourself!\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nOn Bella Hadid: Misbhv Drained Denim Jacket ($212); Dior bag; Givenchy Pointed Toe Ankle Boots ($1325).\n\nSimilar Style: Are You Am I Ponette Knit Camisole ($139); M.i.h Jeans Topanga Wide-Leg Jeans ($295).\n\nMisbhv Drained Denim Jacket $212 SHOP NOW\n\nAre You Am I Ponette Knit Camisole $139 SHOP NOW\n\nM.i.h Jeans Topanga Wide-Leg Jeans $295 SHOP NOW\n\nGivenchy Pointed Toe Ankle Boots $1325 SHOP NOW\n\nWill you be trying out a similar look?
