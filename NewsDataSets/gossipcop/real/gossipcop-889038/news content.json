From the moment she walked on set with her talent, intellect, and spirit, she became part of the family!\u201d\n\nThe Tony-award winning actress is best known for starring as Dr. Callie Torres on Grey\u2019s Anatomy for more than a decade, exiting in 2016 at the end of season 12 amid contract negotiations for the main cast members. Hope for the actress to return to the long-running medical drama seemed to diminish after Ramirez called out ABC over an offensive joke about bisexual people during an episode of The Real O\u2019Neals; in addition to playing a bisexual character on Grey\u2019s, Ramirez also identifies as bisexual.\n\nRamirez also lends her voice to the animated series Sofia the First.\n\nMadam Secretary airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on CBS.", "images":
