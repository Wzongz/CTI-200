After all, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time The Weeknd has written a song about her.\n\nLoading the player...\n\nAfter the track dropped on Friday, Twitter weighed in.\n\nThe Weeknd ended Selena Gomez when he called her out for victimizing herself because of all the drama she starts. We stan! pic.twitter.com/6wMFKamAZA \u2014 A. (@ScandalousMedia) August 11, 2018\n\nok i loved the weeknd but his songs lately are trash and just dissing Selena \u2026 can't he leave her alone and stop being immature ? \u2014 Taki Taki/Solo FAN (@BpxSGx) August 10, 2018\n\nhttps://twitter.com/agdevonne/status/1028212946638450690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1028212946638450690&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elle.com%2Fculture%2Fa22704996%2Fthe-weeknd-calling-out-selena-gomez-new-song%2F\n\nIn the song, The Weeknd sings about a confusing relationship, where his lover isn\u2019t the person he thought she was. Here, a closer look at the lyrics (via Genius), which were penned by The Weeknd, Minaj, Brittany Hazzard and Jeremy Reid.\n\nMisconstrued your love (misconstrued your love) You confused my love You givin up (up) On love (on love) Not to lose my love (not to lose my love), yea\n\nThe Weeknd sings about being confused and deceived by his lover, which echoes his pained lyrics in \u201cCall Out My Name,\u201d another song he wrote about Selena.\n\nTell me why you let me come inside for real Nevermind, you were never mine for real Hit my line, I\u2019ma hit decline for real I ain\u2019t trying for a second time for real\n\nShortly after Abel and Selena broke up, she got back together with her longtime on-again off-again ex, Justin Bieber. After realizing he was just a rebound, The Weeknd makes it clear there\u2019s no hope for reconciliation.\n\nHonestly, I think this shit excites you (excites you) All that drama that you\u2019re tied to (oh yeah) You play the victim every time too That shit came back and hit you times two\n\nGomez is no stranger to drama, given her status as most followed celebrity on Instagram and high-profile relationships. After reuniting with Bieber, their relationship came to an end after a break turned into a full-fledged breakup. Bieber is now engaged to his girlfriend Hailey Baldwin.\n\nI-I-I-I thought I knew you (thought I knew ya baby) Ha-ha-ha I guess I didn\u2019t (guess I didn\u2019t girl) I-I-I-I thought I knew you (oh yeah) F*ck baby I guess I didn\u2019t I-I-I thought you was down for real (down for real) Thought you would stick around for real (\u2019round for real) I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I\n\nDespite all the crooning, The Weeknd seems to be doing just fine nowadays, after he officially reunited with ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid. The two are reportedly better than ever, with Hadid accompanying him to Lollapalooza last week and most recently, Kylie Jenner\u2019s 21st birthday party.\n\nVia: ELLE US", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/08/selena-g-and-the-weekend.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/rising-sign-astrology-kendall-jenner.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/Group.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/06/BellaWeeknd.jpg?resize=380%2C304&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/Untitled-1920-x-1080-px-28.png?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/08/1534130874258_theweekendfbsell.jpg?resize=600%2C315&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/elle-launch-event.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/02/Elle-Cover.jpg?resize=731%2C1024&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/BELLA-ABEL.jpg?resize=380%2C304&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/08/1534130874258_theweekendfbsell.jpg?resize=600%2C315&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Yaptangco"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/a22704996/the-weeknd-calling-out-selena-gomez-new-song/", "title": "Fans Think The Weekend's New Song 'I Thought I Knew You' Talks About Selena Gomez", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "While The Weekend and Bella Hadid have finally make it official, The Weekend's new song in collaboration with Nicki Minaj 'I Thought I Knew You' takes digs at his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fans Think The Weekend's New Song 'I Thought I Knew You' Is About Selena Gomez", "description": "Some serious shade.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/a22704996/the-weeknd-calling-out-selena-gomez-new-song/", "site_name": "ELLE", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/08/1534130874258_theweekendfbsell.jpg?resize=600%2C315&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-13T00:36:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-12-02T14:11:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "2 minutes", "label2": "Written by", "data2": "Ariana Yaptangco"}, "sailthru.date": "2018-08-13 00:36:38", "sailthru.title": "Fans Think The Weekend Is Calling Out Selena Gomez In New Song \u2018Thought I Knew You\u2019", "sailthru.author": "Ariana Yaptangco", "sailthru.description": "<p>Some serious shade.</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/08/selena-g-and-the-weekend.jpg?fit=742%2C618&ssl=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/08/selena-g-and-the-weekend.jpg?fit=50%2C42&ssl=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/cropped-ElleFavIcon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534120598.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com.au", "summary": ""}
