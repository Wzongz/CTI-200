Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThe upcoming Ocean\u2019s 8 will reportedly have a number of big-name cameos from celebrities such as Anna Wintour, Kim Kardashian, and this cool dog riding a skateboard. But for some, the opportunity to appear in the all-female reboot of the Ocean\u2019s Trilogy came with a cost. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly Radio, JoJo Fletcher\u2019s once-almost-sister-in-law Olivia Munn said that she had to pay for her own makeup and wardrobe in the film\u2019s Met Gala scene:\n\nThey\u2019re like, \u201cDo your own glam,\u201d and I got the dress and all that and then you submit the bills for it because I\u2019m part of your movie. And then [the producers are] like, \u201cOh no, the bills come right back to you.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Munn said she is \u201cjust as excited \u2026 as everybody else\u201d for the film\u2019s release in June 2018.\n\nWhile it is unclear just how much Munn paid for her appearance, no price seems too high for the chance to appear onscreen alongside legends such as Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, and Skateboard Dog.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6c8/ee5/bdfaa60b520dddb89ce3b17a3200d6f519-Olivia-Munn.rsquare.w400.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/92f/315/70cc22339e9d6bc9eaba20e74a417db10b-MadeleineAggler.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/105/357/c24fc71f3267590e05bed9a0ba2160bebd-vulture-internet-column-0301.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.gif", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6c8/ee5/bdfaa60b520dddb89ce3b17a3200d6f519-Olivia-Munn.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/74c/3f3/ee9ac056b3f48f07f3af77021794ece26d-0524-Cov-4x5-B.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/23f/1a1/a2da00f74535fff40c3a8d1da174a9bf7e-GettyImages-200-moshed-02-28-16-08-01.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b81/382/b157e7dc60244ceb34502e5c889cc5afa5-000128200028-HRT-R3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6c8/ee5/bdfaa60b520dddb89ce3b17a3200d6f519-Olivia-Munn.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madeleine Aggeler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/olivia-munn-had-to-pay-for-her-cameo-in-oceans-8.html", "title": "Olivia Munn Had to Pay for Her Cameo in Ocean\u2019s 8", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "culture, celebrity, olivia munn, ocean's eight, cameo, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Olivia Munn Had to Pay for Her Cameo in Ocean\u2019s 8", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/olivia-munn-had-to-pay-for-her-cameo-in-oceans-8.html", "description": "How much would you spend to be in a movie with Rihanna?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6c8/ee5/bdfaa60b520dddb89ce3b17a3200d6f519-Olivia-Munn.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Olivia Munn Had to Pay for Her Cameo in Ocean\u2019s 8", "description": "How much would you spend to be in a movie with Rihanna?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6c8/ee5/bdfaa60b520dddb89ce3b17a3200d6f519-Olivia-Munn.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mmaggeler", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-20T00:19:39.702-04:00", "tag": "culture, celebrity, olivia munn, ocean's eight, cameo", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "The actress said she had to pay for her own hair and makeup for her appearance in the film\u2019s Met Gala scene.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "culture, celebrity, olivia munn, ocean's eight, cameo", "author": "Madeleine Aggeler", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "sectionOverride": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.thecut.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505881179.702, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
