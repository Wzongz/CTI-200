{"url": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/30/shadowhunters-star-dominic-sherwood-apologizes-using-gay-slur/", "text": "Let\u2019s admit it: by the time Hollywood\u2019s awards season draws to a close, most of us are more than ready for a good mindless \u201cB movie\u201d to cleanse our palettes. After the glut of \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d films dominating the public conversation, it\u2019s just incredibly freeing to watch something that feels \u2014 at some level, at least \u2014 more like entertainment than it does like doing homework.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the biggest reasons why the timing of \u201cDrive-Away Dolls,\u201d which hit screens on Feb. 23, feels like a really savvy move, especially since it comes from a major Hollywood studio and boasts a multi-Oscar-winning director \u2013 Ethan Coen, who alongside brother Joel is half of one of Hollywood\u2019s most prodigious filmmaking teams \u2013 at its helm. A retro-inspired and neon-lit road trip/chick flick/neo-noir thriller featuring lesbian leading characters and leaning hard into the visual palette of the \u201870s-era exploitation drive-in movie fodder it aims to both emulate and reinvent, it lays no claim to lofty purpose or intellectual conceit; instead, it takes its audience on an unabashedly raunchy 1999-set wild ride in which a pair of mismatched adventurers find themselves unwittingly entangled in a caper involving a mysterious briefcase and the eccentric trio of thugs tasked with tracking it down. It tells the kind of story we expect to be able to check our brains at the door for, and just sit back to enjoy the mindless thrills.\n\nIn this case, that story centers on two young queer Philadelphia women \u2013 free-spirited sexual adventurer Jamie (Margaret Qualley), whose infidelity has tanked her relationship with girlfriend Suki (Beanie Feldstein), and square peg Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan), whose discomfort with the hedonistic social scene of big city lesbian life has her longing for the simpler pleasures of her childhood home in Tallahassee \u2013 who embark on a road trip together to Florida in search of new beginnings. It\u2019s clear from the start that they\u2019re at cross purposes; Jamie sees the trip as an opportunity to \u201cloosen up\u201d her uptight friend, while Marian just wants to get back to where she once belonged. Unbeknownst to either, however, a shady cadre of operatives (Colman Domingo, Joey Slotnick, C.J. Wilson) is on their trail, thanks to something hidden in the trunk of their rental car, and their journey is about to take a detour into unexpectedly dangerous territory.\n\nAs a premise, it\u2019s not hard to see close parallels to many of the themes one often finds running throughout the Coen Brothers\u2019 films; the quirky trappings of its crime story plot, the granular focus on the behavioral oddities of its characters, the whimsical (if often pointed) irony it deploys for narrative effect \u2013 all these and more give Ethan\u2019s first \u201csolo flight\u201d without collaboration from his brother the kind of familiarity for audiences one can only get from four decades of previous exposure. Yet while \u201cDrive-Away Dolls\u201d might bear a lot of the trademark Coen touches, it\u2019s also distinctively its own creature, with a more radical stylistic approach that one might glimpse in more flamboyant outliers to their joint filmography like \u201cThe Hudsucker Proxy\u201d or cult-favorite \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d but which here brings its heightened sense of absurdity to the forefront in service of a story which is about, as much as it is anything, the role of causality in determining the circumstances and outcomes of our lives. In other words, it\u2019s a movie which drives home (no pun intended) the point that \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 our paths are determined by fate, no matter how much control we think we exert.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking that all this analysis doesn\u2019t quite fit for a movie that presents itself as a madcap escapist romp, you\u2019re not wrong; in spite of its ostensible B movie appeal, Coen\u2019s movie \u2013 co-written with his wife, Tricia Cook \u2013 evokes some pretty weighty reflections, and while that might lend a more elevated layer to the film\u2019s proceedings than we expect, it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. We can be entertained and enlightened at the same time, after all.\n\nPerhaps more detrimental to the movie\u2019s effect, unfortunately, is its intricately-conceived plotting. Weaving together seemingly coincidental or irrelevant details into a chain of events that propels the story at every juncture, Coen and Cooke\u2019s screenplay feels more devoted to cleverness than authenticity; outlandish plot twists pile up, under the guise of some esoteric cosmic significance, until they threaten to collapse in on themselves; in the end, for many viewers, it might all seem just a little too forced to be believable.\n\nFortunately, there are things to counterbalance that sense of overthinking that seems to permeate the script, most vital of which is the movie\u2019s unambivalent embrace of its queer narrative. While it may borrow the familiar lesbians-on-the-run road tropes queer audiences have known for decades, it presents them in a story refreshingly devoid of shame or stigma; the sexuality of its heroines is something to be explored with nuance rather than subjected to the fetishized bias of the so-called \u201cmale gaze,\u201d and it succeeds in giving us \u201ctastefully\u201d explicit scenes of same sex love that celebrate the joy of human connection rather than turning it into a voyeuristic spectacle. Even more important, perhaps, \u201cDrive-Away Dolls\u201d omits one particularly toxic clich\u00e9 of queer stories on film by refuising to make its queer heroines into victims; they\u2019re way too smart for that, and it makes us like them all the more, even if we don\u2019t quite find ourselves absorbed in their story.\n\nFor this, full credit must go to Qualley and Viswanathan, who individually build fully relatable and multi-dimensional characters while also finding a sweet and believable chemistry within the awkwardness of finding a romantic love story between two friends \u2013 a complex species of relationship that surely deserves a more extensive and nuanced treatment than it gets space for in Coen\u2019s film. As good as they are, though, it\u2019s Feldstein\u2019s relatively small supporting turn that steals the movie, with an unflinching-yet-hilarious tough-as-nails performance as Qualley\u2019s ex that both acknowledges and undercuts the stereotype of the \u201cangry lesbian\u201d while striking an immensely satisfying blow for queer female empowerment. The always-stellar Domingo underplays his way through an effectively civilized supporting performance as the chief \u201cheavy\u201d, and Matt Damon makes a sly cameo as a conservative politician, while daddy-of-the-decade Pedro Pascal shows up for a brief but key role that gives winking service to fans who remember him from his \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d days \u2013 though to say more about any of those appearances would constitute a spoiler.\n\n\u201cDrive-Away Dolls\u201d has been met with mixed reviews, and this one is no exception. There\u2019s an unmistakable good intention behind it, and much to be appreciated in its sex-positive outlook and commitment to an unapologetically queer story and characters, but while its stylistic embellishments provide for campy enjoyment, it\u2019s ultimately diffused by its own cleverness. Still, the queer joy that frequently peeks through it is more than enough reason to say that it\u2019s a good choice for a fun date night at the movies.\n\nAt the end of the day, what more can you ask?", "images": ["https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2024/02/Mark_Pocan_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key_and_Lori-Chavez-DeRemer_public_domain_split_insert-400x240.jpg",
