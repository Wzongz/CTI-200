And over here at The Daily Dish, that means looking back on all of the Real Housewives we've had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know this year.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills on Bravo on Wednesdays at 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo App.\n\nSince March 21, 2006 when The Real Housewives of Orange County originally premiered, more than 100 women have been given the prestigious title of Real Housewife. In 2018 alone, we met nine new Housewives, with five out of the seven franchises welcoming new additions this year.\n\nLook back on all of the lovely ladies we met this year, and we guarantee you'll fall in love with them all over again.\n\nTeddi Mellencamp Arroyave\n\nWhat Does John Mellencamp Think of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills?\n\nSo technically we met Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave at the end of 2017 upon the Season 8 premiere of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and we're admitting that because we know the accountability coach would call us out on it if we didn't. But we just couldn't resist including the mom of two.\n\nCandiace Dillard\n\nCheck In With Candiace Dillard Moments Before She Walks Down the Aisle\n\nThis year brought a whole lot of new to Candiace Dillard's life. Not only did she become the newest member of The Real Housewives of Potomac in Season 3, but she also wed fianc\u00e9 Chris Bassett in a grand ceremony in Washington, D.C. on August 11. We can't wait to see what 2019 brings for Candiace!\n\nDenise Richards\n\nDenise Richards Is Married!\n\nSeason 9 of RHOBH may still be on its way, but it was confirmed back in August that Denise Richards would be joining the 90210 squad in the new season. \u201cI am so excited to join the cast of [RHOBH] as I am a huge fan of the show,\" Denise told PEOPLE at the time of her announcement. \u201cI am looking forward to spending time with all the ladies\u2026 and hopefully meeting Boy George!!\u201d\n\nWe're looking forward to spending time with you too, Denise!\n\nEmily Simpson\n\nTamra Judge and Emily Simpson Haven't Always Been Friends\n\nEmily Simpson certainly made a splash in her inaugural season of RHOC in Season 13, finding herself at odds with the likes of Shannon Beador and Kelly Dodd. However, Emily's husband, Shane Simpson, also memorably found himself in some major Real Housewives drama at Eddie Judge's birthday party. He's also been a bit of a buzzy figure among RHOC fans. But overall, Emily's RHOC debut has been an inspiring one as she opened up about painful parts of her past and promoted body positivity.\n\nGina Kirschenheiter\n\nDid Emily Simpson and Gina Kirschenheiter Watch RHOC Before Coming On?\n\nSome women come into The Real Housewives a little more on the timid side in their first season. Gina Kirschenheiter is not one of those women. The Long Island native wasn't afraid to speak her mind when she joined RHOC in Season 13, whether it was standing up to Vicki Gunvalson or getting involved in Shannon and Tamra Judge's friendship drama. Gina was open with her personal life this season of RHOC, sharing her decision to divorce her husband, Matt Kirschenheiter, and what the future holds for her family.\n\nRelated\n\nEva Marcille\n\nDid Eva Marcille Just Throw Some Shade at Cynthia Bailey's Modeling Skills?\n\nEva Marcille is no stranger to TV. She first burst onto the scene as the winner of Cycle 3 of America's Next Top Model in 2004. And we actually first got to know her in Season 10 of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. However, Eva became a full-fledged Housewife this season of RHOA, and she just continues to bring the fierceness.\n\nShamari DeVoe\n\nShamari DeVoe Reveals She's Been in an Open Relationship\n\nShamari DeVoe is no stranger to the spotlight. The RHOA newcomer, who joined the crew in Season 11, was one-third of the R&B-pop trio Blaque. She's also the wife of music legend Ronnie DeVoe. But as we all know, nothing can prepare you for hanging out with the RHOA squad. Shamari seems to be holding her own so far in Season 11, and we're expecting big things from this newbie.\n\nJackie Goldschneider\n\n5 Things You Need to Know About Jackie Goldschneider\n\nThings are heating up in Season 9 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, and that's partly due to Jackie Goldschneider, who has found herself in a bit of a beef with Garden State OG Teresa Giudice. From what we've seen so far, we honestly wouldn't want to cross either of these strong women.\n\nJennifer Aydin\n\n5 Things You Need to Know About Jennifer Aydin\n\nOne of the best parts of meeting a new Housewife is getting a magnificent new mansion to ogle, and Jennifer Aydin's Paramus palace did not disappoint. We've already seen that Jennifer can bring the fun and handle the drama, too. It's a win-win-win!", "images":
