The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment, politics and the media \u2014 including her former NBC \u201cToday Show\u201d co-host, Matt Lauer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very fortunate in terms of not being subjected to a lot of sexual misconduct, but certainly I have been subjected to widely held attitudes about women, about compartmentalizing women,\u201d Couric said when asked about career obstacles by Carolyn Tastad, president of P&G\u2019s North America business group, in the forum\u2019s keynote discussion.\n\nCouric cited the frequent descriptions of her as \u201ccute\u201d and \u201cperky,\u201d which she found \u201cmarginalizing.\u201d She joked that on her tombstone, it will say \u201cPerky No More.\u201d\n\nShe also recalled public critiques of her clothing when she began hosting \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d and a jarring moment early in her career when she walked into a meeting at CNN and an executive said of her to others around the table: \u201cShe\u2019s successful because of her hard work, intelligence and breast size.\u201d\n\nCouric said with support from her supervisor, a male anchor, she wrote to the executive and he soon called her, \u201cdripping with apologies.\u201d\n\nCouric described the #MeToo movement as like \u201ca long-dormant volcano that\u2019s erupting\u201d and said it\u2019s important for men to be part of open discussions on gender issues, on how to make things better. But she said she thinks it \u201cjust feels almost too red-hot\u201d for some to have such discussions publicly yet.\n\nCouric has said she had been unaware of the misconduct allegations that led to Lauer\u2019s ouster last year.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell", "images":
