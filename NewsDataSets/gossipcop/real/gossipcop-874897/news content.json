That\u2019s why he flip-flops on issues, sends a constant stream of ill-conceived tweets, can\u2019t keep his hands off women, and never misses an opportunity to shoot himself in the foot. Recently, former George W. Bush adviser Steve Schmidt called Trump out for his childish behavior. \u201cClearly, we have a 71-year-old president of the United States who has the impulse control of a little child, who feels aggrieved, who\u2019s resentful, who\u2019s a constant victim,\u201d he told MSNBC.\n\nAs someone who has lived on the surface of the Earth for over 70 years, Trump should know that one of the worst things you can do is stare directly at the sun. One prolonged gaze into our solar system\u2019s center of energy can cause permanent eye damage. \u201cThe light from the sun is very intense and concentrated into a very small area, and then that light is converted into heat and that heat cooks the retina,\u201d said Joel Schuman, chair of ophthalmology at New York University\u2019s Langone Health. \u201cSo you have a permanent area that you don\u2019t see, a permanent blind spot.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, when Trump stood in front of reporters on the Truman Balcony at the White House with his wife, Melania, and his son, Barron, he had one job: resist the temptation to stare directly at the sun. Even after a White House aid yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t look at it!\u201d our ever-defiant leader with self-described \u201cvery good brain\u201d craned his neck, squinted his eyes, and stared directly into the sun.\n\nLater Monday night, he\u2019ll address the country on the ongoing war in Afghanistan.\n\nSomeone shouts \"don't look\" as Pres.
