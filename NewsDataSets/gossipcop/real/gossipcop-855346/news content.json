office worker from Leeds getting ready for a night out, no one likes to turn up to a party on their own and endure the awkward moment of pretending to message friends on their phone while waiting for their 'crew' to arrive.\n\nSo, that might explain why Prince Harry drove a whopping 100 miles to pick up his girlfriend, Suits actress Meghan Markle, for Pippa Middleton's wedding reception on Saturday evening.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFollowing 33-year-old Pippa's traditional wedding, which saw her wearing a lace, cap-sleeved Giles Deacon dress and Prince George and Princess Charlotte serve as pageboy and flower girl, respectively, Prince Harry reportedly made a 100-mile trip from St Mark's church in the Berkshire village of Englefield, all the way back to to his home at Kensington Palace, London.\n\nThe royal was then spotted driving his 35-year-old girlfriend in a grey Audi to the Middletons' Berkshire estate to join Pippa and James Matthews' 200 guests.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarkle's appearance at the wedding reception comes after much disappointment for royal fans who expected to see the California-born beauty at the exchange of vows with her boyfriend Haryy and her potential future in-laws, including the likes of Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHowever, it is reported Prince Harry decided not to bring his girlfriend to the church as it's against royal protocol for members of the royal family to upstage proceedings and, of course, all eyes would have been on Meghan if she was to have attended.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFollowing the wedding, the bride and groom were spotted driving away in an E-type Jaguar convertible as they waved and thanked well-wishers outside the church.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMiddleton's nuptials, at which there was a glass palace erected in her parents' garden, also reportedly saw guests using unique passwords and photo identification to enter the reception, in order to protect the couple's privacy, according to The Cut.\n\nAnyone else wish they'd nabbed an invite?\n\nRelated Story Pippa Middleton\\'s Dream Wedding In Pictures", "images":
