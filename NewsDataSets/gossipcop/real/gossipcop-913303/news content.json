Here\u2019s the thing \u2013 we were against each other if I\u2019m being completely honest,\u201d\n\nDavid and Victoria tried to show a united front in the face of fresh cheating rumours although Victoria reveals during this picture the couple were against each other. (Credit: Getty)\n\n\u201cBut when we were in Spain, it didn\u2019t really feel like we had each other either\u2026 And that\u2019s sad. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how hard it was and how it affected me. It was a nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe couple had put up a united front until September, 2003 when he was spotted at a nightclub in Madrid with Rebecca. Then the rumours start.\n\nDavid explained that he felt physically ill when asked if it affected his performance on the field, admitting that there, \u201cwere some days I thought, \u2018How am I going to go to work? How am I going to go on that training pitch and look as if nothing is wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cVictoria is everything to me, to see her hurt was incredibly difficult, but we\u2019re fighters and at that time we needed to fight for each other, we needed to fight for our family.\u201d\n\nVictoria admitted, \u201cIt was the most unhappy I have ever been in my entire life.\u201d\n\nDavid Beckham got his start at Manchester United, famous for his goal from the halfway line in his own half. It had never been done. (Credit: Getty)\n\nDavid\u2019s alleged affair with assistant Rebecca Loos\n\nIn 2003, David was in the prime of his football career. The England Captain had been sold by his home club Manchester United to Spain\u2019s Real Madrid, for a whopping price. And while his star had never been brighter, a shock was soon to hit the Beckham family.\n\nIn September of that year, David was spotted with a woman at a nightclub in Madrid. The woman was later identified as his assistant Rebecca Loos.\n\nSubsequently, the rumour mill kick-started into overdrive, churning out tales that the Beckham marriage was in trouble, which David denied.\n\nThe now-defunct News Of The World, published a story from \u201ca source\u201d outlining several sexual encounters David and Loos allegedly had after that night at the club.\n\nThey also reported the two exchanged racy texts. The story claimed Victoria contacted the assistant, warning her to stay away.\n\nRebecca Loos reportedly had an affair with David Beckham while the pair were working together in Spain. (Credit: Getty)\n\nRebecca Loos\u2019 brother\u2019s statement\n\nLoos brother then surprised British tabloids by claiming his sister had confirmed to him that she\u2019d had an affair with David in Spain.\n\n\u201cRebecca phoned home early this morning. I am overwhelmed with shock,\u201d Loos\u2019 brother John Charles told the Daily Mail in April 2004.\n\n\u201cRebecca was upset when she parted company with David and Victoria last year. She became very down and cried a lot. At times she looked heartbroken. I thought it was because of professional reasons. But now I am beginning to understand there must have been more to it.\u201d\n\nRebecca Loos, Victoria Beckham and her son Romeo watch David play for Real Madrid back in 2003. (Credit: Getty)\n\nWhile explosive allegations of David\u2019s infidelity flew, Victoria reportedly packed up their two children and flew to Switzerland, where David was to meet them from Madrid. Spokespeople for the family said the trip was a long-planned getaway and not a plan to escape media attention.\n\nDavid\u2019s statement on alleged affair\n\nIn response to Loos\u2019 brother\u2019s comments, David released a statement.\n\n\u201cDuring the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life,\u201d it read.\n\n\u201cWhat appeared this morning is just one further example. The simple truth is that I am very happily married. I have a wonderful wife and two very special kids. There is nothing any third party can do to change these facts.\u201d\n\nDuring the time of the cheating rumours, the couple had two children, Brooklyn and Romeo. (Credit: Getty)\n\nRebecca Loos\u2019 tell-all\n\nRebecca gave an explosive tell-all interview with SKY TV alleging her professional relationship turned romantic with David as he grew lonely in Madrid.\n\n\u201cI think the chemistry between David and I was so strong and people were not happy because I was being very unprofessional and he\u2019s a married man,\u201d she said at the time.\n\n\u201cHe is very generous lover. He gives a lot. He pleases. He knows what you want. It\u2019s all about you and not so much about him. It\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the Beckham\u2019s intention to involved layers, Loos replied, \u201cWhat are they consulting their lawyers for? What can they do? I think they have worked very hard at getting the image they have and I think they will do everything they can to maintain it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo whether that involves having happy shots taken or calling their lawyers it\u2019s up to them. I am 100 percent sure of what I am talking about, there no doubt in my mind I have no reason to lie \u2014 why should I? I am just here to tell you my experience. He knows the truth and I know the truth.\u201d\n\nAgain, Victoria and David vehemently denied Loos\u2019 story calling it \u201cabsurd and unsubstantiated\u201d.\n\nVictoria and her two sons, Brooklyn and Romeo relocated to Spain so the family could be together with David.\n\nThe couple have weathered allegations of affairs time and time again. (Credit: Getty)\n\nThe Beckham\u2019s sue\n\nFollowing the months and months of stories of alleged infidelities, the soccer player and his wife turned to their lawyers, seeking justice.\n\nIn 2004, they filed a lawsuit against News of the World, after a story was published claiming David also had an affair with a beautician named Danielle Heath.\n\nThe couple then amended the complaint in 2005 to include another story by the publisher which detailed quotes from the couple\u2019s former-nanny Abbie Gibson, that the Beckham marriage was a lie. They also sued the nanny for breach of confidence.\n\n\u201cWe are sick and tired of people trying to make money at the expense of our family,\u201d the Beckhams said in a statement.\n\nThe ultimate power-couple. (Credit: Getty)\n\nWhere is Rebecca Loos now?\n\nFourteen years after her alleged affair with David Beckham, Rebecca Loos has completely turned her life around.\n\nAfter being dismissed from her position at Real Madrid, Loos went on to star on a range of reality TV shows.\n\nThe Spanish-born beauty eventually fell in love with medical adviser Sven Christjar Skaiaa, who worked on one of the shows she appeared on.\n\nRebecca Loos has kept a low profile after accusing David Beckham of cheating on his wife. (Credit: Instagram)\n\nShe is now married to Sven and shares two sons with him. The family live a low-key life in Norway which Loos frequently writes about on her blog.\n\nDavid and Victoria renewed their vows between 2003-2007 while they were living in Spain and went on a whirlwind 24-hour honeymoon. The couple now have four gorgeous children and are stronger than ever.", "images":
