You\u2019re more precious than ever. So thankful to have you in my life. \u2764\ufe0f\"\n\nMiley's father Billy Ray Cyrus also used the platform to share his sentiment for the occasion, posting a photo of Miley with her grandmother, mother Tish, sister Noah, fianc\u00e9 Liam Hemsworth, and other family members surrounding a cake with the number \"26\" on top.\n\n\"Thankful for this moment. My thoughts and prayers with so many hearts that need mended. Peace and love to all,\" Billy Ray captioned the photo. His message comes just a few weeks after it was revealed that Miley and Liam lost their home to the fires that ripped through Malibu earlier this month.\n\nIn a deeply sentimental Instagram post, Liam captured what remained of their home as of November 13 after it had been engulfed by the fires: Love.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a heartbreaking few days. This is what\u2019s left of my house. Love. Many people in Malibu and surrounding areas in California have lost their homes also and my heart goes out to everyone who was affected by these fires,\" Hemsworth captioned the photo. \"I spent the day in Malibu yesterday and it was amazing to see the community pulling together to help each other out in any way they can. Malibu is a strong community and this event is only going to make it stronger. Thankful for all the great local guys that helped keep smaller fires out around my property. I love u guys. I love you Malibu.\"", "images":
