Finding time for herself amidst a booming career and life as a new parent hasn't been easy, so Dewan Tatum has gotten creative. She and her 4-year-old daughter Everly are known to get up and dance any time a song comes on in a movie they're watching. \"We all have moments where we feel insecure, [but] I think moving your body is essential to a healthy mind,\" she says.\n\nJuggling work, parenthood, and a sex life can get challenging, but Dewan Tatum says she and Channing do their best to make time for each other.\n\nI ask her if she has any creative solutions to maintaining an exciting sex life as a new parent. She laughs and says, \"No, we just do whatever we can to see each other and make it work.\" Dewan Tatum adds that like anything in life\u2014careers, relationships, whatever\u2014there are ebbs and flows. And instead of being hard on herself, she does her best and takes it in stride. \"You just try to make it a priority,\" she says. \"At certain times, you're better at it than other times.\"\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnd as far as she's concerned, awkward moments in the bedroom (yes, she's experienced them, too) are honestly no big deal. \"I think everyone's had an awkward, embarrassing moment in the bedroom,\" Dewan Tatum says. \"If you haven't, you're not living\u2014it's just a part of life.\" She laughs before zeroing in on her point: \"I think every experience you have\u2014sexually or not sexually\u2014brings you closer to what you want to feel in life.\" For her, an uncomfortable moment in bed is an excuse to reevaluate what she's actually into and then go for it. \"Really, every great experience comes from your own sense of self and your own confidence,\" she continues.\n\nDewan Tatum describes parenting the same way she describes many fulfilling things in life: scary, yet rewarding.\n\nI mention something Dewan Tatum Instagrammed recently\u2014a quote card that said, \"Choose to expand.\" In the post's caption, she wrote, \"Always choosing the more expansive feeling in your life makes room for the magic,\" which she reiterates to me now. Whether she's pursuing a new career opportunity, considering jumping off a cliff (literally), or tackling first-time parenting, she tries to do the expansive, risky, and ultimately fulfilling thing. \"It's hard because you want to choose the thing that makes you feel more comfortable or sheltered or safe,\" she says. \"But there's always the thing right beyond that\u2014the one that's maybe a little scary and intimidating. If you choose that, your whole life and sense of power gets bigger.\"", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/65ce5330a406e53aaa9d8e1c/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65cbd5b406663dec9d4596f1/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a68d4660d57890ac882b791/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65c65f19e298986c63b24e6d/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/65c3ef25227ec31500e9bd85/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/65bd0595e896a7d09ade38d3/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65dcdbc0c036bea26a468646/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/65ce915dc657b23bf3c90de9/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65c15cc4105c74e94acb75a0/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/65e0de3d56fd88b51689139d/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65bd0c89d4755ef841d32295/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65de1af1fa0c031609901190/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lindsey Lanquist"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/jenna-dewan-tatum-interview", "title": "Jenna Dewan Tatum: If You Haven\u2019t Had an Awkward Moment in Bed, You\u2019re Not Living", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2024", "description": "Actress and dancer Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about first-time parenting, practicing self-care through fitness, and embracing awkward sex moments.", "id": "59b2dfb895f25105a11194a4", "keywords": "jenna dewan tatum,news,channing tatum,sex", "news_keywords": "jenna dewan tatum,news,channing tatum,sex", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59b2dfb895f25105a11194a4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Actress and dancer Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about first-time parenting, practicing self-care through fitness, and embracing awkward sex moments.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about embarrassing sex moments, practicing self-care through fitness, and more.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Jenna Dewan Tatum Shares How She Keeps Her Sex Life Exciting as a New Parent", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/jenna-dewan-tatum-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-12T21:13:18.464Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-12T21:13:18.464Z", "author": "Lindsey Lanquist"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about embarrassing sex moments, practicing self-care through fitness, and more.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "Jenna Dewan Tatum Shares How She Keeps Her Sex Life Exciting as a New Parent"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505250798.464, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
