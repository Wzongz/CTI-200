He had posted a pic of Bella's apartment recently, and she fears he might be staking out her New York City apartment.\n\nCops say Perez had been on a harassment campaign against Bella. According to legal docs, Hadid had received multiple Instagram messages from an account registered to Perez. She also received an Instagram video of Perez near her Tribeca apartment building.\n\nOne Instagram message reads, \"You want me to come? I'm going to come there now.\" He goes on, \"Please don't make me come all the way down there.\"", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b1/16by9/2024/02/27/b16a2ddef94e41669a661fc8918d2d1b_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/00/16by9/2024/02/28/00b11a97acbd4a388f2d16f7ca502daf_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e8/16by9/2024/02/27/e8790d5af1294d89b0a68f291d479ce2_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/79/16by9/2024/02/27/7966c0dea6534955b22dafabfdb87ed6_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/90/16by9/2018/02/04/90fab537526b5880906928d28cae8cf9_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d0/o/2018/02/13/d0aa706ba32e531eba83956a7c165f7b_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/28/16by9/2018/01/25/28c1dc93972e597b873fa8eccf56f1cf_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/92/16by9/2024/02/27/92d19d8fa0434333a379658b76efdd57_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d8/16by9/2018/02/13/d84966465ba5523fb8998a98a4efeb2e_xl.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d8/16by9/2018/02/13/d84966465ba5523fb8998a98a4efeb2e_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/02/13/bella-hadid-restraining-order-stalker-apartment-building/", "title": "Bella Hadid Gets Restraining Order Against Stalker", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large", "description": "Bella Hadid gets restraining order against scary alleged stalker", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/02/13/bella-hadid-restraining-order-stalker-apartment-building/", "title": "Bella Hadid Gets Restraining Order Against Stalker", "description": "Bella Hadid gets restraining order against scary alleged stalker", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d8/16by9/2018/02/13/d84966465ba5523fb8998a98a4efeb2e_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bella Hadid Gets Restraining Order Against Stalker", "description": "Bella Hadid gets restraining order against scary alleged stalker", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d8/16by9/2018/02/13/d84966465ba5523fb8998a98a4efeb2e_xl.jpg"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.rhythmnewmedia.tmz&referrer=utm_source%3Dsmartbanner%26utm_medium%3Dnative%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartbanner%26anid%3Dadmob", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, affiliate-data=ct=Smart_Banner&pt=201436, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2018/02/13/bella-hadid-restraining-order-stalker-apartment-building/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518451200.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
