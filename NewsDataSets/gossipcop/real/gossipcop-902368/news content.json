As we round out the year, let's take a walk down memory lane, shall we? This year saw an incoming of so many new trends, and naturally, that meant others were pushed to the sidelines, if not trampled completely. More so than anyone else, celebs were the early adopters of 2018's most cutting-edge trends, from bucket hats to baguette bags, which means they were also the first people to make like Ariana Grande and say thank you, next to their outdated pieces.\n\nIn the interest of taking stock of what's en vogue on the celebrity front, we investigated which outdated celebrity fashion trends never made it past December 31, 2017, and found seven major trends that altogether vanished from celebrities' closets from then till now. Have you also noticed that items like bomber jackets and off-the-shoulder tops are nowhere to be found? Keep reading to see which pieces are out of sight, out of mind and which fresher styles have replaced them.\n\nLeft in 2017: Sock Boots (Image credit: Gotham/GC Images)\n\nSwapped In: Square-Toe Boots (Image credit: BG021/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)\n\nKendall Jenner wore a lot of ankle boots this year, but among her top styles on rotation, sleek square-toe boots were a clear favorite while the sock boots she wore all throughout 2017 were nowhere to be found.\n\nIntentionally Blank More Hugs Square Toe Boots $229 SHOP NOW\n\nLeft in 2017: Bomber Jackets (Image credit: Raymond Hall/GC Images)\n\nSwapped In: Windbreakers (Image credit: Gotham/GC Images)\n\nAshley Graham has long been our legging muse since we can always count on her to bring her athleisure A-game.
