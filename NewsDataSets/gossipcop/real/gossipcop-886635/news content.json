Just give me the f---ing summons\u201d and \u201cwrap this summons around your head.\u201d\n\nActor Alec Baldwin exits the 6th precinct of the New York Police Department in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 2, 2018. Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nA police source added at the time that Baldwin \u201cgot arrogant and loud,\" which is why he was given his second summons for disorderly conduct.\n\nBaldwin responded in a tweet of his own, naming the officer and declaring, \"New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump, whom Baldwin impersonates on \"Saturday Night Live,\" had a few words of encouragement for the actor, when told about the impending charge.\n\n\u201cI wish him luck,\" he said.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/alec-baldwin-arrest-02-rtr-jc-181102_hpMain.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wirestory_905ba3bc63d00c8ff7d6504608bb91f3_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/alec-baldwin-ss-jc-1811025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/alec-baldwin-ss-jc-1811025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/richard-lewis-gty-jef-240228_1709153433230_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump2-gty-ml-240228_1709134106555_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/texas-wildfire-rt-lv-240227_1709079785113_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/election-2-rt-er-240220_1708449640851_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/alec-baldwin-ss-jc-1811025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/Stars/alec-baldwin-denies-punched-parking-spot-assault-arrest/story?id=58950759", "title": "Alec Baldwin denies he 'punched anyone over a parking spot,' following assault arrest in New York", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/Stars/alec-baldwin-denies-punched-parking-spot-assault-arrest/story?id=58950759", "title": "Alec Baldwin denies he 'punched anyone over a parking spot,' following assault arrest in New York", "description": "The actor has faced legal trouble in New York before.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/alec-baldwin-ss-jc-1811025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article"}, "description": "The actor has faced legal trouble in New York before.", "keywords": "Article, 58950759", "copyright": "2024 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Alec Baldwin denies he 'punched anyone over a parking spot,' following assault arrest in New York", "lastPublishedDate": "2018-11-04T03:09:30Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,58950759", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,58950759", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/Stars/alec-baldwin-denies-punched-parking-spot-assault-arrest/story?id=58950759"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Alec Baldwin denies he 'punched anyone over a parking spot,' following assault arrest in New York", "description": "The actor has faced legal trouble in New York before.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/Stars/alec-baldwin-denies-punched-parking-spot-assault-arrest/story?id=58950759", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/alec-baldwin-ss-jc-1811025_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,58950759", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,58950759", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/Stars/alec-baldwin-denies-punched-parking-spot-assault-arrest/story?id=58950759", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/Stars/alec-baldwin-denies-punched-parking-spot-assault-arrest/story?id=58950759"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
