He Has It On Video\n\n1:08 PM PST -- The Kanawha County Sheriff's Office tells TMZ the couple had been arguing over their child, and that the victim, Naya's husband, Ryan, did not require any medical attention.\n\nNaya Rivera is facing a domestic battery charge after allegedly attacking her husband, Ryan Dorsey, in West Virginia.\n\nRivera was arrested Saturday night in Chesapeake, WV after Dorsey called cops to report her for hitting him. According to Dorsey, Rivera hit him in the head and the face -- his bottom lip, to be exact -- while they were on a walk with their 2-year-old son.\n\nAccording to the Kanawha County Sheriff's Dept ... Ryan gave the responding deputies a video of the attack, and Naya was taken into custody around 9:30 PM ET.\n\nThe \"Glee\" star appeared before the judge early Sunday morning to be arraigned. She was released on $1,000 bond, and her father-in-law reportedly picked her up from jail.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/bc/16by9/2024/02/28/bc8c8681ae0f4124b0f16af077f18339_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ed/16by9/2024/02/28/eddbc843901a4ceb8b84bd931e42ad20_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ee/o/2017/11/26/ee2c2de134e65cbda38c7508563becad_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a9/16by9/2024/02/28/a98f686fbf1a42f7a040a9ed546b7aab_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/5e/16by9/2024/02/28/5efb2c325a704f47b33716c21232f2c2_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ba/o/2013/11/20/bab5d5a19ec95be7a580db61ec5020ba_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c1/16by9/2017/11/26/c12a792d45ba5085a016b28ef34e9585_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/57/o/2013/11/20/579197caea3f59319b40e35f006a15d8_md.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/97/o/2017/11/26/97187c72190d5e9b9b8583e1eadff67b_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d3/16by9/2024/02/28/d3c7ad9906e849cbb1f1a0824fe05557_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c1/16by9/2017/11/26/c12a792d45ba5085a016b28ef34e9585_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/11/26/naya-rivera-arrested-domestic-violence-battery/", "title": "Naya Rivera Arrested for Domestic Battery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large", "description": "Naya Rivera is facing a domestic battery charge after allegedly attacking her husband, Ryan Dorsey, in West Virginia.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/11/26/naya-rivera-arrested-domestic-violence-battery/", "title": "Naya Rivera Arrested for Domestic Battery", "description": "Naya Rivera is facing a domestic battery charge after allegedly attacking her husband, Ryan Dorsey, in West Virginia.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c1/16by9/2017/11/26/c12a792d45ba5085a016b28ef34e9585_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Naya Rivera Arrested for Domestic Battery", "description": "Naya Rivera is facing a domestic battery charge after allegedly attacking her husband, Ryan Dorsey, in West Virginia.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c1/16by9/2017/11/26/c12a792d45ba5085a016b28ef34e9585_xl.jpg"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.rhythmnewmedia.tmz&referrer=utm_source%3Dsmartbanner%26utm_medium%3Dnative%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartbanner%26anid%3Dadmob", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, affiliate-data=ct=Smart_Banner&pt=201436, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2017/11/26/naya-rivera-arrested-domestic-violence-battery/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511625600.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
