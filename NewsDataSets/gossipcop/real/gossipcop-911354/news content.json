News has confirmed the 25-year-old recently completed a two-week treatment programme for depression and anxiety.\n\n\u2018She had a difficult year, especially towards the end, and she decided she wanted to spend some time focusing on herself,\u2019 a source told the news outlet.\n\n\u2018It was all about wellness and her health.\u2019\n\nSelena reportedly sought professional help in New York City, months after she unfollowed her mother, Mandy Teefey, on Instagram following rumours the pair had argued over her rekindled romance with Justin.\n\nE! News reports Bieber was aware of Gomez\u2019s decision to seek treatment and fully supported her decision.\n\n\u2018She wanted to get back to a healthy place,\u2019 a source added. \u2018She feels great.\u2019\n\nIn 2016, the \u2018Bad Liar\u2019 singer cancelled 34 remaining dates on her Revival world tour to seek treatment at a Tennessee facility to help her with anxiety, panic attacks and depression.\n\nPicking up the award for favourite female pop/rock artist at the AMAs that year, the singer-turned-actress revealed: \u2018I was absolutely broken inside.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not trying to get validation nor do I need it anymore. All I can say is that from the bottom of my heart I\u2019m so grateful to be able to share what I love every single day with the people that I love.\u2019\n\nThe news of Gomez\u2019s recent treatment comes a day after the rumoured couple were spotted attending a church service and hockey match together in Los Angeles.\n\n\u2018They were very happy to see everyone there and were giving lot of hugs and saying hello as they entered,\u2019 an eyewitness told E! News. \u2018They both seemed happy and relaxed.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re glad to see Gomez prioritising her health.\n\nVia: ELLE UK", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/rising-sign-astrology-kendall-jenner.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/SelenaGomez-Main.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/Group.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/1517621695798_SelenaGomez-Social.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/09/SELENA-KIDNEY.jpg?resize=380%2C304&ssl=1", "https://www.elle.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/02/elle-australia-editors-letter-march-2024-grace-oneil.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/03/elle-launch-event.jpg?resize=720%2C405&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/1517621468463_Selena-Gomez-Instagram-Main.jpg?resize=1024%2C853&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/02/Elle-Cover.jpg?resize=731%2C1024&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/10/L-1.jpg?resize=380%2C304&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/1517621695798_SelenaGomez-Social.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com.au/culture/celebrity/selena-gomez-treatment-anxiety-15760/", "title": "Selena Gomez Completes Treatment For Depression And Anxiety", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Selena Gomez completed two weeks of treatment in New York City for depression and anxiety at the beginning of 2018.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez Completes Treatment For Depression And Anxiety", "description": "The 25-year-old has been seeking treatment for her mental health, months after she had a high-profile spat with her mother, Mandy Teefey", "url": "https://www.elle.com.au/culture/celebrity/selena-gomez-treatment-anxiety-15760/", "site_name": "ELLE", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/1517621695798_SelenaGomez-Social.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-03T01:25:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-12-02T14:15:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "2 minutes", "label2": "Written by", "data2": "Katie O'Malley"}, "sailthru.date": "2018-02-03 01:25:10", "sailthru.title": "Selena Gomez Completes Treatment For Depression And Anxiety", "sailthru.author": "Katie O'Malley", "sailthru.description": "<p>The 25-year-old has been seeking treatment for her mental health, months after she had a high-profile spat with her mother, Mandy Teefey</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/SelenaGomez-Main.jpg?fit=1427%2C1189&ssl=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/02/SelenaGomez-Main.jpg?fit=50%2C42&ssl=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/cropped-ElleFavIcon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mVznTEOR1I?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-AU&autohide=2&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1517621110.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com.au", "summary": ""}
