She\u2019s even the voice of Pixar\u2019s bumbling but lovable Dory. She\u2019s beloved by many for her warm, fun-loving style. But the one person who matters most is her wife. In a message she wrote to partner Portia de Rossi on their ninth wedding anniversary, she honored \u201cwife\u201d as her greatest title.\n\nOn the big day, she posted a photo of the two on the day they got married and captioned the snap, \u201c@PortiadeRossi and I got married 9 years ago today. Being her wife is the greatest thing I am.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX3e2qkFl1_/?hl=en&taken-by=theellenshow\n\nHow sweet!\n\nDe Rossi also shared a message to her love, writing, \u201cWe\u2019ve been together so long that not only do we look like kids in this picture, but it was taken with a camera! Happy 9th, Thing,\u201d to accompany a photo taken on film.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX4Bbj1jqDW/?hl=en&taken-by=portiaderossi\n\nDeGeneres reposted that message and wrote \u201cI love my wife.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, these two are full of love and happiness remembering the day they said \u201cI Do.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi were married in an intimate ceremony held at their L.A. home in 2008. At the time, de Rossi told People, \u201c[Getting married]is not something we\u2019ve ever taken for granted. That we get to do this, it means a lot.\u201d\n\nAnd nine years later\u2014they\u2019re still not taking it for granted!\n\nGetty Images | Christopher Polk\n\nRumors of a breakup were circling around (as they often do for celebrity couples), but DeGeneres quickly put those rumors to bed.\n\nIn an interview with People, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no best part [about being married.] It\u2019s everything. I can\u2019t imagine not being married. I have my best friend, the person I want to spend time with more than anybody else in the world.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to a place where I really am just settled. Really. I know that I\u2019m not going anywhere. She\u2019s not going anywhere. I\u2019m not saying the relationship took a while; I\u2019m saying in my life, it took a while to find this.\u201d\n\nThe two have created a rock solid relationship, and we couldn\u2019t be happier for them on their anniversary. Here\u2019s to plenty more to come!", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20665%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/simplemost_logo_-e1705618882948.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201926'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2045%2045'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201194'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ic_scripps.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20126'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AP19192545563396-e1611845593928-750x422.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20406'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Ellen-DeGeneres-e1705955328557-1200x676.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/461142064_Portia-de-Rossi.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/461142624_Ellen-DeGeneres.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20720'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20405'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/simplemost_logo_hover_-e1705618911271.png", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Judge-Judy-658x500.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20658%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/71PeRFPw50L._AC_SL1500_-665x800.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cerave-night-cream.webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20919%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/augusta-120x120.png", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/AP226070348535-e1675444208838-750x422.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2096%2096'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/71JqPgwUuIL._AC_SL1500_-919x800.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/461142064_Portia-de-Rossi.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Augusta Statz", "I Have A B.F.A.
