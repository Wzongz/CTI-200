Not that Upside Down \u2014 they stopped by a random parking lot to test her theory that she sings better upside-down.

Pink revealed another big theory \u2014 that it\u2019s sweet when husbands tell you how their wives are doing before they mention themselves. James was real doubtful of that one.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ab4/307/2b7c5386ea6e8d5cb491ce565833d4494e-hunter-harris-2019.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5c6/e21/a93a6ed8b74933b35acfa3f5bc3f029174-shame-of-hating-bedtime.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/74c/3f3/ee9ac056b3f48f07f3af77021794ece26d-0524-Cov-4x5-B.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b26/5db/8007bf3c3a74fb259530abbbebd39791a8-AP19309051729947.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8d0/3ba/4f7460e4ab2c2eb76250ba7d7ff17e8590-15-carpool-karaoke-pink.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ecc/963/4deec83b16e4aefff323dbc582142664b8-ErinnSpringer-AdelleWaldman-TheCut-2-1x1.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8d0/3ba/4f7460e4ab2c2eb76250ba7d7ff17e8590-15-carpool-karaoke-pink.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hunter Harris", "A Freelance Writer Who Covers Film", "Music"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/pinks-carpool-karaoke-upside-down-singing.html", "title": "Pink\u2019s Carpool Karaoke Takes a Detour for Some Upside-Down Singing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "carpool karaoke, pink, james corden, music, tv, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Pink\u2019s Carpool Karaoke Takes a Detour for Some Upside-Down Singing", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/pinks-carpool-karaoke-upside-down-singing.html", "description": "James Corden and Pink tested her theory that she sings better upside-down.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8d0/3ba/4f7460e4ab2c2eb76250ba7d7ff17e8590-15-carpool-karaoke-pink.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Pink\u2019s Carpool Karaoke Takes a Detour to the Upside Down", "description": "James Corden and Pink tested her theory that she sings better upside-down.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8d0/3ba/4f7460e4ab2c2eb76250ba7d7ff17e8590-15-carpool-karaoke-pink.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hunteryharris", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-15T14:25:49.031Z", "tag": "carpool karaoke, pink, james corden, music, tv", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "James Corden and Pink tested her theory that she sings better upside-down on the latest Carpool Karaoke.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "carpool karaoke, pink, james corden, music, tv", "author": "Hunter Harris", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510755949.031, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
