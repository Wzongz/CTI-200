I find it tasteless and infuriating,\u201d Pryor wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cAt least get the details right, but of course we live in the age of faux news is real unless we disagree for our own agendas, and people need to stay relevant by dishing dirt.\u201d\n\nThe comedian\u2019s daughter pushed back at a Vulture interview in which prolific music producer Quincy Jones first made the claim, saying Pryor would \u201cf\u2014 anything. Anything! He\u2019d f\u2014 a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.\u201d\n\nJones was then backed up by Pryor\u2019s widow, Jennifer, who also spoke to Vulture. \u201cInstead of putting labels on it, Richard just saw himself as a sexualized creature, who wasn\u2019t afraid of exploration and experimentation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the \u201970s, of course, we were all doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy did NOT have relations with Brando. There were no trips to his South Pacific Oasis, no flowers or love notes between. Not even a film role,\u201d Rain, whose mother is Pryor\u2019s second wife Shelley R. Bonus, wrote in her post.\n\n\u201cBottom line. This man Richard Pryor, is not your Hollyweird scandal performance,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe is our Daddy. He is our perfect imperfection. He is our legacy and we are most certainly his. So get a life and focus back on what\u2019s really going on in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a separate post, Rain took aim at Jones specifically, referring to him as a \u201cbrilliant music producer who is losing his mind.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rain-Pryor.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/COVER-RGB_OW_022024_Cover_IR2-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rain-Pryor.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reid Nakamura", "Tv Reporter", "Reid.Nakamura Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/richard-pryors-daughter-says-father-didnt-sleep-marlon-brando/", "title": "Richard Pryor\u2019s Daughter Says Her Father Didn\u2019t Sleep With Marlon Brando", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Richard Pryor's Daughter Says Her Father Didn't Sleep With Marlon Brando - TheWrap", "description": "\"Why this sudden need to drag Daddy through the Hollywood mud?\" Rain Pryor asks, \"I find it tasteless and infuriating\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/richard-pryors-daughter-says-father-didnt-sleep-marlon-brando/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rain-Pryor.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-02-10T00:35:05+00:00"}, "author": "Reid Nakamura", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Reid Nakamura", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "article-tags": "marlon_brando, quincy_jones, rain-pryor, richard_pryor", "article-section": "media", "article-categories": "culture, media, movies", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518222905.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
