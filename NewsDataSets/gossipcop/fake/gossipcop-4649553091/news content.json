Since he was fired from Today, Bush has not had a job, and allegedly took a killing on his New York City townhouse he bought when he thought he\u2019d be moving to New York for Today.\n\nDWTS has been the place that stars go to either take a victory lap, or say they are sorry through dance, says the Inquisitr. Billy Bush left Today with many of his co-workers angry with him, after a video was released of him palling around with Donald Trump, talking about grabbing women against their will, and what you can do when you are entitled. Just after his exit, DWTS was showing interest in Bush, but at the time, his agent brushed them off, perhaps assuming that other offers would come rolling in, but they haven\u2019t.\n\n\u2018Desperate\u2019 Billy Bush Begging To Be Cast On \u2018DWTS\u2019 https://t.co/CPQNpIXobq via @radar_online \u2014 Wackymoe (@wackymoe) February 10, 2017\n\nRadar Online is saying that \u201cdisgraced former Today show host\u201d Billy Bush is desperate to salvage what is left of his career with a spot on DWTS. A production insider associated with DWTS says that Bush is \u201cbegging to be on the cast of DWTS Season 24.\u201d\n\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\n\nBilly Bush \u2018Today Show\u2019 Colleagues Comment On His Suspension\n\nThe Real Reason The \u2018Today Show\u2019 And NBC Won\u2019t Be Taking Billy\u2026\n\nBilly Bush Lawyer Says Bush\u2019s Career May Have Ended In 2005 If He\u2026\n\n\u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019 Assumes Billy Bush Is Done, Wants Him To\u2026\n\nAnd Billy Bush supposedly is willing to do whatever he needs to do to get a spot on the cast.\n\n\u201cBilly said he would be willing to take a pay cut, and take a sum much lower than the other contestants.\u201d\n\nBut sources are saying that many of the executives at ABC are having serious problems with allowing Billy Bush to come aboard Season 24 of DWTS. It seems that there are still plenty of people who want nothing to do with him, and think he would be negative for the ratings.\n\n\u201cThe higher-ups are tired of having celebs wanting to join DWTS as a way of doing damage control.\u201d\n\nAn example of this would be Ryan Lochte, who signed up for DWTS as a way to say he was sorry for embarrassing the American men\u2019s swim team after lying about an incident at the Rio Olympics.\n\n\u201cA lot of them are also sick of having contestants who want to be cast as a way of reviving their broken career, which is exactly what some believe Billy is trying to do!\u201d\n\nThe Observer says that Billy Bush is due for a win, after losing his job on Today, and reportedly taking a million dollar loss on his Chelsea townhouse. Bush bought the townhouse at 224 West 22nd Street after getting the Today job for $8.8 million, and then tried to relist it for $9 million.\n\nAfter no bites, the price was lowered, and finally, Bush accepted an offer of $7.43 million. The house has now been stripped, and is ready for whatever the new owners plan to do with it. But don\u2019t feel too bad for Bush, because he has some other nice real estate holdings to visit now that he has officially sold his Chelsea place. Bush owns an Encino ranch-estate, and a home in Park City, Utah.\n\nDo you think that the producers at DWTS will give Billy Bush one of the positions on Season 24 of the ABC dance competition?\n\n[Featured Image by Craig Barritt/Getty Images]", "images": ["http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/676355/uploads/7b038e70-cf09-11ee-915e-4bbb053bdf4f_800_420.jpeg", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/673965/uploads/9b546b40-cbee-11ee-8848-33e324d49fff_800_420.jpeg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/640362/uploads/b847e3b0-4004-11ee-8d72-1577bd7486a8_800_420.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/676378/uploads/460ef390-cf12-11ee-8376-b966fb8977a0_800_420.jpeg", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/google-follow-us.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/676504/uploads/3449a000-cfb3-11ee-98e8-e51a05918eaa_800_420.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Feinstein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3967677/is-today-billy-bush-begging-to-be-on-dwts-even-willing-to-take-pay-cut", "title": "Is Billy Bush Begging To Be On \u2018DWTS 2017?\u2019 [UPDATE]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "UPDATE: 2/13/2017: Billy Bush is officially on the new season of DWTS.
