Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was \u201cblindsided\u201d by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a \u201chush-hush annulment.\u201d\n\nSubscribe To Our Newsletters \u2014 And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox\n\nThe smell test: For the love of Liverpool \u2014 this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It\u2019s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she\u2019s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn\u2019t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we\u2019re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what\u2019s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even \u201chush-hush annulments\u201d are a matter of public record. The Enquirer\u2019s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service) probably \u201cscrubbed the records\u201d to conceal Markle\u2019s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.", "images": ["https://en-chatelaine.mblycdn.com/ench/resized/2018/04/w767/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-feud.jpeg", "https://en-chatelaine.mblycdn.com/ench/resized/2018/05/w767/Meghan-Markle-secret-first-husband.jpg", "https://en-chatelaine.mblycdn.com/ench/resized/2018/05/1200x630/Meghan-Markle-secret-first-husband.jpg", "https://en-chatelaine.mblycdn.com/ench/resized/2017/11/w767/meghan-markle-prince-harry-relationship-timeline-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://en-chatelaine.mblycdn.com/ench/resized/2018/05/1200x630/Meghan-Markle-secret-first-husband.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://chatelaine.com/living/entertainment/meghan-markle-secret-first-husband/", "title": "Did Meghan Markle Have A Secret First Husband?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Chatelaine", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Did Meghan Markle Have A Secret First Husband? - Chatelaine", "description": "Is there any truth in the latest batch of royal wedding rumours?
