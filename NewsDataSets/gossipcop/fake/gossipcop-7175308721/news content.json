The former New York Giants football star and \u201cLive! with Kelly and Michael\u201d co-host joined the top rated network morning program in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaines, 40, will move to \u201cGMA Day\u201d from the ABC News panel show \u201cThe View,\u201d where she has been a co-host since September 2016.\n\n\u201cGMA Day\u201d will be taped immediately after the two-hour live broadcast in the morning. ABC is using the new hour to replace \u201cThe Chew,\u201d its food-centric talk show that aired in daytime since 2011.\n\nABC briefly experimented with a third hour of \u201cGMA\u201d in 2012 after the network cancelled the daytime talk show \u201cThe Revolution.\u201d But \u201cGMA Day\u201d will be the first time it has fully committed to expanding its morning franchise to another time period.\n\nNBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d has demonstrated success in using its famous brand name beyond the traditional two-hour morning block. The program added the 9 a.m. hour in 2000 and 10 a.m. in 2008 with Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford. The expanded hours give the network more commercials to sell while incurring relatively modest production costs as the programs are done in the same studio as the flagship program.\n\nIn the last year, NBC has departed from the formula with \u201cMegyn Kelly Today,\u201d which airs at 9 a.m. in a separate studio with an audience and a high-priced host, the former Fox News anchor Kelly. The program, launched in 2017, has not been a ratings success.\n\nstephen.battaglio@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter: @SteveBattaglio", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d68870c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1300x683+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F38%2Fce%2F11b877ecc0dd6b1cbc8480bd6d05%2Fla-1532358246-0chfey1n62-snap-image", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/a6/d6/eea0f1094fb281dbea09e0aa79cd/art-caltimes-trademark-3x.png", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5a7b3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1200+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F6f%2Fcb7450ae47c0b2ae35f4d185b396%2Fipiccy-image.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c96dd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x2333+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe7%2F4b%2Fb3dec3d9485cb5c9181fc1d86da5%2Fap22160595648731.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/99d2117/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc2%2Fa0%2Feb866689f596f949548f131f4c67%2Fimg-54e523d8-turbine-la-bio-stephen-battaglio", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bcc0c3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2994x1996+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F39%2Fe0%2F07138e1c42fbacfaaf59f5c36cd3%2Fshoww-29.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/738798f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2656x1771+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fac%2F1e%2F0106255147aeb495a28cfc7c8256%2F1413878-et-2024-sag-awards-show-rg-1842.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5463a18/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4575x3050+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F88%2Fc0%2Fefca0c544f9ab21d40431f8dad50%2Fwendy-williams-honored-with-a-star-on-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame-45953.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7e4e93/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5981x4000+0+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2Fbe%2F0aa50b3d4e19aeb7ec2f2f8cb66f%2Fdesilydic-dulcesloane-diptych-012224.JPG", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c1539e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1744x1166+0+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2F57%2Fe7a3689f4044bd32687148f2e181%2F1246481851-1.JPG", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fecf657/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5062x3385+8+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F91%2Ff0%2F3e5681dc4253b1f8db1454d6dc19%2Fpoppy-harlow95-copy-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d68870c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1300x683+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F38%2Fce%2F11b877ecc0dd6b1cbc8480bd6d05%2Fla-1532358246-0chfey1n62-snap-image", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Stephen Battaglio Writes About Television", "The Media Business For The Los Angeles Times Out Of New York.
