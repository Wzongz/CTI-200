I\u2019m praying it\u2019s for a movie.\u201d\n\nAnd they could be right.\n\nJohnny, who is currently touring with his rock tribute band the Hollywood Vampires, is starring in a new film called Richard Says Goodbye.\n\nIn the film, the actor is portraying Richard \u2013 a college professor who is diagnosed with a terminal illness.\n\nOnlookers who\u2019ve seen Johnny recently agree that this could be the reason behind his drastic transformation.\n\nOne person took to Twitter, advising the photos that sparked concerns were actually misleading.\n\n@its_batcounty claimed they saw Johnny in concert and he looked well.\n\nThe message encouraged others to share their recent Johnny Depp encounters \u2013 all sounding very positive.\n\nJust saw #JohnnyDepp in concert in Hamburg. He looks healthy, happy and he had so much fun. He didn't look sick, pale or thin at all. How pictures can deceive an impression.. \u2014 Swiggity Swag (@its_batcountry) June 2, 2018\n\nI met him 2 weeks ago at Foxwoods and he was in absolute perfect health! Happy, smiling, and his hug was fantastic! He's in great shape! \u2014 VampirezRock \u2620\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7d (@JdeppLove) June 2, 2018\n\nAlso when your head is shaved on the sides it can make you look thinner.\n\nDepp has always been more on the thin side his whole life.\n\nI have seen other pics in the same time frame and he looks fine. He was just probably tired in that one shot of him. \u2014 Donna Faye Palumbo (@palumbo_faye) June 2, 2018\n\nThere was a time when Johnny was deemed Hollywood\u2019s leading heartthrob.\n\nDespite the seemingly reasonable explanation \u2013 some pals close to Johnny are concerned.\n\nChatting to Globe magazine, one insider claimed: \u201cJohnny looks like walking death.\u201d\n\nThey alleged, \u201cHe lost 35 pounds (15-kilos) in a brief amount of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis teeth are rotting, his cheeks are sunken, his hair is thinning and falling out and his body is emaciated.\u201d\n\nAdding, \u201cFriends of Johnny are very worried that he could be succumbing to liver disease after years of abusing his body with booze and drugs. There are also concerns about cancer.\u201d\n\nJohnny is yet to speak to address his change in appearance.", "images": ["https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/womensday_adobe_express-01.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/06/04/1528077190485_b2.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/NTL-Hero-2024-02-24T104819.677-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/35_Mag-Cover-Image-1.png", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/AWW/2016/06/02/27444/Johnny-ART.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/t5_adobe_express.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/03/mardi-gras-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/WomansDay/2013/11/14/10555/johnny-depp.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Vector.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/06/04/1528077260231_b3.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/tvweek_adobe_express-01.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/PTL-logo-3.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/06/04/1528077183624_a2.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/06/04/1528077179898_a1.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/06/04/1528077325587_johnny.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/06/04/1528077470551_CMS.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/NTL-Hero-2024-02-23T145515.663-720x405.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/06/04/1528077470551_CMS.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/celebrity-news/johnny-depp-looks-sick-for-new-film-role-48949/", "title": "Johnny Depp looks unrecognisable\u2026 but we finally know why!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Fans were left shocked when pictures of Johnny Depp surfaced online.
