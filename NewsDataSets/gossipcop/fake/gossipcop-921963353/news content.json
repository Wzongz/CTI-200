They backtracked on all of the incorrect allegations.\n\nThe gossip rag wrote a statement titled, \u201cApology Regarding Judge Judy And Nicole Sheindlin.\" Nicole is Judy's step-daughter with her husband Jerry Sheindlin.\n\nThe message read, \"We and our sister publication, the National Examiner, recently published articles which stated that Judge Judy Sheindlin suffered from \u2018brain disease,\u2019 was \u2018fighting\u2019 both Alzheimer\u2019s and depression, and \u2018is hiding a heartbreaking medical crisis.\u2019 We also published articles which stated that Judge Judy cheated on her husband, and that her daughter Nicole Sheindlin faced jail time for refusing to serve on a jury. None of these statements are true and we unequivocally retract them.\u201d\n\nIt went on, \u201cThe National Enquirer, the National Examiner, and American Media Inc., sincerely apologize to Judge Judy. The National Enquirer, the National Examiner, and American Media Inc., also sincerely apologize to Nicole, who is a respected attorney and is the CEO of Her Honor Mentoring.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/wendy-williams-documentary.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/EmilyBluntMerylStreepAnneHathaway.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/SarahMichelleGellarShannenDohertyThenandNow.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/pedro-pascal-sag-awards-drunk.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/kenneth-mitchell-ALS.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/348/196/ChrisGauthier.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/judge-judy-sheindlin-.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/judge-judy-sheindlin-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/judge-judy-sheindlin-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/judge-judy-gets-apology-for-false-national-enquirer-alzheimer-story", "title": "Judge Judy gets apology for false National Enquirer Alzheimer story", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "Judge Judy had a big win against the National Enquirer.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Judge Judy gets apology for false National Enquirer Alzheimer story", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:c8d70c73-a554-5c20-97f7-620029eb5b14", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-09-20", "dcterms.created": "2017-09-20T12:39:57-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-09-20T16:57:35-04:00", "og": {"title": "Judge Judy gets apology for false National Enquirer Alzheimer story", "description": "Judge Judy had a big win against the National Enquirer.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/judge-judy-sheindlin-.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/judge-judy-gets-apology-for-false-national-enquirer-alzheimer-story", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Judge Judy gets apology for false National Enquirer Alzheimer story", "description": "Judge Judy had a big win against the National Enquirer.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/judge-judy-sheindlin-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/judge-judy-gets-apology-for-false-national-enquirer-alzheimer-story"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment", "classification-tags": "celebrity,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505836800.0, "source": "http://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
