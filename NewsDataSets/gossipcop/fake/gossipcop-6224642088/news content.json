As The Inquisitr previously reported, an article on Radar Online claims that Grande is ready to call it quits because she \u201cregrets\u201d saying yes to Davidson\u2019s proposal so quickly after they started dating.\n\n\u201cAriana didn\u2019t know who Pete really was, and fell in love with the idea of being in love,\u201d a purported insider said in an interview with Radar.\n\nThe reported source added that the \u201cGod Is A Woman\u201d singer\u2019s friends and family, particularly her brother, Frankie J., do not like the relationship.\n\n\u201cAriana wants the fairytale so bad, but Pete has already started to take a toll on her image, and she\u2019s tired of constantly having to stick up for him,\u201d they continued.\n\nBut Gossip Cop is on the case and they report that the story is nothing but fake news. They report that a source close to Grande told them that Radar\u2018s claims are untrue and that Grande and Davidson have no plans to call off their engagement.\n\nThe celebrity news watch-dog also points out that Frankie J, Grande, and Davidson were recently spotted holding hands on the streets of New York. This doesn\u2019t sound like the actions of someone who doesn\u2019t think highly of his sister\u2019s fiance. Furthermore, claims that Ariana is fed up of defending the SNL comedian are hard to believe when she recently stood up for him against her fans. The Inquisitr reported that fans weren\u2019t happy that she\u2019d dedicated a song to Davidson on her upcoming album, Sweetener. The song is appropriately named \u201cPete\u201d and some of her \u201cArianators\u201d expressed that the relationship was too new for Grande to have an entire song about him on the album.\n\nBut she\u2019s standing by her man and her decision.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my fianc\u00e9. This is my album. I\u2019m an honest and emotional artist and human being and if my openness in my work isn\u2019t for you, that\u2019s OK; I won\u2019t be offended,\u201d Grande wrote on Instagram. \u201cStill wishing y\u2019all all the love in the world.\u201d\n\nPete Davidson and Ariana Grande confirmed their relationship back in May after they both ended previous public relationships. Grande called things off with rapper, Mac Miller while Davidson ended things with his previous flame Cazzie David. Since then, they have been prominently featured on each other\u2019s social media pages and they seem to be very much in love with one another.\n\nGrande recently posted a behind-the-scenes video at her \u201cGod Is A Woman\u201d shoot which shows Davidson looking at her performance with an awestruck look on his face. As a previous Inquisitr story also notes that recently, Ariana posted an Instagram story which showed her caring for Pete after his wisdom tooth removal surgery.\n\nSo everything looks happy and they seem to be headed toward a happy ending that includes a wedding. But we\u2019ll only be sure when Ariana Grande walks down the aisle.", "images": ["http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/677268/uploads/0ea0dbe0-d24a-11ee-b2f2-d5d94d857b5a_800_420.jpeg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/640002/uploads/814987e0-3ed5-11ee-a180-85fd2fa13425_800_420.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/677512/uploads/53b9a580-d2f5-11ee-82b6-7f05ab55a701_800_420.jpeg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/640362/uploads/b847e3b0-4004-11ee-8d72-1577bd7486a8_800_420.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/641758/uploads/63537890-45a1-11ee-b3b8-6719e357b7f5_800_420.jpeg", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/google-follow-us.png"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Grannum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4995915/ariana-grande-is-not-calling-off-her-wedding-to-pete-davidson-despite-tabloid-report", "title": "Ariana Grande Is Not Calling Off Her Wedding To Pete Davidson, Despite Tabloid Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson have only been engaged for a couple of weeks but there are already tabloid rumors that say they might be calling off the wedding.
