Photo: Eric Ryan/Getty Images\n\nAs Brad Pitt was not available for an interview about his new luxury furniture line with Frank Pollaro, the Times talked to a bunch of design experts for their thoughts instead. Their observations ranged from \u201cswanky\u201d to \u201cstifled\u201d; one critic noted, \u201cI was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.\u201d Here are our favorite gems (and yes, the Chanel No. 5 ad was referenced):\n\n1. \u201cThe shiny metal surprised me specifically; the mod Trumpian swankiness, in general.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cThese pieces are too nice; I do not hear Mr. Pitt\u2019s voice unleashed with full authority.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cMr. Pitt, you are a great actor. Stay that person, with all of his confidence and drive and risk-taking, when designing. These first pieces are audition monologues; you already have the part.\u201d\n\n4. \u201c[A piece I would want in my home is] possibly the oval table \u2014 in the guest room of a second home, if I owned a second home.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced after seeing three table designs (and a bathtub that reminds me of an ashtray) that Brad Pitt should quit his day job to be in the furniture or product design game. Unless that means I can be an actor for a day and get paid $7 million to star in a Chanel No. 5 perfume ad.\u201d", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/96b/3b8/3114e632f3d2602cca4fcd854dc1b872c5-Awards.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1bb/ea0/9c3f08715f0c6adbef524372f4f9d50194-trumpbidenpolls.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e5f/010/2f4c75fbacb551ae9d0e879b04d2cd48a4-01-brad-pitt-145020159.rvertical.w330.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a2e/291/896a7f58b1dd99a9677575f693b0c399a5-charlotte-cowles.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9cc/774/34a58876b5abc9c79b11d5b16dbfeeda72-shana-moulton-art-secondary.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f88/a5c/4422a5f004922eac1cca38e85d31171e2b-0424CUTCov-4x5-moore-rev.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e5f/010/2f4c75fbacb551ae9d0e879b04d2cd48a4-01-brad-pitt-145020159.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e5f/010/2f4c75fbacb551ae9d0e879b04d2cd48a4-01-brad-pitt-145020159.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Cut S Financial-Advice Columnist.", "In Addition To", "My Two Cents", "She Writes About Work", "Parenting For The Site.
