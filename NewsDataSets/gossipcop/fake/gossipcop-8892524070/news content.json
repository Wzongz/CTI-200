But we can\u2019t help but wonder what Meghan Markle\u2019s dating rap sheet looks like?\n\nWhile we all know who Prince Harry\u2019s ex-girlfriends are (looking at you, Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas) \u2013 Meghan\u2019s love life history is still as mysterious as the Crown Jewels.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look back at the \u2018frogs\u2019 Meghan had to kiss before she found her prince\u2026\n\nLoading the player...\n\nThe one before the one: Canadian chef, Cory Vitiello, 2014-2016\n\nBreak-ups always suck, so spare a thought for poor old Cory Vitiello, who was reportedly given the flick shortly after Meghan met Harry in 2016.\n\nA besotted Meghan even featured Cory on her now defunct lifestyle blog The Tig, but the post has since been removed.\n\nThe [UK Telegraph] claims the Suits star was an item with the successful celebrity chef for two years and they were together when Meghan hit it off with Harry in July, 2016.\n\nAt the time, a friend close of the exes addressed speculation Harry could have played a part in their demise, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t comment on that.\u201d\n\nJust before they broke up, Cory praised his significant other for working with World Vision.\n\n\u201cSo proud of my lady @meghanmarkle being named Global Ambassador for @worldvision #worldwaterday,\u201d he penned.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CoryVitiello/status/712342063027765250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bustle.com%2Fp%2Fwho-has-meghan-markle-dated-besides-prince-harry-a-look-at-the-suits-stars-romantic-past-41131\n\nCory and Meghan lived together in Toronto and were said to be together when Meghan first met Harry.\n\nBut was it always just going to be a flash in the pan?\n\n\u201cThey were a very handsome pair and well suited, but you got the impression it was a sometimes superficial relationship,\u201d an insider revealed to The Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cCory was always very focused on his job and his work. In that respect, they both put their careers first. The relationship came second.\u201d\n\nA celebrity chef who can cook a mean carbonara? Almost as good as a Prince!\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, Meghan, who lived with the foodie in a townhouse in Toronto, was \u201cgoing through a tough time with her previous boyfriend\u201d when Prince Harry \u201cbesieged her with texts until she agreed to a date\u201d.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry about Cory, he\u2019s doing just fine! The gun cook is a regular guest star on lifestyle shows and runs a string of successful restaurants in Toronto.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no downside to being a well-known chef. There are thousands of great cooks in the city, and there are chefs who are more deserving of the celebrity than myself,\u201d he told Toronto Life in 2016 of his high profile.\n\nWATCH: Cory talks about his career. Post continues\u2026\n\nThe fleeting fling: Irish pro golfer, Rory McIlroy, 2014\n\nBefore Cory, there was a Rory!\n\nThough never officially confirmed, these two were joined at the hip for a hot second back in August, 2014.\n\nRelive their ice bucket challenge video in the player below. Post continues below\u2026\n\nLoading the player...\n\nTheir ice bucket video was a hole in one! But nothing serious ever eventuated between the actress and the pro golfer.\n\nRomance rumours stepped up a notch after Meghan and Rory starred in a very flirty ice bucket challenge video together.\n\nThey were also spotted enjoying several cosy dinner dates in New York and Dublin, but sources at the time denied their romance to the Irish Independent .\n\nAfter this pic of Meghan and Rory was posted on Instagram, people were convinced they were a couple.\n\nThe ex-husband: American film producer, Trevor Engelson, 2004-2013\n\nWe like our princesses to be modern and relatable.\n\nAnd Meghan\u2019s failed marriage to American producer Trevor Engelson makes us love her even more \u2013 because in this day and age, who seriously hasn\u2019t had a doomed relationship.\n\nAfter dating for six years, Meghan and Trevor, who owns his own production company called Underground, became engaged in 2010.\n\nIn September, 2011, they tied the knot in an extravagant beach-side wedding at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. There were over 100 guests in attendance and the celebrations kicked on for days (hopefully she\u2019ll do something just as fun with Harry.)\n\nTheir marriage lasted just two years, and by September 2013 they had quietly separated.\n\nSources close to the couple claim Meghan\u2019s role on Suits, which was filmed in Toronto, played a part in their demise.\n\n\u201cIt put a strain on the relationship. Trevor was in LA making movies, Meghan was in another country five hours\u2019 flight away and it simply took its toll,\u201d a friend told The Daily Mail.\n\nAlthough the exes don\u2019t share any kids, the controversial concept was dreamt up after Trevor was chatting to his fellow producer Dan Farah, speculating what it would have been like if they did have to share custody of children.\n\n\u201cMe and my lady in London,\u201d Trevor penned back in 2010 next to this snap. The film producer married Meghan in 2011.\n\nPreviously, sources told Woman\u2019s Day that the producer had been offered more than $1 million to write a tell-all book about his short-lived marriage to the star.\n\nInsiders allege that Trevor has been asked to spill details about his and Meghan\u2019s sex life, Meghan\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage breakdown, allegations of diva antics and temper tantrums on the part of the actress, and even shock claims Meghan had \u201can emotional affair\u201d during their marriage!\n\nInsiders claim their hectic work schedules led to their divorce.\n\nObsessed with the royals?
