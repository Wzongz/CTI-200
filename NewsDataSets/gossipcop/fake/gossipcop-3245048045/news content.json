Each bit of information that reaches the media is being treated like a chess move in a big game of Who Gets to Keep Their Reputation.\n\nAngelina Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged altercation between Brad Pitt and their son Maddox on a private plane. The only info that we, the reading public had at first was that she cited irreconcilable differences, and was trying to get sole custody of their children. Wanting sole custody seemed significant, even before reports of Pitt\u2019s drinking began to surface.\n\nNow that Marion Cotillard has denied any involvement in the separation, the media focus is more and more on how Pitt interacts with his children. Is he a man who drinks and emotionally or physically abuses his family when intoxicated? Or is Angelina Jolie exaggerating one family argument so she can get custody, then jet off to the U.N., as the Pitt camp alleges? It all kind of hinges on some recorded evidence of the inciting incident that supposedly led to Jolie\u2019s filing.\n\nLainey Gossip devoted a long blog Friday to the way in which Brad Pitt has been trying to set up the video of his argument with Jolie and Maddox, a video that has not yet been released, but likely will judging from the way Pitt\u2019s PR is trying to lay the groundwork. She points out that Pitt\u2019s team has clearly chosen People as their tabloid of choice, and in a post literally titled \u201cBrad\u2019s Side of the Story\u201d they have carefully crafted how we should read the abuse allegations. As Lainey writes:\n\nYou know what\u2019s interesting though? PEOPLE\u2019s version of \u201cBrad\u2019s side of the story\u201d has been amended. The one that\u2019s up on the site right now has been edited. Originally when they posted the article last night, this is how it read:\n\nThe source says Pitt did not hurt his son. \u201cHe is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was nose to nose and was spiraling out of control.\u201d\n\nYou see the difference? The detail about Brad and presumably Maddox going \u201cnose to nose\u201d?\n\nAlso this sentence has been removed from the paragraph that now ends with \u201cattempts to gain custody\u201d:\n\nThe Pitt source adds that the star \u201cwas not black-out drunk\u201d and that \u201che absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.\u201d\n\nBrad\u2019s team doesn\u2019t want you visualising him going \u201cnose to nose\u201d with his 15 year old son. And they certainly don\u2019t want you suspecting that he may have been \u201cblack-out drunk\u201d. Just, you know, regular drunk. But drunk enough that Brad\u2019s people can\u2019t straight up deny it. And drunk enough and angry enough that his people cannot categorically dismiss the reports that there was all kinds of drama on that plane.\n\nIt seems like this video will be seen by the public, either through a \u201cleak\u201d or the divorce proceedings, and both sides are prepping public perceptions for how it should be received. As with Amber Heard and Johnny Depp (the latter of whom is represented by the same lawyer as Jolie), how you are seen by the world when you\u2019re a celebrity has a big sway on how you will be treated when you come out on the other side of an ugly divorce.", "images": ["https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2023/12/jezebel-logo-1200x675-1.png"], "top_img": "https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2023/12/jezebel-logo-1200x675-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.jezebel.com/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitts-divorce-is-a-master-class-1786998912", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Is a Master Class in PR Spins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "viewport-fit=cover, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0", "fb": {"admins": 1185614656, "app_id": 127550380613969, "pages": 18512903240}, "p": {"domain_verify": "8f36922bc91ba221f10d82c407d8b6a9"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Since 2007, Jezebel has been the Internet's most treasured source for everything celebrities, sex, and politics...with teeth.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Is a Master Class in PR Spins", "description": "Since 2007, Jezebel has been the Internet's most treasured source for everything celebrities, sex, and politics...with teeth.", "url": "https://www.jezebel.com/angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitts-divorce-is-a-master-class-1786998912", "site_name": "Jezebel", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2023/12/jezebel-logo-1200x675-1.png", "width": 676, "height": 380, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Jezebel"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Is a Master Class in PR Spins", "site": "@jezebel"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2023/12/cropped-icon-512x512-1-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://jezebel.com", "summary": ""}
