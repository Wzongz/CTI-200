That\u2019s the claim being made by the National Enquirer. They say that the \u201cwild child\u201d daughter of Michael Jackson has gone completely off the rails and that her family is concerned that she might be doing drugs to cope with the stress of her new modelling and acting career.\n\nBut Gossip Cop has looked into the rumors that Paris is currently doing drugs now, and it looks like they are false.\n\n\u201cThe family worries the stress of Paris\u2019s booming modeling and acting career has catapulted her into substance abuse,\u201d one \u2018source\u2019 said to the National Enquirer, as reported by Gossip Cop.\n\nThe Enquirer also claims that The Jacksons are concerned about health of the matriarch and patriarch of the family, Katherine and Joe. \u201cThe Jackson parents, both in their 80s, are fading fast,\u201d the source claims.\n\nParis had a very difficult adolescence after her father died. In an interview with Rolling Stone, she revealed that she was sexually assaulted at age 14. She also admitted she had cut herself, attempted suicide \u201cmultiple times,\u201d and had been using drugs as well. Tattoos now cover the scars and track marks from the drug abuse.\n\nBut as for whether she is using drugs now, Gossip Cop interviewed her press rep who told them that the claims made by the National Enquirer were unfounded.\n\nSince her stint in rehab, Paris seems to be doing a lot better. She\u2019s currently signed to IMG models and has started acting as well, with a recent guest role on Fox\u2019s Star.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the National Enquirer has made up stories about Paris Jackson. They previously claimed that Paris was set to join Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and that Kris Jenner was trying to recruit Jackson into their clan. The whole goal of this \u201crecruitment\u201d was to help boost the ratings of their flagship reality TV show. But this story was debunked by Gossip Cop along with another Enquirer story which said that Paris was dating Trevor Donovan. An interview with Paris\u2019 rep revealed that she and Donovan are just friends and there\u2019s no romantic link between them.\n\nDo you think that Paris Jackson has relapsed into drug abuse or is Michael Jackson\u2019s only daughter doing just fine, in your opinion?
