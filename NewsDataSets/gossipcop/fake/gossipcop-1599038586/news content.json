However, considering his lack of motivation, as mentioned by the insider, it seems as if Harley is getting paid to do nothing other than watch Kanye stand around and refuse to take part in the exercises.\n\nThe outlet quotes its source as saying that the fitness studio in Woodland Hills has become one of Kanye West\u2019s favorites. And though he has the drive and dedication to get in the best shape possible, upon arriving at the facility, he ends up doing little to nothing, the source alleges.\n\n\u201cHarley shows Kanye how to do a certain exercise on a machine, Kanye nods in agreement and then they walk over to another machine and do the same thing,\u201d the insider explains.\n\nThe source adds that despite all the efforts the trainer makes to push West in the right direction, to get the fit body he wants, the father of three just doesn\u2019t seem to be interested.\n\nOf course, the rumor concerning Kanye West\u2019s laziness at the gym comes just weeks after it was claimed that the aging rapper is still recovering from his infamous meltdown in November.\n\nIt\u2019s being said that in the hopes of clearing his mind from his negative thoughts, West has been working on recording new music for his forthcoming album, Complex reveals, but there\u2019s no rush, as he\u2019s mainly focused on getting his mind on the right path.\n\nConsidering the supposed fact that Kanye is easily distracted once he gets to the gym, it would seem to fans that the rap icon has a long way to go before he can say he has fully recovered from his mental breakdown, which left him hospitalized for eight days.\n\nWould you be surprised by the news that Kanye West is lazy when it comes to hitting the gym? Is his mental breakdown to blame?\n\n[Featured Image by Victor Boyko/Getty Images]", "images": ["http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/677268/uploads/0ea0dbe0-d24a-11ee-b2f2-d5d94d857b5a_800_420.jpeg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/640002/uploads/814987e0-3ed5-11ee-a180-85fd2fa13425_800_420.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/677512/uploads/53b9a580-d2f5-11ee-82b6-7f05ab55a701_800_420.jpeg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/640362/uploads/b847e3b0-4004-11ee-8d72-1577bd7486a8_800_420.png", "http://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/641758/uploads/63537890-45a1-11ee-b3b8-6719e357b7f5_800_420.jpeg", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/google-follow-us.png"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maurice Cassidy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4313038/kanye-west-lazy-hires-personal-trainer-but-doesnt-work-out-amid-meltdown-recovery", "title": "Kanye West Reportedly Lazy, Hires Personal Trainer But Doesn\u2019t Work Out Amid Meltdown Recovery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kanye West goes to the gym as often as he can with his personal trainer, Harley Pasternak, but according to a report, the rapper doesn&#8217;t actually work out once he arrives at the gym.
