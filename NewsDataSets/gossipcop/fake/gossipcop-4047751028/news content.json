A gunman opened fire during a congressional baseball practice, and President Trump, Lin-Manuel Miranda, George Takei, and other celebrities are responding in its aftermath.\n\n\u201cRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with him.\u201d Other politicians raising their voices include Senator Kamala Harris, who called the shooting \u201chorrific,\u201d and Congressman Ted Lieu, who wrote, \u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with the victims injured by this senseless shooting in Alexandria today.\u201d\n\nShortly after 7 a.m. ET, Alexandria police were notified of a shooting at E. Monroe Street. Police Chief Michael Brown gave a statement on the situation to press after a suspect was taken into custody and five people were transported to local hospitals.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the gunman was carrying a rifle and was wounded by return fire from officers. Scalise was taken to George Washington University Hospital in stable condition. Republican Senator Jeff Flake told the AP, \u201cWe were doing batting practice. All of a sudden we heard a very loud shot. The gunman was over by the third base dugout with a clear view of the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shooting in Alexandria this AM was a senseless horrific act,\u201d Takei tweeted. \u201cMy thoughts are with Rep. Scalise, the Capitol Police & all those impacted.\u201d Miranda also offered his \u201cprayers and thoughts,\u201d while Katie Couric asked, \u201cGod what is happening in this country?\u201d\n\nSee
