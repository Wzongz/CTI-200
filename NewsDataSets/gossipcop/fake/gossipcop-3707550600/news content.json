But the red heels I think not only look good on me but also fit, so I steal them after the show.\u201d\n\nHe came out to his first wife by accident 3 \u201cI told Chrystie in 1973 about my gender issues. It wasn\u2019t by choice: she was putting clothes away and noticed a rubber band on one of the hooks of her bra. When she asked me about it, my first response was noncommittal.\u201d\n\nHer marriage to second wife, Linda, ended when she caught him in women\u2019s clothing 4 \u201cIn that room I felt she was revolted by me. I know she did not mean to, but her reaction was my greatest fear realized.\u201d\n\nA friend once spotted Caitlyn, dressed in drag while driving his Porsche, forcing Jenner to say he was wearing a costume for Halloween 5 \u201cI\u2019m driving on Santa Monica Boulevard\u2026 and am at a stoplight when my next-door neighbor pulls up to me. I can tell he is surprised\u2026 it was a close call.\u201d\n\nShe uses household items to help her look more feminine, such as when it comes to sticking her wig on tightly 6 \u201cThere is only one drawback to Krazy Glue: it can sometimes stick to your skin so much that it takes a little piece of skin with it when you pull it off.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, Jenner set aside a bedroom in her home strictly for her women\u2019s clothing collection 7 \u201cMy mom visits me once, sees them, and is happy I have a girlfriend.\u201d\n\nA revelation in 1989 prompted her marriage to Kris 8 (Getty) \u201cI stop going through transition in 1989. I can\u2019t do this to my kids. I can\u2019t do this to me. I can\u2019t do this to society. It is not ready. I have to get back in the game. I have to once again establish Bruce as the dominant presence, no matter how much I loathe him. I need cover again\u2026. Which is when Kris Kardashian and Bruce Jenner improbably find each other.\u201d\n\nKris knew Bruce was transgender from day one \u2026 according to Caitlyn 9 (Getty) \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2013 everyone wants to know, Kris and I [had] good and frequent sex at the beginning,\u201d Caitlyn says, describing the sex as \u201cimbued with love\u201d but admits she wasn\u2019t \u201centirely comfortable\u201d with the act of making love to Kris Jenner. \u201cI tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her. This will always be a subject of dispute between us. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn, which obviously means in her mind that she did not know enough.\u201d\n\nWhen Caitlyn married Kris, she underwent breast reduction surgery, telling the doctors her boobs were the result of steroid use 10 (Getty) \u201cThe procedure is easy. He basically liposuctions them out, and from the vantage point of looking like a normal father I do look much better. But from the vantage point of myself I am sad.\u201d\n\nDuring her marriage to Kris, his other half controls nearly everything 11 \u201cI do not have a checking account. I have a credit card, but purchases are carefully pored over. Kris is incredibly generous \u2013 on her terms.\u201d\n\nShe hid in the closet \u2026 literally 12 \u201cI have bought makeup how-to books,\u201d Cait recalls. \u201cI keep the [makeup] books, along with my meager collection of clothing, in a small closet with a lock in the back of my closet. Kris and I have negotiated this,\u201d she recalls of that time period, \u201csince she is terrified, as I am, of the kids finding something.\u201d\n\nPost-marriage to Kris, Caitlyn left her four oldest kids behind 13 \u201cI had to do whatever it took to make them a part of my life. I needed to assert myself. But I could not. So I let go of them, which is a softer way of saying I abandoned them. Because I did abandon them.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn believes O.J. Simpson was a killer and says Robert Kardashian agreed 14 (Getty) \u201c[Robert Kardashian] said, \u2018I would\u2019ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial.\u2019 The implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty. [O.J.] was the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest a\u2013hole in the world of sports I had ever seen, and I had seen a lot of them. I believe he got away with two savage murders.\u201d\n\nThis is what Jenner said Kris told her about being transgender: 15 \u201cTake Caitlyn on the road \u2014 but she is not to play in our home or hometown.\u201d\n\nWhy did Caitlyn push the Kardashians aside when she came out? 16 \u201cThe Kardashian side feels slighted by their noticeable absence. They are right to feel slighted. They were slighted on purpose because of research showing that any time a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money\u2026. After all of the time it took to get here, I needed to make clear that this was real, this is my life and not some publicity stunt.\u201d\n\nShe chose to officially/physically reassign her gender because\u2026 17 \u201cI just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking in the damn thing all the time.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not focused on her sex life, even if the public is 18 (Getty) \u201cI don\u2019t have the appetite for [sex], which is why the public\u2019s obsession over [my gender confirmation surgery] is annoying. It hearkens back to this misperception that people transition because of their sexual desires.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/thg-placeholder.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201692%202560'%3E%3Crect%20width='1692'%20height='2560'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20500'%3E%3Crect%20width='500'%20height='500'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/thg-placeholder-335x335.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0223_hannahgosselin_02_crop-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/Porsha-Williams-1-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/caitlyn-jenner-in-red-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0222_wendywilliams_header-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1004_rhobh_s13_05-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0223_andrewlincoln_header-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/caitlyn-jenner-strikes-a-pose-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1095004178-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0223_princeharry_princewilliam_header-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20335%20335'%3E%3Crect%20width='335'%20height='335'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201781%202560'%3E%3Crect%20width='1781'%20height='2560'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/0209_jingerduggar_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black-150x150.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/slideshows/caitlyn-jenner-14-stunning-quotes-from-her-memoir/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Read the 19 Most Stunning Quotes From Her Memoir", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Read the 19 Most Stunning Quotes From Her Memoir", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner\u00a0says she doesn't really talk to the Kardashians anymore.
