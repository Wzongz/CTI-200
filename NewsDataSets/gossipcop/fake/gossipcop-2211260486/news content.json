Daddario told People today at a Kleenex Wet Wipes launch party that, \u201cWe\u2019re very good friends. Zac and I\u2019ve worked together, and we\u2019re very good friends.\u201d\n\nShe previously made it clear they were only friends to the press in May 2017, so one whole year ago. \"I don't know that I started it,\" she told E! during Baywatch press when asked about the dating rumor. \"We work together closely; he's my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends.\"\n\nOn Instagram these days, Efron has also laid off liking everything. The last photo of Daddario's he liked was posted on May 10. Since he made headlines for his comments on Daddario's April 4 shot, Efron has only liked five Instagrams that Daddario has posted. No flirty comments recurred.\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nPeople previously reported via a source in March that Daddario and Efron were seeing each other \"on and off since their time working together on the movie last year, but they are not officially dating,\" the source said.
