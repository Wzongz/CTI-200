In African culture, they feel as if there is no king without a queen and this story, it highlights the queen, the warrior, the general, the young sister,\" said Angela Bassett, who plays T'Challa's mother Ramonda.\n\n\"I was so proud to have my daughter and my son there last night, because in their faces, in their spirit, they were feeling themselves. They stood taller after last night.\"\n\nGurira (The Walking Dead) spoke of her trepidation over having her head shaved to play Okoye, the head of Wakanda's Dora Milaje special forces, but how she saw it as \"subversive in the right way.\"\n\n\"In theory, it sounded amazing, and then the day came \u2026 It happened. Then you walk into the restroom to wash your hands, look up like, 'What the?'\n\n\"It took a few days \u2026 Then the pride started to grow, there's pride around it, and the embracing of this symbol of power and these women.\"\n\n________________\n\nRead more:\n\nThe stars coming to Middle East Film & Comic Con this year\n\nWatch: Official trailer drops for Avengers: Infinity War\n\nFrom Iron Man to Wonder Woman: The endless love affair with superhero movies\n\n________________", "images": ["https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/F7ZDTT5YCFBSVFE2M44ZVXIPI4.jpg?smart=true&auth=24ae43b41c2b3b7dc12814296f7180ff29207724c60ae22e1b77a12e9a431392&width=204&height=136", "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/Q6S6UXURC5HS7EMZTLWHZ3W3LQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=6b9a5250731b990f9360f986d9faa8c65483beb4bebe700155203d63b757193a&width=204&height=136", "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/NHXW5BG5HRBI5AICSEFJUMHRDU.jpeg?smart=true&auth=50469659ece4a0933c7504eca733fcb0585c6c473ff7cc3818306e25fa2177ae&width=204&height=136", "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DKSGHH4PF3SZU53TE2JABXO26A.jpg?smart=true&auth=82f817910206a775690d4d87397049a8913c9f8d9bc89e58925095876f64ee17&width=1200&height=630", "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/NONQZJQORVFSPEKGHXQ2JDVC3M.jpg?smart=true&auth=d5855fbb2b00278c70b9a41daf55fb7701f570351e18799c84580d5436b848ab&width=204&height=136", "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DKSGHH4PF3SZU53TE2JABXO26A.jpg?smart=true&auth=82f817910206a775690d4d87397049a8913c9f8d9bc89e58925095876f64ee17&width=800&height=576", "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/YJTKLVF6LJHADK4JD3NUQYEAHQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=bf8ed602924e09fcc5f64ded483e73366a268712180391fca6bb6048b93d9fec&width=204&height=136"], "top_img": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DKSGHH4PF3SZU53TE2JABXO26A.jpg?smart=true&auth=82f817910206a775690d4d87397049a8913c9f8d9bc89e58925095876f64ee17&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/film/chadwick-boseman-why-black-panther-needed-african-accent-1.700499", "title": "Chadwick Boseman: why 'Black Panther' needed African accent", "meta_data": {"description": "Black Panther is the first Marvel movie that features a black superhero", "twitter": {"description": "Black Panther is the first Marvel movie that features a black superhero", "title": "Chadwick Boseman: why 'Black Panther' needed African accent", "image": {"identifier": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DKSGHH4PF3SZU53TE2JABXO26A.jpg?smart=true&auth=82f817910206a775690d4d87397049a8913c9f8d9bc89e58925095876f64ee17&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "This image released by Disney and Marvel Studios' shows Chadwick Boseman in a scene from \"Black Panther,\" in theaters on Feb. 16, 2018.
