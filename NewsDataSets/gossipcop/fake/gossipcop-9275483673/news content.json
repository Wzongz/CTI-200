Is that really a possibility?\n\nEver since Gwen and Blake Shelton got together, fans have been eager for them to start a family.\n\nRumors have been flying for years, with \u201csources\u201d suggesting everything from medical miracles to secret pregnancies and beyond.\n\nThere have also been reports that the pair are headed for a split, but we choose to ignore that noise.\n\nSo, is Gwen Stefani, who turns 55 this year, pregnant? Let\u2019s discuss what we know.\n\nBlake Shelton, his wife Gwen Stefani and her children pose during his Hollywood Walk of Fame Star ceremony, in 2023. ((Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images))\n\nGwen Stefani & Blake Shelton as Parents\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton started dating in late 2015, shortly after both of them divorced their respective spouses.\n\nWhile they seemingly had nothing in common, it was clear from the start that they were perfectly aligned when it came to the importance of family.\n\nGwen gave birth to three children with her ex, Gavin Rossdale: Kingston, Zuma and Apollo.\n\nMeanwhile, Blake had no children of his own with his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. In fact, some insiders suggested that the lack of kids was the reason for their split.\n\nFrom the moment Blake joined the family, it was clear he was eager to be a role model for Gwen\u2019s boys and took to being a \u201cstepdad\u201d even before it was official.\n\nGwen Stefani pregnant in 2006 with her then husband Gavin Rossdale at the Grammys ((Photo by Stephen Shugerman/Getty Images))\n\nIs Gwen Stefani Pregnant with Blake Shelton\u2019s Child?\n\nCards on the table: no, Gwen isn\u2019t pregnant. At least, not that she has announced.\n\nBut it\u2019s not completely out of the question that these two should have a kid together \u2013 especially since they have been trying for over 7 years!\n\nGwen and Blake did not get married until 2021, but for years before that, it was reported that the pair were \u201chyper-focused on getting pregnant.\u201d\n\nInsiders close to the couple told outlets like Us Weekly that their bond was so strong, Blake and Gwen put having a kid ahead of getting married for many years.\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attend the 48th Annual AFI Life Achievement Award Honoring Julie Andrews at Dolby Theatre on June 09, 2022 in Hollywood, California.

While celebs like Janet Jackson welcomed children into their 50\u2019s, insiders explained that Gwen needed some help if she was going to conceive.\n\n\u201cGwen would love to get pregnant, things with Blake are so perfect, having a baby with him would be the icing on the cake.,\u201d a Gwen insider told HollywoodLife.com.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a big believer in alternative medicine so she wants to do it in the most natural way possible. She\u2019s been getting acupuncture and working with a Chinese herbalist to increase her fertility.\u201d\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton attend the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards at STAPLES Center on January 26, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.

That\u2019s all I wanted, my entire life\u201d\n\nThe rock star mom appeared on a 2024 episode of The Skinny Confidential Him & Her Show\u2018s podcast, and she discussed how hard it was to juggle her kids while working, even though she loved being a mom.\n\nFrom working on her solo album to touring with No Doubt, Kingston was always by her side.\n\n\u201cIt just felt so real and right. I got so ripped off on that tour because I was so sick. I ended up taking the baby when he was 9 months and going and doing a world tour, like 120 shows \u2026 We\u2019re in a hotel one day and I thought that I had to stop nursing because I was like, \u2018How am I going to nurse and be on stage?'\u201d\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attend the 2023 CMT Music Awards at Moody Center on April 02, 2023 in Austin, Texas. ( (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images))\n\nWith all that said, Gwen had thought, once upon a time, that she was too old to have another child \u2013 and then her oldest, Kingston started asking her to have another sibling.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m too old. I\u2019m not having any more babies. I\u2019m sorry, love,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cHe just wanted a baby, so he would start praying every night for this baby. Four weeks later, praying every night like, \u2018Please, let my mom have a baby,\u2019 and I\u2019m pregnant with Apollo.\u201d\n\nGwen calls that pregnancy a miracle, and she admits she\u2019s been lucky enough to have 3 miracles happen in her lifetime.\n\n\u201c[Hosting The Voice] was the second miracle. The first miracle was getting pregnant. The second was The Voice. And then the third was, obviously, meeting Blake.\u201d\n\nPerhaps a fourth miracle is due? Fourth baby, fourth miracle \u2013 stranger things have happened!", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-631611692-1-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant-3-1024x768.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0223_hannahgosselin_02_crop-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/Porsha-Williams-1-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant-5-768x1024.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='540'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0222_wendywilliams_header-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1004_rhobh_s13_05-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='768'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0223_andrewlincoln_header-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant-4-768x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1095004178-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0220_joemanganiello_caitlinoconnor_header-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/0223_princeharry_princewilliam_header-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20768'%3E%3Crect%20width='1024'%20height='768'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant-2-1024x768.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant-1-1024x768.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/0209_jingerduggar_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/Gwen-Stefani-Pregnant.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Simon Delott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2024/02/gwen-stefani-pregnant/", "title": "Gwen Stefani Pregnant: Is 'Miracle' Baby #4 With Blake Shelton Happening?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani Pregnant: Is 'Miracle' Baby #4 With Blake Shelton Happening?", "description": "Is Gwen Stefani pregnant?
