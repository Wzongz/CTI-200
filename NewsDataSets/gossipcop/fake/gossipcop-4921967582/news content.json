Simply put, there are just too many obstacles for the Oscar winner and the country superstar to overcome. During the course of their union, the two 50-year-old Australia natives have struggled to deal with Keith\u2019s addiction issues \u2014 he went to rehab four months after they wed in 2006 \u2014 as well as Nicole\u2019s anger over rumors of his infidelity.\n\nThe couple, who share daughters Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7, \u201chave been fighting constantly over Nicole\u2019s incessant jealousy and need to control Keith on every level,\u201d added the insider. \u201cThey have been putting a Band-Aid over their problems for too long. While they have smiles plastered on their faces in public, in private, things have been falling apart.\u201d\n\nThe counseling trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. \u201cIt was Keith\u2019s idea to visit the boot camp,\u201d the insider said. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. \u201cHe gave her an ultimatum,\u201d the source said. And she knew he wasn\u2019t bluffing. The insider said their recent fights have gotten so bad that Keith has even left their Nashville home to stay overnight at a hotel. \u201cIt\u2019s become a second home for him. Of course, there have been times she\u2019s given up and walked out on him, too,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nBut in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. \u201cThey addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,\u201d the insider explained.\n\nThey both opened up. \u201cKeith said he couldn\u2019t continue to live in a marriage where he felt like he was being constantly monitored like one of her children,\u201d the source shared. \u201cAnd Nicole ended up breaking down and spilled her heart out about how past relationships had damaged her, and she vowed to make a conscious effort to change things.\u201d The nearly weeklong retreat was intense. Said the insider, \u201cAt one point it was touch-and-go whether they\u2019d even leave together.\u201d They ultimately did, and yet it didn\u2019t work \u2014 their problems still remain.\n\nNicole and Keith struggled from the outset of their union. When the \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color\u201d singer moved to Nashville from Australia in the \u201990s, drugs \u201cwere my thing,\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 2016. \u201cI loved them.\u201d By the time he met Nicole in 2005, he was seven years sober following a rehab stay in 1998. But he relapsed shortly after their 2006 wedding and checked into Betty Ford. Nicole was devastated. \u201cIt was very, very hard to have to have her go through that,\u201d Keith later said.\n\nNicole publicly stood by his side (and even hopped on a flight from Europe to be with him when she heard the news), but it was a struggle. \u201cIt was just another twist in my life: Here it goes. Hold on, and off we go! But it was painful, deeply painful,\u201d she admitted to Vanity Fair in 2007. \u201cWe were in a very, very, very bad, painful place, and have managed to step through it.\u201d\n\nOther problems soon replaced that one. In 2015, Keith was photographed hanging out with his opening act, fellow country singer Kelsea Ballerini, 24, on his tour bus. The photos left Nicole furious. \u201cShe calls him out every time he\u2019s pictured with another woman,\u201d according to a friend. \u201cKeith is constantly defending himself from rumors of on-tour affairs with groupies and female singers.\u201d\n\nNicole \u2014 who attended this year\u2019s Oscars alone because Keith had a concert \u2014 has even admitted to keeping close tabs on him when they are apart. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when my husband doesn\u2019t answer his phone. I have to keep calling and calling, and I get anxious. Does that make me high-maintenance?\u201d she told W Magazine in 2017. Around the same time, Keith became the jealous one. A source said he became furious when he learned that Nicole pushed to get Zoe\u0308 Kravitz \u2014 the daughter of Nicole\u2019s ex-fiance\u0301 Lenny Kravitz \u2014 hired on her HBO series Big Little Lies. \u201cKeith feared she may still have feelings for Lenny,\u201d said the source. \u201cNicole kept telling Keith that Zoe\u0308 is like family and it was a mutual decision between the producers that she was right for the part. Lenny had nothing to do with it, but Keith didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nStory continues after video\n\nLoading the player...\n\nThey have also clashed over where to live. \u201cNicole likes the more laid-back life in Australia, and she thinks it would be a great place for the girls,\u201d said the friend. Keith, however, prefers his adopted home of Nashville. The four-time Grammy winner \u201chas become one of contemporary country music\u2019s biggest stars, and he\u2019s looked upon as one of the kings of the city,\u201d continued the friend. \u201cHe feels he has to stay in Music City to stay relevant and on top of his game. The discussion over living in Australia versus living in Nashville has become a contentious battle.\u201d\n\nThe couple already seem to be liquidating assets to make a divorce easier. They recently listed one of their homes \u2014 and there will be plenty more to fight over in the event of an ugly breakup. The pair also own a Beverly Hills home, which they bought for $3.47 million in 2008, and an apartment in NYC\u2019s trendy Chelsea neighborhood and they have spent $18 million on properties in Australia. Combined, they are worth an estimated $350 million. (There could be a battle over the kids, as well.)\n\nThe public may be shocked when Keith and Nicole inevitably announce a decision to separate.\n\nBut insiders know better.\n\nSaid the friend, \u201cTheir marriage is in far bigger trouble than they\u2019re letting on.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published on our sister site Closer Magazine.", "images": ["https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/03/mardi-gras-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/NTL-Hero-2024-02-24T104819.677-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/35_Mag-Cover-Image-1.png", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2018/03/26/45990/Nicole-ART.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/03/26/1522007131738_nicole-kidman-keith-urban-blast.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/womensday_adobe_express-01.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Vector.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/03/26/1522006882566_AAutKrh.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/WomansDay/2013/11/14/12041/nic_0210.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/tvweek_adobe_express-01.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/WomansDay/2013/11/13/8767/nicole_2908.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2018/03/26/1522007103736_keith-urban-nicole-kidman-family.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/PTL-logo-3.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/NTL-Hero-2024-02-23T145515.663-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/t5_adobe_express.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2018/03/26/45990/Nicole-ART.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Closer Staff"], "canonical_link": "http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-divorce-156494", "title": "Are Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban headed for divorce?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The public may be shocked when Keith and Nicole inevitably announce a decision to separate.
