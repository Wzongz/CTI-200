Spence holds the WBA, WBV and IBF Welterweight titles, while Crawford is the holder of the WBO title. Each fighter is ranked in the top five of most recognised publisher\u2019s pound for pound rankings, with Crawford being ranked number one with ESPN and BWAA.\n\nCrawford, 34, is a three-weight world champion having also won world titles at lightweight and light welterweight and boasts a 38-0 professional record since making his debut in March 2008.\n\nAs for Spence, he is two years Crawford\u2019s junior and also remains unbeaten at this stage of his career. The 32-year-old is 28-0 but has fought just twice since suffering a serious car accident in October 2019 and also saw a meeting with Manny Pacquiao cancelled due to an eye injury.\n\nTwo world class fighters in their own right, there is no doubt that this fight is long overdue and it will be a legacy defining one for whoever comes out on top. Spence\u2019s record is the more impressive of the two, although Crawford is given the edge by many when it comes to ability.\n\nMost boxing betting sites concur, too. One is SportsBetting.ag, who have released odds for the preliminary bout that is expected to take place in Las Vegas. You can find our SportsBetting.ag review here.\n\nThey have priced Crawford as the early favorite to win the fight by the narrowest of margins. He is a -120 shot to win the fight outright, while Spence comes in close at -110. The odds of both highlight how this truly is a 50-50 fight and one that will capture the imagination of boxing fans across the globe.\n\nMany combat sports fans have turned to the UFC in recent years due to the lack of politics associated with the promotional company. The best regularly fight the best and fans are able to witness mega fights on a far more regular basis than in boxing.\n\nThat is also what makes this fight all the more tantalising for boxing fans. Undisputed bouts are rare in the modern era and the meeting of two pound for pound fighters for all of the belts in the division is an even more special occasion.\n\nTerence Crawford vs Errol Spence Jr Odds", "images": ["http://yournewswire.com/wp-content/themes/joints-wp-master/assets/images/blank.gif", "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/07/Crawford.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/07/Crawford.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://yournewswire.com/terence-crawford-vs-errol-spence-jr-odds-sportsbetting-ag-gives-edge-to-crawford", "title": "Terence Crawford vs Errol Spence Jr Odds: SportsBetting.ag Gives Edge To Crawford", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimal-ui", "description": "There is arguably no more anticipated fight in the world of boxing than the meeting between pound-for-pound American greats Terence Crawford and Errol Spence", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Terence Crawford vs Errol Spence Jr Odds: SportsBetting.ag Gives Edge To Crawford - yournewswire", "description": "There is arguably no more anticipated fight in the world of boxing than the meeting between pound-for-pound American greats Terence Crawford and Errol Spence", "url": "https://yournewswire.com/terence-crawford-vs-errol-spence-jr-odds-sportsbetting-ag-gives-edge-to-crawford", "site_name": "yournewswire", "updated_time": "2022-07-20T13:18:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/07/Crawford.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/07/Crawford.jpeg", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "alt": "Terence Crawford vs Errol Spence", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"section": "General News", "published_time": "2022-07-20T13:11:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-07-20T13:18:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Terence Crawford vs Errol Spence Jr Odds: SportsBetting.ag Gives Edge To Crawford - yournewswire", "description": "There is arguably no more anticipated fight in the world of boxing than the meeting between pound-for-pound American greats Terence Crawford and Errol Spence", "image": "https://yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/07/Crawford.jpeg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Dean Carr", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "2 minutes"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1658322719.0, "source": "http://yournewswire.com", "summary": ""}
