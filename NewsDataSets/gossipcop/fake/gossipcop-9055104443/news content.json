That\u2019s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn\u2019t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.\u201d\n\nEach believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn\u2019t have worked. \u201cWe had to grow and discover ourselves first,\u201d she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, \u201cThey weren\u2019t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.\u201d\n\nThe next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy\u2014with a sense of humor\u2014to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance.\u201d She\u2019s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, \u201cthere is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA-Rod\u2019s in the house,\u201d someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he\u2019s seen the show many times, he\u2019s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to \u201cJenny from the Block.\u201d Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez\u2019s feet. During a segment that\u2019s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. \u201cIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see what number she\u2019s wearing on her jersey,\u201d he says. It\u2019s 13, his Yankee number.\n\nHe says, \u201cWe are very much twins.\u201d She says, \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could.\u201d\n\nEarlier that day, she and Rodriguez were in Los Angeles at the premiere event for this season\u2019s Shark Tank, in which Rodriguez will be the first Latino shark. At a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says, \u201cA lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when Alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.\u201d\n\nDuring the red-carpet interviews, Lopez, who is impossibly glamorous in a floor-length tweed coat and aviator sunglasses, hangs at the back of the crowd. \u201cDoes it feel weird to be in the background?\u201d I ask. \u201cNoooo,\u201d she says. \u201cI like it. Because I\u2019m out there enough. Some people, it wouldn\u2019t work\u2014they can\u2019t stand not being the one in the spotlight. But not us.\u201d\n\nBack in Business\n\nTheir story is also a merger of business empires. Lopez, who back in 2002\u2014way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneur\u2014launched her fragrance Glow by J.Lo, now has a big portfolio of business interests, which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings. Rodriguez seems to slot right into her world.\n\nFrom a young age, he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income. During his suspension year, he took investing classes at Columbia and marketing classes at the University of Miami. Today, A-Rod Corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries, including real estate, sports and wellness, media, and entertainment. \u201cI don\u2019t have your traditional formal education,\u201d he says. \u201cMine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors. I\u2019ve never been afraid to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. Can you explain that to me?\u2019", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f36396ddf784604d17e8eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e5225b7a40d71fd1688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-small-white.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639525b7a40d71fd1638/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65cba610eeb7ea09827998e1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5847108b9dee4a361369e3fe/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65ce3fef07051aff40b2d090/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65cb938bc1a4420099458b1e/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65cd0b12aed7b6ec64d8f3ac/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f363955ba52f25246815cd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639616ff751cf425ef2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss05.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Bethany Mclean", "Mario Testino", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-cover-story", "title": "J-Rod!
