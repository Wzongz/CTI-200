Salmon and oysters are on the menu, while red meat is off.\n\nBoth Harry and Meghan adore kids and can\u2019t wait to have their own together.\n\nMelanie also advised Meghan to avoid trans fats \u2013 found in chips, cakes and popcorn \u2013 as they affect insulin levels, which in turn affects ovulation.\n\nThe couple must also cut caffeine out of their diet entirely.\n\nIn addition, Meghan must have two portions of full- fat dairy per day.\n\nFor the full story on their exciting baby dreams, get the new issue of Woman\u2019s Day \u2013 on sale now!", "images": ["https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/03/mardi-gras-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/12/15/1513305281793_SOCIAL.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/35_Mag-Cover-Image-1.png", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/FavIcon-150x150.png", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2019/05/07/39042/PRINCE-HARRY-WITH-KIDS.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/NTL-Hero-2024-02-24T104819.677-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/womensday_adobe_express-01.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Vector.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/tvweek_adobe_express-01.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/12/14/43611/MAIN-(1).jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/12/15/1513306435040_FBCMS.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/12/15/43671/MAIN.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/PTL-logo-3.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/NTL-Hero-2024-02-23T145515.663-720x405.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/12/15/1513305228108_PRINCE-HARRY-6.jpg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/t5_adobe_express.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/12/15/1513306435040_FBCMS.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Now To Love"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/royals/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-new-year-baby-plans-43672/", "title": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s new year baby plans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "It\u2019s not just the wedding Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are busy planning, we can reveal they've been meeting with fertility specialist Melanie Brown.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s new-year baby plans revealed!", "description": "It's not just the May wedding the couple are busy planning...", "url": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/royals/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-new-year-baby-plans-43672/", "site_name": "Now To Love", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/12/15/1513306435040_FBCMS.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-17T20:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-02-04T23:35:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "2 minutes", "label2": "Written by", "data2": "Now to Love"}, "sailthru.date": "2017-12-17 20:00:00", "sailthru.title": "Meghan Markle & Prince Harry\u2019s new-year baby plans revealed: meet their fertility doctor", "sailthru.author": "Now to Love", "sailthru.description": "<p>It\u2019s not just the May wedding the couple are busy planning\u2026</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/12/15/43672/MAIN.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/12/15/43672/MAIN.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/cropped-FavIcon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513540800.0, "source": "http://www.nowtolove.com.au", "summary": ""}
