Mueller is suing Swift because he was fired from his radio co-host job in 2013 after she claimed he lifted her skirt and grabbed her butt while they posed for a photo at a meet and greet during her Denver Red Tour concert. Swift filed a countersuit a month later for sexual assault and battery.\n\nAccording to Gossip Cop and the Associated Press, Mueller is seeking $3 million in damages from Swift, while Swift is seeking just $1 in her suit (in addition to reimbursement for attorneys fees and costs in defending the suit, according to pre-trial documents per The Denver Post). \"She's not trying to bankrupt this man,\" her attorney J. Doug Baldridge said in his opening statement yesterday (via Denver ABC 7's live case blog). \"She's just trying to tell people out there that you can say no when someone puts their hand on you. Grabbing a woman's rear end is an assault, and it's always wrong. Any woman\u2014rich, poor, famous, or not\u2014is entitled to have that not happen.\"\n\nGossip Cop also reported that if Swift is awarded any additional damages, she said she will donate the money to a women's rights charity.\n\nThe Mueller v. Swift trial\u2014which is before a judge and 8-member jury (6 women, 2 men selected)\u2014is expected to last for nine days total. Swift is expected to testify.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2036427271-65da8dd38368d.jpg?crop=0.423xw:0.282xh;0.160xw,0.0748xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/irina-shayk-and-bradley-cooper-attend-heavenly-bodies-news-photo-955835872-1551021536.jpg?crop=0.645xw:0.516xh;0.156xw,0.0204xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/saved.ad81f1a.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-gettyimages-1957560346-65da90aad8f68.jpg?crop=0.420xw:0.840xh;0.0224xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x640/landscape-1444320723-taylor-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leonardo-vittoria-64fe083b391d4.jpeg?crop=0.500xw:0.945xh;0.500xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x640/landscape-1444320723-taylor-index.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kanye-west-bianca-censori-gettyimages-1673626199.jpg?crop=0.487xw:0.974xh;0.513xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-aniston-attends-the-30th-annual-screen-actors-news-photo-1708821785.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anne-hathaway-attends-the-versace-fashion-show-during-the-news-photo-1708801363.jpg?crop=0.905xw:0.604xh;0.0689xw,0.0684xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/tiktok.603c377.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bradley-cooper-during-the-2023-gotham-awards-at-cipriani-news-photo-1701384618.jpg?crop=0.814xw:0.543xh;0.0721xw,0.0139xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-attend-a-basketball-game-news-photo-1704387273.jpg?crop=0.666xw:1.00xh;0.0293xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-gettyimages-2028792270-65da8ae97d8a2.jpg?crop=0.646xw:1.00xh;0.231xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.242fea1.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-blunt-meryl-streep-and-anne-hathaway-speak-onstage-news-photo-1708823756.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.138xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/close.38e3324.svg?primary=black", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-burn-ballads-babyface-ak-v1-65283d375ffe8.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2028793082-65da949ab2ec9.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.196xw,0&resize=360:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1280x640/landscape-1444320723-taylor-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a47246/taylor-swift-is-countersuing-for-1-in-mueller-trial/", "title": "Taylor Swift Is Countersuing for Just $1 in Her Sexual Assault Trial", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Taylor Swift Seeking Just $1 in Sexual Assault Trial -
