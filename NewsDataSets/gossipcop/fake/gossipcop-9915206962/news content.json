The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple\u2019s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.\n\nShelton made the joke about his girlfriend \u2013 who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale \u2013 while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.\n\nA video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet \u201cGo Ahead And Break My Heart\u201d as they both stopped by Shelton\u2019s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.\n\nAfter Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting \u201cGwen! Gwen! Gwen!\u201d as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.\n\nThat\u2019s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all \u201clucky\u201d to have her perform because she\u2019d only just given birth to their twins the day before.\n\n\u201cYou guys are very lucky that [she\u2019s here],\u201d Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.\n\n\u201cShe actually gave birth to twins yesterday,\u201d the country star then joked of how they\u2019re hounded by pregnancy rumors, \u201cand she\u2019s here tonight to sing with me.\u201d\n\nGwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC\u2019s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.\n\nThe twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.\n\nShelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.\n\nOf course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.\n\nThough it appeared that they were separated for Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 likely due to Shelton\u2019s busy touring schedule \u2013 Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.\n\nGwen \u2013 who\u2019s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo \u2013 shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.\n\nStefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine\u2019s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day. I love you!
