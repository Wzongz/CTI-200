That\u2019s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much 'Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock' \u2014 I am so not that.\"\n\nOnce swift, angry blowback followed the publication of the piece, Cyrus took to Instagram to share her side of the story, or her account of what didn't make it into print: She stressed that the comment was made in a broader conversation and that she's an \"artist without borders\" who was asked about her thoughts on rap for this particular conversation.\n\n\"A lot of the time publications like to focus on the most sensationalized part of the conversation,\" she writes. \"So, to be clear I respect ALL artists who speak their truth and appreciate ALL genres of music (country, pop, alternative .... but in this particular interview I was asked about rap) I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop as I've collaborated with some of the very best! At this point in my life I am expanding personally/musically and gravitating more towards uplifting, conscious rap!\"", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:a3733720-cfd0-4ef8-b781-b3304fc265fa?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:6a66ac86-8851-4ed7-b3b8-e56b9e00d4bd?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c4671e15-8a67-467d-b290-0fa59d0cfb6f?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:5eb6be4e-df0a-4ac6-8ed7-1c95e9d81f99?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=webp&height=270&width=480&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:a72d7adf-7d23-4258-86bc-f2c6e35e7b60?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:9eee31f9-8704-47a4-b710-34f792869e09?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:5667b1be-6c77-457e-9fc1-76e2a5ab8899?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:b8f5c20b-9a52-4e48-9f77-f4910ab2dc04?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:b463afea-6b67-45d0-95fb-e494baf54619?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mtv.com/news/zscdkq/miley-cyrus-rap-comments", "title": "Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments", "meta_data": {"app_version": "7a89c49a1229cdb182d57738c979eabb790fab89-6302-2024-02-23", "robots": "noydir,noodp, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "description": "Miley Cyrus responds to criticism for her rap comments in her 'Billboard' cover story: 'to be clear I respect ALL artists who speak their truth and appreciate ALL genres of music.'", "original-source": "https://www.mtv.com/news/zscdkq/miley-cyrus-rap-comments", "search": {"title": "Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments", "description": "'I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop'", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn", "imageHeight": 574, "imageWidth": 1020, "url": "/news/zscdkq/miley-cyrus-rap-comments", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-05-06T21:14:18.000Z"}, "og": {"site_name": "MTV", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "title": "Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments", "description": "'I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop'", "url": "https://www.mtv.com/news/zscdkq/miley-cyrus-rap-comments", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop'", "title": "Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:3cdef211-7973-46c0-8828-076bea8e6db5?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.com", "summary": ""}
