    "explain": "CryptoCore is an attack campaign against crypto-exchange companies that has been ongoing for three years and was discovered by ClearSky researchers. This cybercrime campaign is focused mainly on the theft of cryptocurrency wallets, and we estimate that the attackers have already made off with hundreds of millions of dollars. This campaign was also reported by additional companies and organizations, including JPCERT/CC1 , NTT Security2 and F-SECURE3 . The campaign is also known as CryptoMimic, Dangerous Password and Leery Turtle. In our report we attributed this campaign to a specific actor – North Korea’s LAZARUS APT Group. This attribution is a result of two stages of research.Our research shows a MEDIUM-HIGH likelihood that Lazarus group, a North-Korean, state-sponsored APT group, is attacking crypto exchanges all over the world and in Israel for at least three years. This group is has successfully hacked into numerous companies and organizations around the world for many years. Until recently this group was not known to attack Israeli targets.We would like to thank NTT Security Japan for sharing malware samples with us, and for their feedback on this research.LAZARUS AKA APT38, Hidden Cobra, Whois Team, ZINC and others is a North Korean APT group active since at least 2009. The group’s focus is mainly espionage, political attacks (anti-US and anti-South Korea, mostly) and financial, especially cryptocurrency wallets attack. According to the FBI this group is state-sponsored and is a part of North Korea’s RGB intelligence agency.On June 2020, we released a detailed report about a three-year-old campaign targeting crypto-exchanges in Israel, US, Europe, and Japan by unknown group which we dubbed CryproCore4 campaign. We also identified that the attackers behind this campaign stole millions of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency wallets. While at the time, we did not attribute this campaign, our initial hypothesis was that this group is of Russian or other eastern-European origin. Parallel to our report, other cybersecurity firms released research papers describing similar attacks.By comparing these papers with what we know of the CryptoCore campaign, we found it possible that they are all referring to the same campaign, with each of the reports touching on parts of a large-scale attack. In this research paper we tried to connect the dots from all issued reports to full picture, and also attempted to support and expand F-SECURE’s attribution of this campaign to LAZARUS.The purpose of this research is the attribution of the CryptoCore campaign to a specific APT actor - LAZARUS. We did this in two steps: First step – We compared ClearSky’s CryptoCore’s research with three other research papers to find enough similarities to confidently say they are all referring to the same campaign:Second step – Having shown that the four research papers all refer to the same attack campaign, we accepted F-SECURE’s attribution of this campaign to LAZARUS by doing these corroborating tests: We started by comparing ClearSky’s CryptoCore research paper to two additional papers by F-SECURE and JPCERT/CC which seem to point to the same attack campaign and APT group. By comparing these research papers, we found that they share: Our working hypothesis is that since all three papers share many varied IoCs (domains, IPs, Files etc.) as well as the same VBS script, then they all point to the same attack campaign.The following 40 IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and F-SECURE papers.The following six IOC’s were all found in both the ClearSky and JPCERT/CC papers.As part of ClearSky’s CryptoCore research, we uncovered a VBS script used for connecting the attacked system with C&C servers and awaiting instructions. A nearly identical script was presented as part of F-SECURE’s research. Here are the two scripts, un-obfuscated, side by side.A reference is made in JPCERT/CC’s report to a very similar script, which operates in the same fashion and has the same parameters.Given the large amount of similar IOC’s and a virtually identical VBS script all found in ClearSky’s, F-SECURE’s and JPCERT/CC’s research papers, we can assume it is highly probable they are all referring to the same attack campaign.Another research paper we found to be related to the same attack campaign is by NTT SECURITY. To clearly say they are related, we searched for similarities between the RAT and STEALER tools found in NTT SECURITY’s and F-SECURE’s research papers. Our working hypothesis is that if the different malwares display many similarities, then NTT SECURITY’s research can also be said to relate to the same attack campaign. The above all show that the RAT found in NTT SECURITY’s research (msoRAT) was also used for the attacks in F-SECURE’s research. Another test we performed in whether YARA rules written by F-SECURE for the RAT and STEALER they identified in their research would apply to the RAT and STEALER identified by NTT SECURITY.Our test found that the answer to that is yes – F-SECURE’s rules did sign the tools found in NTT SECURITY’s research. This strengthens the hypothesis that these tools were created by the same actors.We can say with a high probability that NTT SECURITY’s research also deals with the same attack campaign and attacker as the other three research papers. This means that all four research papers are about the same attack campaign. After showing that all four research papers point to the same attack campaign, we attempted to reaffirm the hypothesis in F-SECURE’s paper attributing the campaign to LAZARUS. We did this by applying YARA rules for the RAT identified in F-SECURE’s report to a different RAT named “NukeSpeed” found in ESET’s report and verified as belonging to LAZARUS (SHA256 8b6887c5ec6fadaefee78f089e9a347a539bcedf52f5827f866a49a1839f8c4b).As we can see, the RC4 algorithm unique to LAZARUS and the backdoor for the RAT from F-SECURE’s research were both found in the RAT from ESET’s research. It is worth noting that in Fsecure’s report they reference a RAT from an older LAZARUS report from 2016, conducted by KASPERSKY (bbd703f0d6b1cad4ff8f3d2ee3cc073c). Attempting to apply F-SECURE’s backdoor YARA rule to the findings from this report will not work, but only because the 2016 backdoor accesses a file named “scaeve.dat” while in newer versions that has been changed to “perflog.dat”. Changing the file’s name would cause the YARA rule to apply to the 2016 research as well.We can see that our test for applying YARA rules from F-SECURE’s research to ESET’s and KASPERSKY’s research worked, and highly strengthens the attribution of these attacks to LAZARUS. During our research, we located several indicative and uncommon traits for LAZARUS tools that were part of the attack campaign: Similar traits for RAT.By being able to sign F-SECURE’s YARA rules to RATs associated with LAZARUS from ESET and KASPERSKY’s we have greatly strengthened F-SECURE’s attribution of the CryptoCore attack campaign to LAZARUS. In addition, we have located several indicative and uncommon traits in these tools all associated with LAZARUS. The above information means we can, with a high level of probability, attribute the CryptoCore attack campaign to LAZARUS.\n\n\n",
