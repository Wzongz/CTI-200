    "explain": "New findings about a hacker group called ‘Bad Magic,’ which is linked to cyber attacks targeting companies in the Russia-Ukrainian conflict area, reveal that it may have been around for much longer than previously thought, according to leading cyber security firm Kaspersky.“In March 2023, we uncovered a previously unknown APT campaign in the region of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict that involved the use of PowerMagic and CommonMagic implants. However, at the time it was not clear which threat actor was behind the attack.“Since the release of our report about CommonMagic, we have been looking for additional clues that would allow us to learn more about this actor. As we expected, we have been able to gain a deeper insight into the Bad Magic story,” says Kaspersky. “While looking for implants bearing similarities with PowerMagic and CommonMagic, we identified a cluster of even more sophisticated malicious activities originating from the same threat actor.“What was most interesting about it is that its victims were located not only in the Donetsk, Lugansk and Crimea regions, but also in central and western Ukraine. Targets included individuals, as well as diplomatic and research organisations.”The campaign is characterised by the use of a novel modular framework codenamed CloudWizard, which features capabilities to take screenshots, record microphone, log keystrokes, grab passwords, and harvest Gmail inboxes.Bad Magic was first report in March 2023, detailing the group's use of a backdoor called PowerMagic (aka DBoxShell or GraphShell) and a modular framework dubbed CommonMagic in attacks targeting Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\n\n",

            "content": "At the beginning of 2018, researchers discovered that the Patchwork APT group was also operating spear phishing campaigns targeting think tank groups from the US. In recent attacks, the Patchwork group has been using a payload that is a modified or custom-built RAT instead of using readily available remote admin tools. The Patchwork APT group has expanded its wings with enhanced malware toolsets and has been targeting China and other regions through spear phishing attacks. The image below showcases Chinese and Pakistani fighter war games with a CVE\u00022019-0808 exploit code that drops and executes Patchwork APT payloads on victim machines. This group is suspected to be run by an Indian-speaking threat actor targeting foreign embassies and diplomatic offices in Pakistan, Sri-Lanka, Uruguay, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Australia, and the USA. We suspect that the attack is executed in the form of spear phishing emails with malicious attachments.",
