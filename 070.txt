  "explain": "Researchers have published new information about a malicious campaign targeting government agencies, military organizations and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland. From at least April 2022 until this month, hackers attempted to infiltrate victims' devices to steal information and gain permanent remote access, according to a new report released by cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos. The researchers did not disclose the extent of the impact of the attacks. Cisco Talos noted that Ukraine's computer emergency response team (CERT-UA) recently attributed the July incidents to the hacker group UNC1151, also known as GhostWriter, which has been linked to the Belarusian government. CERT-UA’s report did not include information about attacks before July. GhostWriter has targeted Ukrainian military personnel and Poland's government services before. The group mostly carries out phishing operations that steal email login credentials, compromise websites and distribute malware. In the campaign tracked by Cisco Talos, hackers used a multistage infection chain to get into their targets’ systems. First, they sent malicious Microsoft Office email attachments, mostly using Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint file formats, the researchers said These files imitated documents that appear to be sent from Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, Poland's Ministry of National Defense, and the State Treasury Service of Ukraine, among others. For instance, some of the Excel documents resemble forms used to calculate salary payments for soldiers of a specific military unit. Ukrainian and Polish businesses and general users were targeted by malicious Excel spreadsheets that masqueraded as value-added tax (VAT) return forms. The PowerPoint files would not show any actual slides when opened, but would still execute the malicious code. Researchers suggest that hackers' use of PowerPoint files indicates that they were experimenting with file formats that are less commonly used in attacks. The next stage of the attack was the deployment of downloader malware called PicassoLoader, which launches the final payloads, including the AgentTesla remote access trojan (RAT), Cobalt Strike beacons and another trojan known as njRAT. These payloads are used for information theft and remote access to infected systems, the researchers said.\n\n\n",

Gamaredon's most popular targets include government organizations, critical infrastructure facilities, and Ukraine’s defense, security, and law enforcement agencies. In its recent campaigns against Ukraine, Gamaredon used variants of PowerShell info-stealer malware known as GammaLoad and GammaSteel. The Russian-sponsored hacker group known as Gamaredon continues to attack Ukrainian organizations and remains one of the “key cyber threats” for Ukraine’s cyberspace, according to a report the Ukrainian government published Wednesday. Ukraine claims that Gamaredon operates from the city of Sevastopol in Russia-occupied Crimea, but acts on orders from the FSB Center for Information Security in Moscow.

Chances about even that Gamaredon group choose this infrastructure on Russian soil to avoid being defaced by law enforcement or disruption of their offensive operations by VPS service provider. For that purpose, the capabilities of the existing cyber units have been strengthened and threat actors like Gamaredon are actively involved in organizing and conducting cyberattacks. Multiple overlaps between these incidents and previous attacks of the Gamaredon APT group (4), such as command and control infrastructures and adversary techniques, helped analysts to highly likely attribute these latest attacks to the Gamaredon group. Palo Alto Networks linked the activity cluster to Gamaredon - a threat actor that the Ukrainian government attributed to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). The latest military supports from western NATO allies to the Ukrainian army, like the confirmation of the sending Patriot missile system and calls from Latvia on Germany to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine (1), highly likely have increased the will to carry out the cyberattacks done by Russian state-sponsored APT group Gamaredon.",
