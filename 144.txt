  "explain": "TA551 was the most prevalent threat Red Canary encountered in 2020 by a wide margin. Its pervasiveness was revealed not only in the volume of detections, but in the number of organizations affected across multiple industries and company sizes. The preeminence of TA551 is due in part to our depth of detection coverage for it: throughout 2020, 55 distinct detection analytics triggered on activity that we’ve associated with TA551. TA551 also took the top spot due to our ability to detect it in the earliest stages of initial access through patterns in malicious attachments. Approximately two-thirds of TA551 detections we observed didn’t progress beyond opening the malicious attachment. To understand how an organization can be part of the two-thirds that didn’t get infected with the next stage of malware, let’s take a look at the progression of a TA551 attack.TA551 gains initial access via macro-laden Microsoft Word documents delivered within a password-protected ZIP archive attached to a phishing email. Wrapping malicious attachments within password-protected archives enables these messages to bypass many mail protection filters by preventing direct analysis of the malicious files. This technique has become more common in recent years, as it increases the likelihood that the phishing message will make it to a user’s inbox. While TA551 varies the filenames for these ZIP archives, including targeted names tailored to the recipient’s organization, in many cases the name was either request.zip or info.zip.After opening the archive using a password provided within the email body, the recipient is presented with a Word document containing malicious macros. This is the dropper, designed to download additional malware from an adversary-controlled site. This is a crucial point for organizations with a defense-in-depth strategy; many of our TA551 detections progressed no further than the opening of this malicious document. Why? Because organizations that have implemented a restrictive macro policy disrupt this attack by preventing the execution of malicious code. Such a policy is the primary distinction between the two-thirds of detections that stopped here and the one-third that progressed to the more impactful stages of the attack.For a variety of reasons, many organizations and users do allow macros to run. In these cases, the macro will result in a network connection to attempt to download the next stage of the malware. Herein lies another example of a defense-in-depth strategy that may disrupt the attack: a web proxy that inspects network traffic may block access to the domain hosting the malicious payload. In some cases, we observed a network connection and creation of an empty file as a result of the attempted download, but because the malicious content was prevented from being downloaded, the attack chain ended there.If a macro policy doesn’t prevent the code from running and a web proxy doesn’t prevent the next payload from being downloaded, a new malware family will likely execute. TA551 typically transitions from the initial access phase to malware execution via a DLL installer. There have been several variations in how the DLL installer payload was downloaded (see T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer). In some cases, Microsoft Word downloaded the file directly. Other cases leveraged renamed system utilities certutil.exe or mshta.exe to further distance the payload from the dropper. The downloaded DLL file typically masqueraded as well, using a variety of different non-DLL extensions to attempt to blend in—we’ve seen .dat, .jpg, .pdf, .txt, and even .theme file extensions. Despite these attempts to masquerade (and sometimes because of them), our detection analytics repeatedly triggered when the payload was executed. For most of 2020, this execution was done via regsvr32.exe; however, near the end of the year this was replaced with the use of rundll32.exe. While far from the only threat to use these T1218: Signed Binary Proxy Execution sub-techniques, it is no coincidence that T1218 was the second-most prevalent technique we observed in 2020.Once the DLL installer runs, the next stage of malware begins. TA551 has delivered various payloads over the years: In 2019 and early 2020, Ursnif and Zloader were common payloads In mid-2020, TA551 favored delivering Valak as a first-stage and IcedId as a second-stage payload for a few months By mid-July 2020, TA551 stopped using Valak and exclusively delivered IcedID (our fourth most prevalent threat) as its first-stage payload through the end of the year In January 2021, after a brief holiday hiatus, TA551 campaigns returned with a new notable payload: Qbot (our third most prevalent threat) Our understanding of this threat is still evolving, as is the relationship between TA551’s initial access and the post-exploitation goals of the later-stage malware.
