    "claim": "A newly identified cyber-espionage campaign, codenamed 'Shadow Lynx', has been actively targeting European Union diplomatic entities with sophisticated phishing attacks since mid-2020, leveraging compromised non-governmental organization (NGO) emails to distribute a novel malware, 'DiplomatRAT'.",

    "explain": "The 'Shadow Lynx' cyber-espionage campaign has emerged as a significant threat to the security of the European Union's diplomatic communications. Starting in mid-2020, this campaign has utilized compromised email accounts from various NGOs as a springboard for conducting targeted phishing attacks against EU diplomatic entities. The attackers deploy a previously unknown malware, dubbed 'DiplomatRAT', which is specifically designed to infiltrate, monitor, and extract sensitive information from the compromised systems. 'DiplomatRAT' showcases advanced evasion techniques, including the use of legitimate network protocols for data exfiltration to avoid detection by traditional cybersecurity measures. The campaign's focus on EU diplomatic entities suggests a motive of gathering intelligence on EU foreign policy and internal diplomatic discussions. While the exact origins of 'Shadow Lynx' remain unclear, the sophisticated nature of the attacks and the high-value targets involved indicate that this could be a state-sponsored operation. Cybersecurity researchers are actively analyzing 'DiplomatRAT' to understand its full capabilities and develop countermeasures to protect vulnerable networks from this emerging threat.",
