It has been discovered that a hacker group dubbed Chimera has been targeting numerous semiconductor vendors in Taiwan using a skeleton key injector technique to steal intellectual property.Skeleton APT, operational since 2018, recently targeted at least seven semiconductor manufacturers located at the Hsinchu Science Industrial Park in Taiwan in a well-coordinated attack.While using a plethora of custom-built malicious tools, the group also used several additional tactics during its espionage campaigns.Skeleton key attacks could allow attackers to log into a targeted system without the need for valid credentials. The threat actors could remain hidden for a long time since their targeted machines (AD and DC Servers) are not rebooted frequently. To avoid such incidents, users of Azure or other cloud environments must use multi-factor authentication.
