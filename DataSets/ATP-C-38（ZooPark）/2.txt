Sometimes even a completely innocent-looking site with a good reputation can be harmful — criminals may find and exploit a vulnerability. For example, they can use the site for drive-by attacks, causing each visitor to download a file automatically (and unwittingly) as soon as they get to the site. For example, Android users interested in current events in the Middle East are at risk of getting a whole menagerie — ZooPark spyware — on their phones. Kaspersky Lab has been following this malware since 2015, and it has learned a plethora of new tricks since then. The current, fourth version of this Trojan can steal almost any information from your smartphone, from contacts to call logs and info you enter by keyboard. Here is the list of data that ZooPark can collect and send to its owners:In addition, ZooPark can take screenshots and photos, and record videos on command. For example, it can take a picture of the phone’s owner from the front camera and send it to its command center.ZooPark Trojan spyware is used for targeted attacks — in other words, it’s not sent out randomly to ensnare just anyone; it aims for a specific audience. As we said, the criminals behind ZooPark target those who are interested in specific topics — in this case, Middle Eastern politics. ZooPark spreads by two main channels: drive-by downloads and Telegram. In the latter case, for example, criminals offered an app on the Telegram channel for voting on the Kurdistan independence referendum. Malefactors also hack some Web resources that are popular in certain countries or circles, making visitors automatically download an infected app that looks like something useful — for example, an official app for the news resource. Finally, in some cases, the malware pretends to be an “all-in-one” messenger.
