UNC215, a Chinese cyber-espionage group, is behind multiple intrusion activities aimed at Israeli organizations, revealed experts. These attacks have been targeting IT services, government institutions, and telecommunications firms since 2019.FireEye's Mandiant threat intelligence has linked the UNC215 threat group with low confidence to an APT identified as APT27 (aka Iron Tiger), which has been active since 2014.For initial access, hackers exploited a SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2019-0604). After that, the group followed a fixed pattern for credential harvesting and internal reconnaissance (via web shells) to detect important systems within the targeted network.Some experts suggest that the Chinese cyberespionage activities in the Middle East and Central Asia may be the steps to safeguard Chinaâ€™s huge investments in the Belt and Road (BRI) initiative in those regions. And as the project progresses, espionage groups such as UNC215 are expected to continue their attacks aimed at critical infrastructure in Israel and the Middle East.
