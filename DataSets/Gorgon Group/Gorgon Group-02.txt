Gorgon Group is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that has conducted targeted attacks against government organisations in the United Kingdom and other nations since February 2018.The group has distributed malware via common URL shortening services, particularly Bitly, in addition to traditional command and control domains. Infection is usually achieved via macros in fake documents and spear phishing emails that link to executable files on remote servers. The initial infection stage also attempts to disable antivirus protection and delete virus definition files. The group's emails often have the appearance of being sent from legitimate individuals and have engaging subject lines such as political topics. The group has used Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and information stealers such as njRAT, NanoCore, Quasar and LokiBot in its activities. Decoy documents may be automatically opened on affected devices to distract users from what is happening in the background.
