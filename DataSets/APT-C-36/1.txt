We have continued tracking APT-C-36, also known as Blind Eagle, since our research on this threat actor in 2019. We share new findings of APT-C-36’s ongoing spam campaign targeting South American entities. We have continued tracking APT-C-36, also known as Blind Eagle, since our research on this threat actor in 2019. We share new findings of APT-C-36’s ongoing spam campaign targeting South American entities. APT-C-36 utilizes different ruses for their targets: Many of the fraudulent emails impersonate Colombia’s national directorate of taxes and customs, Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales (DIAN), a lure that the threat actor has used before. Such emails claim that a “seizure order to bank account has been issued,” further details are contained in the email attachment, and that the information is protected with password “dian” (Figure 1). In English, the attachment means “seizure order.pdf” and the email body translates to the following: APT-C-36 utilizes different ruses for their targets: Many of the fraudulent emails impersonate Colombia’s national directorate of taxes and customs, Dirección de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales (DIAN), a lure that the threat actor has used before. Such emails claim that a “seizure order to bank account has been issued,” further details are contained in the email attachment, and that the information is protected with password “dian” (Figure 1). In English, the attachment means “seizure order.pdf” and the email body translates to the following:The sender’s email address is either a spoofed address impersonating DIAN, or a Hotmail.com address impersonating a fake female profile. The originating IP addresses always belong to a VPN provider. The delivery documents in these phishing emails are either a PDF file or DOCX file containing a link. We have found samples of these documents impersonating DIAN (Figure 3), and others impersonating Google Photos (Figure 4).Hovering over the link will show that the link was generated from a URL shortener. As discussed in our last blog entry on this threat actor, APT-C-36 uses URL shorteners such as cort.as, acortaurl.com and gtly.to. These URL shorteners are capable of geographical targeting, so if a user from a country not targeted by the threat actors clicks on the link, they will be redirected to a legitimate website. The URL shorteners also have the ability to detect the major VPN services, in which case, the shortened link leads the users to a legitimate website instead of redirecting them to the malicious link, as illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.However, if the location criteria are met, then the user is redirected to a file hosting server and a file is automatically downloaded (Figure 7). The downloaded file is a password-protected archive, the password for which is mentioned in the email, the email attachment, or both. These passwords are usually simple, such as “dian,” “foto,” or “1234.”After deobfuscating the executable file within the password-protected archive, we are presented with a RAT called BitRAT. This RAT is not new, it has been previously analyzed by security researchers. Upon analyzing the RAT, the most interesting part of this RAT is its configuration settings seen as an encrypted block of data (Figure 8). There are two hexadecimal strings within the main executable file in BitRAT: the longer string is the encrypted configuration, the shorter one is the first part of the key.Several computational steps are needed to obtain the final key. First, a magic value is computed from bytes found on fixed addresses, as shown in Figures 9 and 10. The configuration is decrypted to the following string, as shown in Figure 11, including a command-and-control (C&C) server and a port.The majority of the targets we discovered were located in Colombia, although some were from other South American countries such as Ecuador, Spain, and Panama. This is consistent with the use of Spanish in spear-phishing emails.Although APT-C-36’s objective remains unclear, we posit that the threat actor carried out this campaign for financial gain. The campaign has affected multiple industries, primarily government, financial, and healthcare entities. We have also seen the campaign affect the finance, telecommunications, and energy, oil and gas industries.Over the course of this investigation, we have found various new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT-C-36. Our research shows that they modify their methods frequently, as evidenced by their use of different link shorteners and RATs. While spear-phishing emails are the initial infection vector for this ongoing campaign, the threat actor is constantly changing their payloads and improving their techniques to avoid detection, such as their use of geolocation filtering. APT-C-36 selects their targets based on location and most likely the financial standing of the email recipient. These, and the prevalence of the emails, lead us to conclude that the threat actor’s ultimate goal is financial gain rather than espionage.Threat actors like APT-C-36 are constantly seeking new ways to deploy their malware and stay one step ahead of their victims’ defenses. To secure their data from spear phishing attempts, companies can benefit from tools such as the Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security solutions, which protect end users and businesses from these kinds of threats by detecting and blocking malicious files, spam messages, and malicious URLs. They can also turn to tools like Trend Micro™ Email Security, a no-maintenance cloud solution that delivers continuously updated protection to stop spam, malware, spear phishing, ransomware, and advanced targeted attacks before they reach the network. It protects Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office 365, Google Apps, and other hosted and on-premises email solutions.
