    "explain":"Magecart Swiper Uses Unorthodox ConcatenationMageCart is the name given to the roughly one dozen groups of cyber criminals targeting e-commerce websites with the goal of stealing credit card numbers and selling them on underground forums. This concatenation technique involves breaking data up so that it’s more difficult to distinguish before and after runtime. An example of this is that instead of the code reading as ‘helloworld’, the attackers have changed it to be ""."h"."e"."".""."llo"."w"."o"."".""."r"."l"."d"."". This method is also encoded using several methods to allow MageCart to exfiltrate credit card data from Magento websites.Analyst Comment: Customer-facing companies that store credit card data must actively defend against Point-of-Sale (POS) threats and stay on top of industry compliance requirements and regulations. All POS networks should be aggressively monitored for these types of threats. In the case of infection, the affected networks should be repopulated. Furthermore, customers should be notified as soon as possible and potentially offered fraud protection to avoid negative media coverage and reputation.MITRE ATT&CK: [MITRE ATT&CK] Standard Application Layer Protocol - T1071 | [MITRE ATT&CK] Data Encoding - T1132 | [MITRE ATT&CK] Obfuscated Files or Information - T1027Tags: MageCart, Infostealer, Magento",
