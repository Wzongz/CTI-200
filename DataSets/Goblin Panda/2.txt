During my last investigation (here), I’ve found two RTFs malware documents with the same techniques of exploitation of CVE-2017– 11882:With the behaviour graph of Joe Sandbox, we can recognize the same interactions with operating system than my last article and the paper of NCC Group.The difference with the version studied by NCC Group is the PackageOle Object. In the article of NCC Group, the researchers talk about aSCT File and many javascript manipulations for dropping the RAT onthe disk and to start it.Here, the payload Ifwe analyze EONEDT32.exe overwritten to recognise the payload, wehave the same technics anti emulation with the same value. In a thread, the process posts in a queue the value 5ACE8D0Ah.The verification is calling GetMessage( and the value is stored in EAXin the function sub 401A60.The comparaison is made in the calling function sub_4027D0.Juste after we found again the loop of decryption for the config. It’s the same algorithm described: a simple XOR loop with rolling key. The mechanism of persistent is the same with a service creation just after dropping differents files and a privilege escalation. We found the same name of the dll file。 If we check the domain contacted by EQNEDT32.exe is kmbk8.hicp.net. This address is a real good pivot. It makes the link with Goblin Panda and SisFader RAT. And the infrastructure is very interesting this domains resolved on three IPs: 122.158.140.100, 122.158.140.100 and 103.255.45.200 Theses addresses can permit to found others domains: Sd123.eicp.net with new IP 180.131.58.9 and cv3sa.gicp.net with new IP 1.188.233.201.Goblin Panda used Sisfader RAT to target the Telecom Firms russian with the same exploitation techniques for Vietnameses Officials.They updated theirs technics than the report of NCC group.
