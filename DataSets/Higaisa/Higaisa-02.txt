Higaisa APT has been known since November 2019, when Tencent researchers first documented its activities. The group was discovered recently, but attackers have been operating for several years and use common tools to complicate the attribution. They mainly use mobile malware and the Gh0st and PlugX trojans. Researchers believe that Higaisa APT is a South Korean state-sponsored group that is focused on government officials and human rights organizations. Since mid-May, the group has been conducting spear-phishing campaigns distributed the LNK file bundled in an archive as malicious attachments. The targets in this campaign are organizations that use the Zeplin collaboration platform. The malicious archive contains two Microsoft shortcut files and a PDF, all of which reference the Zeplin platform. If the victim runs a shortcut file, a multistep infection chain that ultimately deployed a Gh0st RAT agent is initiated. The malware achieves persistence via a scheduled task while masquerading as a legitimate binary in the Windows startup folder. During the infection process, the malware communicates with three different C&C servers. The APT group carried out similar attacks in March using COVID19 themed phishing emails. This week our Threat Bounty Program members published two different rules for detecting attacks of Higaisa APT.
