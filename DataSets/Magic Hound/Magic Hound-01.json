    "explain":"APT35 (aka Charming Kitten, TA453, or Phosphorus), which is suspected to be an Iranian nation-state actor, started widespread scanning and attempts to leverage Log4j flaw in publicly facing systems only four days after the vulnerability was disclosed. The actor’s attack setup was obviously rushed, as they used the basic open-source tool for the exploitation and based their operations on previous infrastructure, which made the attack easier to detect and attribute. APT35 exploiting the Log4j vulnerability and analyze their post-exploitation activities including the new modular PowerShell-based framework dubbed CharmPower, used to establish persistence, gather information, and execute commands. To exploit the Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), the attackers chose one of the publicly available open-source JNDI Exploit Kits, since removed from GitHub due to its enormous popularity following the vulnerability emergence. There are multiple analysis papers that explain how the vulnerability can be exploited, so we will skip the details of the actual exploitation step.To exploit the vulnerable machine, the attackers send a crafted request to the victim’s publicly facing resource. In this case, the payload was sent in the User-Agent or HTTP Authorization headers,After successful exploitation, the exploitation server builds and returns a malicious Java class to be executed on a vulnerable machine. This class runs a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload,It eventually downloads a PowerShell module from an Amazon S3 bucket URL hxxps://s3[.]amazonaws[.]com/doclibrarysales/test[.]txt and then executes it.The downloaded PowerShell payload is the main module responsible for basic communication with the C&C server and the execution of additional modules received. The main module performs the following operations.After all of the data is gathered, the malware starts communication with the C&C server by periodically sending HTTP POST requests to the following URL on the received domain. The downloaded modules are either PowerShell scripts, or C# code. Each decoded module has the following format: language~code~modulename~action, where the action might be stop, start or downloadutil. The latter is relevant only for PowerShell modules.The main module can also change the communication channel: once every 360 C&C loops, it can retrieve a new domain from the actors’ S3 bucket.The modules sent by the C&C are executed by the main module, with each one reporting data back to the server separately. This C&C cycle continues indefinitely, which allows the threat actors to gather data on the infected machine, run arbitrary commands and possibly escalate their actions by performing a lateral movement or executing follow-up malware such as ransomware.Every module is auto-generated by the attackers based on the data sent by the main module: each of the modules contains a hardcoded machine name and a hardcoded C&C domain.This module uses two methods to fetch installed applications. The first is to enumerate Uninstall registry values.The C# script is using a base64-encoded PowerShell command to take a screenshot from multiple screens.This module contains a bunch of PowerShell commands, which oddly enough, are commented-out. The only command that is performed is the systeminfo command.From the commented-out commands, we can get the idea of how the threat actors organize the system information on their end, what data they are interested in, and what they might take into consideration when sending more modules. The threat actors can execute remote commands by running this specialized module with predefined actions. This module attempts to execute a command. It uses the PowerShell Invoke-Expression method for the PowerShell-based module, while its C# implementation has both cmd and PowerShell options.This module will be dropped after the attackers have finished their activity and want to remove any traces from the system. The module contains cleanup methods for persistence-related artifacts in the registry and startup folder, created files, and running processes. This module contains five hardcoded levels, depending on the attack stage, and each one serves a different purpose. The execution level is predetermined by the threat actor in each specific case.CleanupModules function attempts to kill any running processes that are related to previously running modules,Another function in the module tries to erase additional indicators that might be used by the threat actor,Usually, APT actors make sure to change their tools and infrastructure to avoid being detected and make attribution more difficult. APT35, however, does not conform to this behavior. The group is famous in the cybersecurity community for the number of OpSec mistakes in their previous operations, and they tend not to put too much effort into changing their infrastructure once exposed. It’s no wonder that their operation as described here has significant overlaps in the code and infrastructure with previous APT35 activities.In October 2021, Google Threat Analysis Group published an article about APT35 mobile malware. Even though the samples we analyzed are PowerShell scripts, the similarity of coding style between them and the Android spyware that Google attributed to APT35 immediately grabbed our attention. First, the implementation of the logging functions is the same. The Android app uses the following format for logging its operations to the C&C server,The PowerShell modules also contain the same logging format, even though the commands are commented out and replaced with another format. The fact that these lines were not removed outright might indicate that the change was done only recently.The syntax of the logging messages is also identical. Here is the Android app code,Both C&C servers for the mobile and PowerShell variants share the API endpoint /Api/Session. The other API endpoints are similar but not completely identical due to the differences in the functionality and platform. Even more interesting, additional tests showed that not only are the URLs similar, but the C&C domain of the PowerShell variant actually responds to the API requests that are used in the mobile variant.The rest of the API endpoints responded with a 405 HTTP error, which is a different response from a non-existent URL (/Api/RANDOM_STRING always responds with 404 HTTP error).Our conclusion here is that the C&C of the PowerShell variant supports the same C&C communication protocol as the mobile variant. Both C&C servers are running a similar server-side code, and are probably operated by the same threat actor.All the servers we observed in this campaign are hosted by OVH SAS and Hetzner Online GmbH. This is not the first time APT35 used these hosting providers and, combined with the specific pattern that the C&C domains share( 00.xyz), it provides some leads for further hunting. When we investigated the infrastructure, one of the C&C servers we found responded with modules that use 127.0.0.1 as a C&C server. This is probably a development server, as we didn’t see it in a known infection chain. The number of mistakes made in the code of modules also suggests that the PowerShell-based malware is still under active development. The time it takes the C&C server to respond with a module, and the module type it responds with, differs significantly between victims. It could be evidence for a manual operation of the C&C, with the operator deciding which targets are interesting and which ones are not.Multiple activities tracked under the name APT35 include operations that vary significantly in scope, targets, and methods. There are clusters of operations that heavily rely on advanced spear-phishing techniques for surveillance purposes. On the other side, last year, we saw evidence that the actors also entered the ransomware scene. Once again adhering to the adage “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, the day after the described attack began, a subgroup of APT35 launched another large-scale campaign, specifically targeting Israeli networks. This time, instead of utilizing the open-source Log4j exploitation server, they made their own implementation of the exploit, but reused the previously exposed infrastructure dedicated for ransomware operations. The partial code of the malicious Java class, with all the indicators consistent with the analysis by Microsoft & The DFIR Report, shows that the actors seized the opportunity to combine several attack stages for both Windows and Linux into a single exploit.Every time there is a new published critical vulnerability, the entire InfoSec community holds its breath until its worst fears come true: scenarios of real-world exploitation, especially by state-sponsored actors. As we showed in this article, the wait incase of Log4j vulnerability was only a few days. The combination of its simplicity, and the widespread number of vulnerable devices, made this a very attractive vulnerability for actors such as APT35. In these attacks, the actors still used the same or similar infrastructure as in many of their previous attacks. However, judging by their ability to take advantage of the Log4j vulnerability and by the code pieces of the CharmPower backdoor, the actors are able to change gears rapidly and actively develop different implementations for each stage of their attacks.",
