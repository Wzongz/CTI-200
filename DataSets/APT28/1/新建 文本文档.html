During our monitoring of activities around the APT28 threat group, McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts
identified a malicious Word document that appears to leverage the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique that has been previously reported by Advanced Threat Research. This document likely marks the first observed use of this technique by APT28. The use of DDE with PowerShell allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
code on a victim’s system regardless whether macros are enabled. (McAfee product detection is covered in the
Indicators of Compromise section at the end of the document.) 
APT28 has recently focused on using different themes. In this case it capitalized on the recent terrorist attack in
New York City. The document itself is blank. Once opened, the document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader, onto a victim’s system.The domain involved in the distribution of Seduploader was created on October 19, 11 days prior to the creation of
Seduploader.
The document we examined for this post.The document uses the recently detailed DDE technique found in Office products to invoke the command prompt to invoke PowerShell, which runs two commands. The second PowerShell command is Base64 encoded and is found in the version of config.txt received from the remote server. It decodes as follows.
.The PowerShell scripts contact the following URL to download Seduploader:The Seduploader sample has the following artifacts:The document downloads a version of the Seduploader first-stage reconnaissance implant, which profiles prospective victims, pulling basic host information from the infected system to the attackers. If the system is of
interest, then the installation of X-Agent or Sedreco usually follows.We have observed APT28 using Seduploader as a first-stage payload for several years from various public reporting. Based on structural code analysis of recent payloads observed in the campaign, we see they are
identical to previous Seduploader samples employed by APT28.We identified the control server domain associated with this activity as webviewres[.]net, which is consistent with past APT28 domain registration techniques that spoof legitimate-sounding infrastructure. This domain was
registered on October 25, a few days before the payload and malicious documents were created. The domain was
first active on October 29, just days before this version of Seduploader was compiled. The IP currently resolves to 185.216.35.26 and is hosted on the name servers ns1.njal.la and ns2.njal.la.Further McAfee research identified the following related sample.The preceding sample most likely belongs to the same campaign. Based on our analysis it uses the same
techniques and payload. We can clearly establish that the campaign involving documents using DDE techniques
began on October 25.The domain satellitedeluxpanorama[.]com, used by the implant secnt.dll, resolved to 89.34.111.160 as of
November 5. The malicious document 68c2809560c7623d2307d8797691abf3eafe319a is responsible for dropping
the Seduploader payload (secnt.dll). Its original file name was SaberGuardian2017.docx. This document was created on October 27. The document is distributed from hxxp://sendmevideo[.]org/SaberGuardian2017.docx. The
document calls sendmevideo[.]org/dh2025e/eh.dll to download Seduploader
(ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e).
The PowerShell command embedded in this document.The file vms.dll, 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7, is 99% similar-to secnt.dlab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e, indicating the code is almost identical and highly likely to be part
of the same campaign. These two DLL implants are likely part of the same campaign. Furthermore, the sample
4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7, based on our code analysis, is 99% similar to the DLL implant

The payloads,however, are identical for both campaigns.APT28 is a resourceful threat actor that not only capitalizes on recent events to trick potential victims into
infections, but can also rapidly incorporate new exploitation techniques to increase its success. Given the publicity
the Cy Con U.S campaign received in the press, it is possible APT28 actors moved away from using the VBA script
employed in past actions and chose to incorporate the DDE technique to bypass network defenses. Finally, the use
of recent domestic events and a prominent US military exercise focused on deterring Russian aggression highlight
APT28’s ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations.
