In the second half of 2017 Pawn Storm, an extremely active espionage actor group, didn’t shy away from continuing their brazen attacks. Usually, the group’s attacks are not isolated incidents, and we can often relate them to earlier attacks by carefully looking at both technical indicators and motives. Pawn Storm has been attacking political organizations in France, Germany, Montenegro, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States since 2015. We saw attacks against political organizations again in the second half of 2017. These attacks don’t show much technical innovation over time, but they are well prepared, persistent, and often hard to defend against. Pawn Storm has a large toolset full of social engineering tricks, malware and exploits, and therefore doesn’t need much innovation apart from occasionally using their own zero-days and quickly abusing software vulnerabilities shortly after a security patch is released. In summer and fall of 2017, we observed Pawn Storm targeting several organizations with credential phishing and spear phishing attacks. Pawn Storm’s modus operandi is quite consistent over the years, with some of their technical tricks being used repeatedly. For example, tabnabbing was used against Yahoo! users in August and September 2017 in US politically themed email. The method, which we first discussed in 2014, involves changing a browser tab to point to a phishing site after distracting the target. We can often closely relate current and old Pawn Storm campaigns using data that spans more than four years, possibly because the actors in the group follow a script when setting up an attack. This makes sense, as the sheer volume of their attacks requires careful administration, planning, and organization to succeed. The screenshots below show two typical credential phishing emails that targeted specific organizations in October and November 2017. One type of email is supposedly a message from the target’s Microsoft Exchange server about an expired password. The other says there is a new file on the company’s OneDrive system.While these emails might not seem to be advanced in nature, we've seen that credential loss is oftenthe starting point of further attacks that include stealing sensitive data from email inboxes. We haveworked with one of the targets, an NGO in the Netherlands targeted twice, in late October and earlyNovember 2017. We successfully prevented both attacks from causing any harm. in one case we wereable to warn the target within two hours after a dedicated credential phishing site was set up. in anearlier attack, we were able to warn the organization 24 hours before the actual phishing emails weresent. Olympic Wintersports Federations We have seen several international Olympic Wintersport Federations, such as the European lceHockey Federation, the Intermational Ski Federation, the International Biathlon Union, the intemationalBobsleioh and Skeleton Federation and the Interational Luge Federation, among the group's targets inthe second half of 2017, This is noteworthy due to the timing correlation between several RussianOlympic players being banned for life in fall, 2017. in 2016, Pawn Storm had some success incompromising WADA (the World Anti-Doping Agency) and TAS-CAS (the Court of Arbitration for Sport)At that time, Pawn Storm sought active contact with mainstream media either directly or via proxies andhad influence on what some of them published Political targets In the week of the 2017 presidential elections in lran, Pawn Storm set up a phishing site targetingchmail.ir webmail users. We were able to collect evidence that credential phishing emails were sent tochmai.ir users on May 18, 2017, just one day before the presidential elections in lran. We havepreviously reported similar targeted activity against political organizations in France, Germany,Montenegro, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States Beginning in June 2017, phishing sites were set up mimicking the ADFS (Active Directory FederationServices) of the U.S. Senate. By looking at the digital fingerprints of these phishing sites and comparingthem with a large data set that spans almost five years, we can uniquely relate them to a couple ofPawn Storm incidents in 2016 and 2017. The real ADFS server of the U.S, Senate is not reachable onthe open internet, however phishing of users’ credentials on an ADFS server that is behind a firewallstill makes sense. in case an actor already has a foothold in an organization after compromising oneuser account, credential phishina could helo him get closer to high profle users of interest. The future ofpolitically motivated campaignsRogue political influence campaigns are not likely to go away in the near future. Political organizationshave to be able to communicate openly with their voters, the press and the general public. This makesthem vulnerable to hacking and spear phishing. On top of that, it's also relatively easy to influencepublic opinion via social media. Social media platforms continue to form a substantial part of usersonline experience, and they let advertisers reach consumers with their message This makes social media algorithms susceptible to abuse by various actors with bad intentionsPublishing stolen data together with spreading fake news and rumors on social media gives maliciousactors powerful tools. While a successful influence campaign might seem relatively easy to do, it needsa lot of planning, persistence, and resources to be successful. Some of the basic tools and services.ike ones used to soread fake news on social media, are already beina offered as a service in the underground economy. As we have mentioned in our overview paper on Pawn Storm, other actors may also start their owncampaigns that aim to influence politics and issues of interest domestically and abroad. Actors from developing countries will learn and probably adapt similar methods quickly in the near future. in 2016we published a report on C Major, an espionage group that primarily targets the indian military. Bydigging deeper into C Major's activities, we found that this actor group not only attacks the indianmilitary, but also has dedicated botnets for compromised targets in lranian universities, Afghanistanand Pakistan. Recently, we have witnessed C Major also showing some interest in compromisingmilitary and diplomatic targets in the West. lt is only a matter of time before actors like C Major beginattempting to influence public opinion in foreign countries, as well. With the Olympics and several significant global elections taking place in 2018, we can be sure PawnStorm's activities will continue. We at Trend Micro will keep monitoring their targeted activities, as wellas activities of similar actors, as cyberpropaganda and digital extortion remain in use.
