TA505 is a prolific, financially motivated cybercrime group active since 2014 and a significant player in the global cybercrime scene. TA505 has taken many different roles, including as both a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operator and as an affiliate of other apex RaaS operators, as an initial access broker (IAB), and as a customer of other IABs selling access to compromised corporate networks, and as large botnet operator for financial fraud and phishing attacks. TA505 is considered one of the largest, if not the largest, phishing and malspam distributors worldwide and is estimated to have compromised more than 3,000 US-based and 8,000 global organizations. TA505 uses a sophisticated and ever-shifting set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) as they attempt to outpace the evolving cybersecurity landscape with novel and undetectable exploits. From 2014 until 2018, TA505's primary attack strategy was using Dridex botnets to operate infostealing campaigns and targeting the financial sector using stolen credentials. However, since 2018 TA505 has shifted its focus to target universities, hospitals, and manufacturing companies with ransomware as its primary modus operandi and selectively infecting victims with cryptocurrency mining malware.TA505's Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) TA505's attack TTP and use of malware toolkits have evolved significantly during their lifespan. The group is known to orchestrate attacks using a wide array of popular malware payloads such as Dridex, Trickbot, and Locky, as well as built-in Windows tools and customized malware exclusive to TA505. TA505 is also known for a long-term cyberattack lifecycle; they will dwell in a target's network conducting reconnaissance for weeks—even months—while avoiding detection to identify the highest value target possible.Dridex (AKA Bugat, Cridex): an infostealer and trojan with sophisticated botnet capabilities Dridex was one of the first malware strains in heavy use by TA505 Trickbot: a sophisticated multi-purpose attack tool first used by TA505 in 2017 FlawedGrace (AKA Gracewire): a remote access trojan (RAT) almost exclusively used by TA505 since 2018 FlawedAmmyy: a second-stage malware that establishes a connection to TA505's remote command and control (C2) servers that can import additional attack tools Snatch: an infostealer that exfiltrates sensitive data such as login credentials and personal data SDBbot: an application shimming malware that injects malicious code into a standard process each time an infected system is booted ServHelper: a prevalent RAT malware with first and second-stage capabilities used by TA505 between November 2018 to mid-2019 TinyMet: a RAT malware with additional functionality to delete system logs and eliminate traces of a malware infection TeslaGun: a GUI tool for managing ServHelper malware that fetches the infected host's CPU, GPU, RAM, and internet connection speed and launches crypto-mining malware on suitable victims Get2 (AKA Friendspeak): a social networking app used by TA505 for phishing and spreading malware infections to grow zombie botnet operations Quant Loader: a simple second-stage downloader commonly distributed on dark web sites and used by TA505 since 2018 Marap: a somewhat sophisticated second-stage downloader that avoids detection and maintains persistence Andromut (AKA Gelup): an Android-specific downloader with anti-analysis obfuscation exclusively used by TA505 in 2019 Remote Manipulator System (RMS or RmanSyS): a legitimate system administration tool developed by the Russian company TEKTONIT, in use by TA505 from November 2018 until June 2019 FlowerPippi: a first-stage system reconnaissance, downloader, and simple RAT MineDoor: a malware that targets servers running the popular Minecraft game servers and uses infected servers to mine cryptocurrency Additional TA505 attack TTP include: Compromising Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to corporate networks Utilizing a "Living Off The Land" (LOTL) attack strategy that utilizes existing preinstalled Windows system tools and commands Leveraging legitimate pen-testing and remote access tools such as Cobalt Strike Using Dridex, Necurs, and Amadey botnets to automate fraudulent financial transactions and for phishing and malspam distribution Migrating C2 proxy servers within and between data centers for increased detection avoidance Using a wide number of distinct ransomware strains, including Locky, Bart, Jaff, Scarab, Philadelphia, GlobeImposter, GandCrab, and Clop (which is exclusively developed and used by TA505) Operating as an intermediary broker in both the sale and purchase of initial access to corporate networks as both a RaaS operator and affiliate Digitally signing their malware using stolen private keys from legitimate software vendors and decoding software binaries in memory to avoid detection from endpoint security products Using known Active Directory and SMB vulnerabilities to move laterally through a victim's network Installing PHP web shells on compromised websites to maintain remote control and using the infected site to spread malicious documents and links Detecting and disabling IT security tools, including Malwarebytes, Webroot, Panda Security, ESET, Kaspersky, AppCheck, Windows Defender, and Microsoft Security Essentials Impersonating standard online file-sharing tools such as DropBox, OneDrive, and Google Drive Displaying fake malware scan graphics to instill a false sense of security in victims
