Security researchers at Adaptive Mobile who discovered the SimJacker issue have published the list of countries where mobile operators use flawed SIM cards. Exactly one month ago, researchers at AdaptiveMobile Security disclosed a critical vulnerability in SIM cards dubbed SimJacker that could be exploited by remote attackers to compromise targeted mobile phones and spy on victims just by sending an SMS. The SimJacker vulnerability resides in the S@T (SIMalliance Toolbox) Browser dynamic SIM toolkit that is embedded in most SIM cards used by mobile operators in many countries. The experts discovered that that the exploitation of the vulnerability is independent of the model of phone used by the victim. Now Adaptive Mobile published the list of countries where local mobile operators are using SIM cards affected by the Simjacker flaw, anyway the company did not name the impacted mobile phone carriers. “This varies by country and region. From our analysis we could identify 61 Mobile Operators (excluding MVNOs) in the 29 countries that use this technology.” reads the report. “Based on public reported information the cumulative subscriber numbers of these S@T Browser-using Operators comes to ~861 million mobile connections (SIM cards).” “Not all SIM cards in the operator may use this technology. In discussions with a few operators in the LATAM region we were informed that the majority of SIM Cards (>90%) in their network had it.”
