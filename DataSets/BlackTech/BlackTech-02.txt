On September 27, 2023, The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a joint advisory on a Chinese APT group called BlackTech [1]. BlackTech is known to target organizations working with US and Japanese militaries for cyber espionage and theft of sensitive information. The APT group is capable of modifying router firmware, deploying backdoors in victims' networks, and moving laterally between networks while evading detection.BlackTech is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Group linked to the People's Republic of China (PRC). The APT group first appeared in 2010 and is known to target US and East Asian public organizations and private companies. Considering their tools and techniques, BlackTech actors aim to establish persistence and exfiltrate sensitive data from their victims for extended periods of time while evading detection. Their effort and emphasis on defense evasion show that BlackTech focuses on cyber espionage. BlackTech uses a series of malware affecting Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD and updates them regularly. Using stolen code signing certificates, adversaries sign the malware to make them appear legitimate and evade their victims' defense. BlackTech also uses Living-off-the-Land tools and techniques to blend in with benign operating systems and network activities. The most noteworthy attack technique utilized by BlackTech is modifying router firmware without detection. Threat actors use this sophisticated technique to establish persistence, disable logging, move laterally, and hide their C2 communication. Tools Used by BlackTech APT Group BlackTech threat actors use several custom malware and remote access tools (RATs) in their attack campaigns. By continuously updating these tools, BlackTech avoids being detected and remains persistent in their victims' environment. The malicious software used by BlackTech is as follows: BendyBear BendyBear is a type of shellcode loader. Shellcode loaders are specialized tools used by adversaries to load and execute malicious code (shellcode) onto a compromised system, typically with the intent of establishing persistence or performing some malicious activity while evading detection. BendyBear uses polymorphic code and operates entirely on memory to evade detection mechanisms. These features also hinder malware analysis and prevent defenders and automated tools from understanding its true purpose and functionality. Bifrose Bifrose is a notorious backdoor that was discovered back in 2004. It evolved over time and gained new features during its nearly 20-year history. Bifrose is primarily a remote access trojan (RAT), which means it allows an attacker to remotely control an infected machine without the user's knowledge or consent. The primary purpose of such trojans is to grant unauthorized access to an attacker, essentially turning the infected machine into a "zombie" that can be commanded as part of a larger botnet or for individual malicious purposes. Bifrose has keylogging for collecting keystrokes and reverse connection capability to bypass firewall restrictions. BTSDoor BTSDoor is a backdoor malware developed by the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor BlackTech. It is typically delivered via spear-phishing emails that contain malicious attachments, such as weaponized Word or Excel documents. Once opened, these attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to install BTSDoor on the victim's computer. BTSDoor establishes a covert communication channel with an adversary-controlled command and control (C2) server. Through this covert channel, adversaries steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, and establish persistence. FakeDead (aka TSCookie) & FrontShell FakeDead, also known as TSCookie, is an infostealer and loader malware. The malware is modular in nature and employs several evasion techniques, such as code obfuscation and process injection. After the victim is infected by TSCookie, the malware downloads and executes a remote access trojan named TSCookieRAT to establish persistence. TSCookie is used by adversaries for credential theft, data exfiltration, and deploying additional malware. BlackTech APT group uses FrontShell as a downloader for FakeDead. FlagPro FlagPro is a first-stage downloader designed to infiltrate and compromise Windows systems. Once a system is infected, FlagPro collects information from the compromised host and sends it to an adversary-controlled C2 server. It can also execute commands in the infected system and install additional malware downloaded from the C2 server. For more detailed information about it, check out our blog on FlagPro malware. IconDown IconDown is a downloader malware that abuses Windows shortcut files with a .lnk extension to download and deploy malicious payloads. The use of Windows shortcut files appears benign to legitimate users and helps malware avoid immediate suspicion. This technique is also leveraged to bypass traditional antivirus solutions since they might overlook .lnk files. IconDown can be the initial stage for a larger cyber attack campaign. When executed by an unsuspecting victim, IconDown malware contacts the attackers' C2 server to download additional malware and exfiltrate sensitive data. PLEAD PLEAD is a modular remote access trojan (RAT) designed to exfiltrate sensitive documents and information from compromised systems. The main entry point for PLEAD malware is typically spear-phishing emails. These are targeted email campaigns where the attacker sends a seemingly legitimate email to a specific individual or organization with malicious attachments or links to compromise the system. PLEAD is often used for credential theft, lateral movement, C2 communication, and data exfiltration in cyber espionage campaigns. WaterBear WaterBear is modular malware, meaning it consists of a core set of functionalities that can be expanded upon with additional modules depending on the specific needs and objectives of an attack. Adversaries often choose WaterBear because of its capability to reside in the computer's boot sector, making it more resistant to typical removal techniques. BlackTech threat actors use WaterBear to exfiltrate data from compromised systems and move laterally in the victim's environment.
