This report provides further details of 
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures 
(TTPs) associated with SVR cyber 
actors. SVR cyber actors are known 
and tracked in open source as APT29, 
Cozy Bear, and the Dukes. 
UK and US governments recently 
attributed SVR’s responsibility for a 
series of cyber-attacks, including the 
compromise of SolarWinds and the 
targeting of COVID-19 vaccine 
developers.
Alongside this attribution, the United 
States’ National Security Agency 
(NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI), and Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
released an advisory detailing the 
exploits most recently used by the 
group. The FBI, Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) and CISA
also issued an alert providing 
information on the SVR’s cyber tools, 
targets, techniques and capabilities. 
The SVR is Russia’s civilian foreign 
intelligence service. The group uses a 
variety of tools and techniques to 
predominantly target overseas 
governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, 
healthcare and energy targets globally
for intelligence gain. The SVR is a 
technologically sophisticated and 
highly capable cyber actor. It has 
developed capabilities to target 
organisations globally, including in the 
UK, US, Europe, NATO member
states and Russia’s neighbours.
The NCSC, NSA, CISA and CSE
previously issued a joint report
regarding the group’s targeting of 
organisations involved in COVID-19 
vaccine development throughout 2020 
using WellMess and WellMail 
malware. 
SVR cyber operators appear to have 
reacted to this report by changing their 
TTPs in an attempt to avoid further 
detection and remediation efforts by 
network defenders.
These changes included the 
deployment of the open-source tool 
Sliver in an attempt to maintain their 
accesses.
The group has also been observed 
making use of numerous 
vulnerabilities, most recently the 
widely reported Microsoft Exchange 
vulnerability.
As previously reported, the group frequently uses publicly available exploits to 
conduct widespread scanning (T1595.002) and exploitation (T1190) against 
vulnerable systems. The group seeks to take full advantage of a variety of exploits 
when publicised. The group have used:
This list should not be treated as exhaustive. The group will look to rapidly exploit 
recently released public vulnerabilities which are likely to enable initial access to their 
targets. More information about these exploits can be found in previous NCSC 
advisories on Citrix and VPN vulnerabilities.
Most recently, the group has also scanned for Microsoft Exchange servers
vulnerable to CVE-2021-26855. Such activity is typically followed by the use of 
further exploits and deployment of a webshell (T1505.003) if successful. Other 
Microsoft Exchange exploits commonly used in conjunction with this CVE include:
More information about these exploits and mitigation advice can be found on the 
NCSC website.
The SolarWinds campaign demonstrates the actor’s willingness to target 
organisations that supply privileged software (T1195.002), such as network 
management or security applications, to many users or organisations. 
These types of attacks give SVR actors initial access to a large number of 
organisations. From this initial access, the actors select a much smaller number of 
victims for follow-on compromise activity. These victims are targeted in line with 
intelligence priorities. 
Enterprise products and applications deployed across multiple organisations will be
attractive supply chain targets. Products which require access to a significant portion 
of user or network data to operate are likely to be especially attractive targets. Earlier 
this year Mimecast and SolarWinds acknowledged compromises, now known to be 
conducted by SVR cyber operators.
NCSC and partner industry analysis shows that on multiple occasions, SVR actors 
used Cobalt Strike, a commercial Red Team command and control framework, to 
carry out their operations after initial exploitation (e.g. compromise of SolarWinds 
platform). 
The group also deployed GoldFinder, GoldMax and Sibot malware after 
compromising a victim via SolarWinds. GoldMax is a custom backdoor, GoldFinder 
is a custom tool – both are written in Golang. Sibot is a simple custom downloader 
and, unlike other malware in recent use by the group, is written in VBS (T1059.005).
Microsoft’s analysis of this malware can be found here. 
In separate incidents, the NCSC observed that once SVR actors had gained initial 
access to a victim’s network, they then made use of the open-source Red Team 
command and control framework named Sliver.
Following the publication of the joint WellMess Advisory SVR cyber operators used 
the Sliver framework. Sliver is an “…open source, cross-platform adversary 
simulation/red team platform…” written in Golang that supports command and 
control mechanisms over a variety of protocols including Mutual-TLS (T1573.002), 
HTTP/S (T1071.001) and DNS (T1071.004). 
The use of the Sliver framework was likely an attempt to ensure access to a number 
of the existing WellMess and WellMail victims was maintained following the exposure 
of those capabilities. As observed with the SolarWinds incidents, SVR operators 
often used separate command and control infrastructure for each victim of Sliver.
SVR actors have used methods other than malware to maintain persistence on high 
value targets, including the use of stolen credentials.SVR actors often target administrator mailboxes in order to acquire further network 
information and access. This is likely in an effort to better understand the target 
network and obtain further privileges or credentials for persistence and/or lateral 
movement.
In one example identified by the NCSC, the actor had searched for authentication 
credentials in mailboxes, including passwords and PKI keys (T1552). 
In another incident, the actor leveraged access gained from the SolarWinds 
campaign to compromise a certificate (T1552.004) issued by Mimecast. The actor 
used that access to authenticate a subset of Mimecast’s products with customer 
systems (T1199). In this way, the actor was able to abuse the Mimecast Azure app
in order to compromise the final target. 
The Mimecast Azure application's default application permissions allowed the 
application full access to all mailboxes in the victim organisation's tenant. Once the 
actor had gained access to this application, they were able to utilise the applications 
permissions in order to extract emails from any mailbox used by the victim 
organisation (T1114.002). For reference, the default permissions that were granted 
to the Mimecast application can be seen below, along with a definition of the 
permission:
As a result, no further privilege escalation or lateral movement was needed by the 
actor to access emails of interest.
Mandiant FireEye has detailed a number of detection and mitigation strategies that 
will help organisations proactively harden Microsoft O365 environments against 
these techniques. This includes recommendations on how to detect suspicious 
modifications in a user’s O365 mailbox permissions. 
This advisory has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, a 
globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on 
real-world observations.
The SVR targets organisations that align with Russian foreign intelligence interests, 
including governmental, think-tank, policy and energy targets, as well as more timebound targeting, for example COVID-19 vaccine targeting in 2020. 
Organisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice and guidance below, as well 
as the detection rules in the appendix to help protect against this activity. 
Organisations should also follow the advice and guidance in the recently published 
NSA advisory and the FBI and CISA alert, which detail further TTPs linked to SVR 
cyber actors. 
UK organisations affected by the activity outlined in should report any suspected 
compromises to the NCSC via the website.
