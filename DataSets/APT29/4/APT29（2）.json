claim：The SVR targets organisations that align with Russian foreign intelligence interests, including governmental, think-tank, policy and energy targets, as well as more time bound targeting, for example COVID-19 vaccine targeting in 2020.  
explain：This report provides further details of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) associated with SVR cyber actors. SVR cyber actors are known and tracked in open source as APT29, Cozy Bear, and the Dukes. UK and US governments recently attributed SVR’s responsibility for a series of cyber-attacks, including the compromise of SolarWinds and the targeting of COVID-19 vaccine developers. Alongside this attribution, the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an advisory detailing the exploits most recently used by the group. The FBI, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and CISA also issued a joint report providing information on the SVR’s cyber tools, targets, techniques, and capabilities. The SVR is Russia’s civilian foreign intelligence service. The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target overseas governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets globally for intelligence gain. The SVR is a technologically sophisticated and highly capable cyber actor. It has developed capabilities to target organisations globally, including in the UK, US, Europe, NATO member states and Russia’s neighbours. The NCSC, NSA, CISA and CSE previously issued a joint report regarding the group’s targeting of organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development throughout 2020 using WellMess and WellMail malware. SVR cyber operators appear to have reacted to this report by changing their TTPs in an attempt to avoid further detection and remediation efforts by network defenders. These changes included the deployment of the open-source tool Sliver in an attempt to maintain their accesses. The group has also been observed making use of numerous vulnerabilities, most recently the widely reported Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. As previously reported, the group frequently uses publicly available exploits to conduct widespread scanning (T1595.002) and exploitation (T1190) against vulnerable systems. The group seeks to take full advantage of a variety of exploits when publicised. The group has used:This list should not be treated as exhaustive. The group will look to rapidly exploit recently released public vulnerabilities which are likely to enable initial access to their targets. More information about these exploits can be found in previous NCSC advisories on Citrix and VPN vulnerabilities. Most recently, the group has also scanned for Microsoft Exchange servers vulnerable to CVE-2021-26855. Such activity is typically followed by the use of further exploits and deployment of a webshell (T1505.003) if successful. Other Microsoft Exchange exploits commonly used in conjunction with this CVE include: More information about these exploits and mitigation advice can be found on the NCSC website.The SolarWinds campaign demonstrates the actor’s willingness to target organisations that supply privileged software (T1195.002), such as network management or security applications, to many users or organisations. These types of attacks give SVR actors initial access to a large number of organisations. From this initial access, the actors select a much smaller number of victims for follow-on compromise activity. These victims are targeted in line with intelligence priorities. Enterprise products and applications deployed across multiple organisations will be attractive supply chain targets. Products which require access to a significant portion of user or network data to operate are likely to be especially attractive targets. Earlier this year Mimecast and SolarWinds acknowledged compromises, now known to be conducted by SVR cyber operators. NCSC and partner industry analysis shows that on multiple occasions, SVR actors used Cobalt Strike, a commercial Red Team command and control framework, to carry out their operations after initial exploitation (e.g. compromise of SolarWinds platform). The group also deployed GoldFinder, GoldMax and Sibot malware after compromising a victim via SolarWinds. GoldMax is a custom backdoor, GoldFinder is a custom tool – both are written in Golang. Sibot is a simple custom downloader and, unlike other malware in recent use by the group, is written in VBS (T1059.005). Microsoft’s analysis of this malware can be found here. In separate incidents, the NCSC observed that once SVR actors had gained initial access to a victim’s network, they then made use of the open-source Red Team command and control framework named Sliver. Following the publication of the joint WellMess Advisory SVR cyber operators used the Sliver framework. Sliver is an “…open source, cross-platform adversary simulation/red team platform…” written in Golang that supports command and control mechanisms over a variety of protocols including Mutual-TLS (T1573.002), HTTP/S (T1071.001) and DNS (T1071.004). The use of the Sliver framework was likely an attempt to ensure access to a number of the existing WellMess and WellMail victims was maintained following the exposure of those capabilities. As observed with the SolarWinds incidents, SVR operators often used separate command and control infrastructure for each victim of Sliver. SVR actors have used methods other than malware to maintain persistence on high value targets, including the use of stolen credentials.SVR actors often target administrator mailboxes in order to acquire further network information and access. This is likely in an effort to better understand the target network and obtain further privileges or credentials for persistence and/or lateral movement. In one example identified by the NCSC, the actor had searched for authentication credentials in mailboxes, including passwords and PKI keys (T1552). In another incident, the actor leveraged access gained from the SolarWinds campaign to compromise a certificate (T1552.004) issued by Mimecast. The actor used that access to authenticate a subset of Mimecast’s products with customer systems (T1199). In this way, the actor was able to abuse the Mimecast Azure app in order to compromise the final target. The Mimecast Azure application's default application permissions allowed the application full access to all mailboxes in the victim organisation's tenant. Once the actor had gained access to this application, they were able to utilise the applications permissions in order to extract emails from any mailbox used by the victim organisation (T1114.002). For reference, the default permissions that were granted to the Mimecast application can be seen below, along with a definition of the permission: As a result, no further privilege escalation or lateral movement was needed by the actor to access emails of interest.Mandiant FireEye has detailed a number of detection and mitigation strategies that will help organisations proactively harden Microsoft O365 environments against these techniques. This includes recommendations on how to detect suspicious modifications in a user’s O365 mailbox permissions. The SVR targets organisations that align with Russian foreign intelligence interests, including governmental, think-tank, policy and energy targets, as well as more time bound targeting, for example COVID-19 vaccine targeting in 2020. Organisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice and guidance below, as well as the detection rules in the appendix to help protect against this activity. Organisations should also follow the advice and guidance in the recently published joint NSA/CISA/FBI advisory and the subsequent joint FBI/DHS/CISA report, which detail further TTPs linked to SVR cyber actors. Reporting to the NCSC UK organisations affected by the activity outlined in should report any suspected compromises to the NCSC via the website.
