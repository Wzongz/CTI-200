Red Eyes attack group has also been tracked as Geumseong121, Group 123, ScarCruft, APT37, Reaper, and Ricochet Chollima. Based on the contents of malicious files used in the attacks, it appears that its main targets are organizations and individuals whose work involves North Korea. These include North Korean defectors, human rights activists for North Korea, North Korean researchers, and journalists. In some cases, it has even accessed South Korean military related documents. Red Eyes group’s main method is to send a document via email or mobile messenger to deliver the malware. Typically, executable files in formats such as .vbs or .exe are inserted in documents. The group also exploits the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) vulnerability of the Hangul word-processing program, which is widely used throughout South Korea. Microsoft Office documents have also been used in attacks. In October 2017, the group launched an attack that exploited Microsoft Word’s Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) feature. In February 2018, Red Eyes exploited the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). 1 It was later revealed, however, that the first such attack had taken place in November 2017. Then, in March 2018, Red Eyes launched a targeted mobile malware attack.2 The activities of Red Eyes were first detected in the fall of 2016, not long after the disappearance of an earlier group of hackers that were active from 2015 to the spring of 2016. That earlier group carried out Operation ProgamsByMe in 2015 and is thought to be affiliated with Red Eyes. Red Eyes use a variety of methods and is known to include text strings within their code such as “First,” “Happy,” and “Work.” In this report, we will take a closer look at the main activities of Red Eyes and another group that may be affiliated with it.Hacking attempts have targeted North Korean defectors and human rights activists for North Korea over the course of five years. In one case, a website operated by North Korean defectors was attacked. An investigation carried out by major domestic and overseas security vendors revealed that some of the attacks were the work of a group called Red Eyes. Red Eyes attack group is also known as Geumseong121, Group 123, ScarCruft, APT37, Reaper, and Ricochet Chollima. Based on the contents of malicious files used in the attacks, it appears that its main targets are organizations and individuals whose work involves North Korea. These include North Korean defectors, human rights activists for North Korea, North Korean researchers, and journalists. In some cases, it has even accessed Korean military related documents. The information about the group was first reported by Cisco Talos, a threat intelligence team, in 2017,3 but Red Eyes received more attention at the end of January 2018, when it launched an attack that exploited the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). 4 Soon after, cybersecurity companies released their findings: FireEye released its analysis of the group in February,5 and in March, ESTsecurity announced its findings on mobile malware that had been distributed through a mobile messenger.Malware with Red Eyes characteristics were discovered repeatedly beginning in the fall of 2016 through the end of 2017. The occurrence of the malware is shown in Figure 1. Most of the malware took the form of document files, droppers, or backdoors.One of the characteristics of malware from this group is that it uses a program database (PDB) text string. Table 1 shows the PDB text strings that were used to gain information about the malware, such as its version and type.Red Eyes spreads malware mainly by sending malicious email attachments to their targets. In March 2018, it also used mobile messenger texts to send malware. They mainly exploit the EPS vulnerability of the Hangul (.hwp) word-processing program, which is widely used in South Korea, or used the method of inserting executable files, such as .vbs or .exe. They also use Microsoft Office documents for attacks. In October 2017, the group launched an attack that exploited Microsoft Word’s DDE feature. Then, in February 2018, it used a Microsoft Office file to exploit the zero-day Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878). This method of attack was later identified to have first taken place in November 2017. The group first exploited the EPS vulnerability of the Hangul word program in the fall of 2016. The malicious documents concerned academic conferences and news about North Korea and matters relating to North Korean defectors. In January 2017, a Hangul file containing the new year address of North Korea was used in an email attachment attack that used the file as loader for in-memory execution of another malware. A variant of this malware was found in November 2016. In February 2017, a DogCall backdoor was found in a Hangul file disguised as a résumé. The DDEbased attacks took place in late October and November 2017. In November 2017, Red Eyes used an attack method where a .vbs file was linked in the body of a Hangul file concerning a civic organization for human rights in North Korea. (md5: 7ca1e08fc07166a440576d1af0a15bb1). If the user clicks on the text, an HncModuleUpdate.vbs file is executed to perform malicious tasks. At the end of January 2018, the Korea National Computer Emergency Response Team (krCERT) within the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) announced that it had discovered the Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability. In fact, however, a similar attack had occurred in November 2017 using a document on cosmetics prices. The malicious Hangul document (md5: 44bdeb6c0af7c36a08c64e31ceadc63c) discovered in January 2017, masquerading as the New Year address of North Korea, had an executable file inserted. Malware is executed if the user clicks on the file. When an object is inserted in a Hangul file, it is possible to check the original file path as shown in Figure 3. This information can provide clues as to who may have developed the malware.As shown in Figure 3, the original file was attached from a path where the username of the system was “pad-2” and the mapped network folder was called "saggazi." The path also included the name of a university in South Korea and a name in Korean characters. Based on the presence of Korean characters and “saggazi,” a transliteration of a Korean word, it can be assumed that the malware creator is Korean or someone who is familiar with the language. The Reloader (DocPrint) executes another malware in-memory using a wscript.exe file. The actual malware is encrypted and a similar decryption code is found in its variants.Reloaderx (md5: 6Cec7de9d4797895775e2add9d6855ba) is executed in-memory by DocPrint (md5: 0ff0f3f0722dd122a0f5c3d4c7752675, fc0a9850f7b6a91f7757d64c86cfc141), which was inserted in the Hangul file disguised as the 2017 New Year address of North KoreaRedoor, also known as DogCall or ROKRAT, was first discovered in February 2017. Redoor is the malware executed by Reloader that acts as a loader. Until January 2017, Reloader executed Reloaderx, but in February of that year it began executing Redoor. It is a commonly used backdoor, and was used as recently as March 2018.One kind of malware used by Red Eyes group destroys all data on the hard disk when executed. After destroying the data and rebooting the system, it would display the message “Are you Happy?” as shown in Figure 5.In the aforementioned cases involving the Hangul document, we saw that the malware creator’s system username was “pad-2” and that the file path included text strings such as “First,” “Happy,” and “Work.” This suggests an association between the Hangul attacks and other attacks that have occurred since 2015. Operation ProgamsByMe started in July 2015 and continued until April 2016. The characteristic of this malware is that it contained the text string “ProgamsByMe,” which could reflect either a typographical error or an intentional misspelling of “Programs.” The attack group that carried out this attack sent email to the targets, either exploiting the vulnerabilities of Hangul or disguising the malware as an update for another popular program. In one case, malware was distributed via a specific Active-X installation file. This group of hackers attempted to attack an ICT company in May 2015 by disguising malware as a security update (malware removal and patch update) for the Hancom Office suite, which includes Hangul (md5 : 89c3254aa577d3788f0f402fe6e5a855).In January 2016, this group distributed malware (md5: 06ae5d62d56f21cd2676989743b9626c) purporting to discuss countermeasures to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, “Truth and countermeasures on North Korea's hydrogen bomb game.hwp”. In February 2016, it used malware (md5: d00e3196bc847e63fc4b255e8ab06d1c) disguised as a piracy investigation program of the Korean National Police Agency (md5: f793deeee9dc4235d228e68d27057dcc). In March 2016, the group attacked a media organization and additionally installed keyloggers.The malware used in the attacks listed in Table 6 all contain the PDB string “ProgamsByMe.” It also includes text strings such as “First,” “Happy,” and “Work,” and include the use of a tilde (~) for the date of creation.Another management program used by the attacker (md5: 49d30adaab769fbea2ef69e09c6598c5) is called Manager of Zombies Version 1.0. In the program information, the malware creators refer to themselves as the “Team,” as shown in Figure 10.As mentioned before, the document distributed in 2017 disguised as the New Year address of North Korea (md5: 44bdeb6c0af7c36a08c64e31ceadc63c) came from a person whose system username was “pad-2.” However, malware designed from the system where the username was “pad-1” was discovered from December 2016 to January 2017. This malware included the following PDB: C:\Users\pad1\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\ConsoleApplication9\Release\ConsoleApplication9.pdb.A variant (md5: f0a5385d0d9f7c546b25a7448ca5b1c9) of ConsoleApplication5.pdb was downloaded in December 2016 from the address http://www.i***.com/admin/data/bbs/review2/im/jquery_min_1.5.1.js. This web address (i ***.com) is identical to the address used in Red Eyes attacks that took place in January and March 2017. No PDB information exists, but malware (md5: f613c9276d0deb19d0959aa2fbfc737c) from the same decryption code as the one that contained the pad-1 string included a screen capture function and a way of collecting system information. By the fall of 2017, nine variants of this malware had been found.The Red Eyes group appeared in the fall of 2016 and is now drawing significant attention. The group uses a variety of methods but can be identified by a code that includes text strings such as “First,” “Happy,” and “Work.” Red Eyes may very well be behind Operation ProgamsByMe, which took place in 2015; it is likely that they are at least associated with it either directly or indirectly. Red Eyes appeared right after the disappearance of a group that was active in 2015 through to the spring of 2016. This suggests that the activities of Red Eyes in South Korea date back to 2015, and possibly even earlier. Because the hackers seem to have used the same source code but different compilation paths for the malware, we can conclude that there is more than one attacker involved. Currently, the Red Eyes group is targeting other countries in addition to South Korea. There is a clear need to continue monitoring its movements.
