NCC Group’s global Cyber Incident Response Team has observed an increase in Clop
ransomware victims in the past weeks. The surge can be traced back to a vulnerability in
SolarWinds Serv-U that is being abused by the TA505 threat actor. TA505 is a known
cybercrime threat actor, who is known for extortion attacks using the Clop ransomware.
We believe exploiting such vulnerabilities is a recent initial access technique for TA505,
deviating from the actor’s usual phishing-based approach.
NCC Group strongly advises updating systems running SolarWinds Serv-U software to
the most recent version (at minimum version 15.2.3 HF2) and checking whether
exploitation has happened as detailed below.
We are sharing this information as a call to action for organisations using SolarWinds
Serv-U software and incident responders currently dealing with Clop ransomware.
During multiple incident response investigations, NCC Group found that a vulnerable
version of SolarWinds Serv-U server appeared to be the initial access used by TA505 to
breach its victims’ IT infrastructure. The vulnerability being exploited is known as CVE2021-35211 [1].
SolarWinds published a security advisory [2] detailing the vulnerability in the Serv-U
software on July 9, 2021. The advisory mentions that Serv-U Managed File Transfer and
Serv-U Secure FTP are affected by the vulnerability. On July 13, 2021, Microsoft
published an article [3] on CVE-2021-35211 being abused by a Chinese threat actor
referred to as DEV-0322. Here we describe how TA505, a completely different threat
actor, is exploiting that vulnerability.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability, as described by Microsoft [3], causes Serv-U
to spawn a subprocess controlled by the adversary. That enables the adversary to run
commands and deploy tools for further penetration into the victim’s network.
Exploitation also causes Serv-U to log an exception, as described in the section below on
checks for potential compromise.
We observed that Base64 encoded PowerShell commands were logged shortly after the
Serv-U exceptions indicating exploitation. The PowerShell commands ultimately led to
deployment of a Cobalt Strike Beacon on the system running the vulnerable Serv-U
software.
The PowerShell command observed deploying Cobalt Strike was:
On several occasions the threat actor tried to maintain its foothold by hijacking a
scheduled task named RegIdleBackup and abusing the COM handler associated with it to
execute malicious code, leading to FlawedGrace RAT.
The RegIdleBackup task is a legitimate task that is stored in
\Microsoft\Windows\Registry. The task is normally used to regularly backup the registry
hives. By default, the CLSID in the COM handler is set to: {CA767AA8-9157-4604-B64B40747123D5F2}. In all cases where we observed the threat actor abusing the task for
persistence, the COM handler was altered to a different CLSID.
CLSID objects are stored in registry in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID. In our
investigations the task included a suspicious CLSID, which subsequently redirected to
another CLSID. The second CLSID included three objects containing the FlawedGrace
RAT loader. The objects contain Base64 encoded strings that ultimately lead to the
executable.
NCC Group recommends looking for potentially vulnerable Serv-U FTP-servers in your
network and checking these logs for traces of similar exceptions as suggested by the
SolarWinds security advisory. It is important to note that the publications by Microsoft
and SolarWinds describe follow-up activity regarding a completely different threat actor
than we observed in our investigations.
Microsoft’s article [3] on CVE-2021-35211 provides guidance on the detection of the
abuse of the vulnerability. The first indicator of compromise for the exploitation of this
vulnerability are suspicious entries in a Serv-U log file named DebugSocketlog.txt. This
log file is usually located in the Serv-U installation folder. Looking at this log file it
contains exceptions at the time of exploitation of CVE-2021-35211. NCC Group’s analysts
encountered the following exceptions during their investigations:
However, as mentioned in Microsoft’s article, this exception is not by definition an
indicator of successful exploitation and therefore further analysis should be carried out to
determine potential compromise.
Analysts should look for suspicious PowerShell commands being executed close to the
date and time of the exceptions. The full content of PowerShell commands is usually
recorded in Event ID 4104 in the Windows Event logs.
Analysts should look for the RegIdleBackup task with an altered CLSID. Subsequently,
the suspicious CLSID should be used to query the registry and check for objects
containing Base64 encoded strings. The following PowerShell commands assist in
checking for the existence of the hijacked task and suspicious CLSID content:
The following steps should be taken to check whether exploitation led to a suspected
compromise by TA505:
There are currently still many vulnerable internet-accessible Serv-U servers online
around the world.
In July 2021 after Microsoft published about the exploitation of Serv-U FTP servers by
DEV-0322, NCC Group mapped the internet for vulnerable servers to gauge the potential
impact of this vulnerability. In July, 5945 (~94%) of all Serv-U (S)FTP services identified
on port 22 were potentially vulnerable. In October, three months after SolarWinds
released their patch, the number of potentially vulnerable servers is still significant at
2784 (66.5%).
The top countries with potentially vulnerable Serv-U FTP services at the time of writing
are
