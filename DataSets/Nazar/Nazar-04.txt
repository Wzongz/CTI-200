The campaign, which was previously attributed to Chinese threat actor Emissary Panda, which is also referred to as APT27, LuckyMouse, BRONZE UNION, and Threat Group 3390, is referenced in one of the files from the Shadow Brokers dump as SIG37. According to Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, a security researcher who previously worked for Kaspersky and Google, SIG37 in fact points to a previously unidentified cluster of activity that might be going back as far as 2008. He has not been able to link this activity to any known threat group. The researcher, who refers to the operation as ‘Nazar’, based on “debug paths left alongside Farsi resources in some of the malware droppers,” believes that the activity was centered around the 2010-2013 timeframe, based on submission times in VirusTotal. “Somehow, this operation found its way onto the NSA’s radar pre-2013,” Guerrero-Saade wrote in a blog post on Nazar. “As far as I can tell, it’s eluded specific coverage from the security industry.​The malware leverages libraries to implement screen grabbing, microphone recording, and keylogging features, while two custom resources, which are treated as type libraries and registered as OLE controls, can enumerate attached drives, traverse folder structures, and handle some C&C functionality. A kernel driver is used to sniff packets from the victim machine’s interfaces and parse them for specific strings, but the researcher says he could not identify what it is parsing.
