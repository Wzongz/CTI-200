            "Its operations have been documented by multiple cybersecurity companies over the past six years [1, 2, 3].Security researchers at Symantec say in a report today that Billbug, who they've been tracking since 2018, also targeted a certificate authority company, which would have allowed them to deploy signed malware to make it more difficult to detect or to decrypt HTTPS traffic.",
            "Some functionalities of the Hannotog backdoor include changing firewall settings to enable all traffic, establish persistence on the compromised machine, upload encrypted data, run CMD commands, and download files to the device.",
            "Symantec was able to pin the recent attacks to Billbug because the threat actor used two custom backdoors seen in some of their previous operations: Hannotog and Sagerunex.",
            "The most recent attacks were observed since at least March but the actor has been operating stealthily for more than a decade and it is believed to be a state-sponsored group working for China.",

            "Usually, after a high-profile incident in which cyber-espionage activities are revealed we witness a significant downtick in the group’s activities; such as with Russia and North Korea after the Podesta and South Korean bank hacks respectively."
