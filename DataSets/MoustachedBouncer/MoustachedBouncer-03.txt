MoustachedBouncer is a threat actor group believed to be based in Belarus and first published about by ESET in August 2023. The group has been noted for its sophisticated cyberespionage activities, particularly against foreign diplomats in Belarus. MoustachedBouncer is known to exploit access to Belarusian internet service providers (ISPs) to conduct "man in the middle" attacks on these foreign entities. This method of attack, also referred to as an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack, allows the threat actor to intercept and potentially alter communications between two parties without their knowledge. There are indications of a possible connection between MoustachedBouncer and another group called Winter Vivern. ESET reports this link with low confidence, suggesting that while there may be some evidence pointing towards this relationship, it is not yet strong enough to be considered definitive. Nevertheless, the potential association between these two groups adds an additional layer of complexity to the cybersecurity landscape and warrants further investigation. ESET also assesses with medium confidence that MoustachedBouncer aligns with Belarus interests. More intriguingly, the group is suspected of using a Russian-designed system for remote control access to all user communications known as SORM. This system has reportedly enabled MoustachedBouncer to issue HTTP redirection using a dropper developed in C#, named SharpDisco. If confirmed, this would highlight a significant level of technical expertise within the group and underscore the serious nature of the threat it poses.
