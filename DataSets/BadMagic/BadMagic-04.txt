BadMagic: new APT related to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict Since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, we have identified a significant number of geo-political cyber-attacks, as outlined in our overview of the cyber-attacks related to the conflict. Last October, we identified an active infection of government, agriculture and transportation organizations located in Donetsk, Lugansk and Crimea. The initial vector of compromise is unclear, but the details of the next stage imply the use of spear-phishing or something similar. The targets navigated to a URL pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web server. This archive contained two files: a decoy document (we discovered PDF, XLSX and DOCX versions) and a malicious LNK file with a double extension (e.g. PDF.LNK) which, when opened, results in infection. In several cases, the contents of the decoy document were directly related to the name of the malicious LNK, to trick the user into activating it The LNK file downloads and installs a PowerShell backdoor called “PowerMagic”, which in turn deploys a sophisticated modular framework called “CommonMagic”. We discovered CommonMagic plugins capable of stealing files from USB devices as well as taking screenshots and sending them to the threat actor.During our initial analysis, we were unable to find anything to connect the samples we found and the data used in the campaign to any previously known threat actor. However, our continuing investigations revealed more information about this threat, including links to other APT campaigns. You can find the details here.
