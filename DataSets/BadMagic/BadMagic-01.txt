New findings about a hacker group called ‘Bad Magic,’ which is linked to cyber attacks targeting companies in the Russia-Ukrainian conflict area, reveal that it may have been around for much longer than previously thought, according to leading cyber security firm Kaspersky.“In March 2023, we uncovered a previously unknown APT campaign in the region of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict that involved the use of PowerMagic and CommonMagic implants. However, at the time it was not clear which threat actor was behind the attack.“Since the release of our report about CommonMagic, we have been looking for additional clues that would allow us to learn more about this actor. As we expected, we have been able to gain a deeper insight into the Bad Magic story,” says Kaspersky. “While looking for implants bearing similarities with PowerMagic and CommonMagic, we identified a cluster of even more sophisticated malicious activities originating from the same threat actor.“What was most interesting about it is that its victims were located not only in the Donetsk, Lugansk and Crimea regions, but also in central and western Ukraine. Targets included individuals, as well as diplomatic and research organisations.”The campaign is characterised by the use of a novel modular framework codenamed CloudWizard, which features capabilities to take screenshots, record microphone, log keystrokes, grab passwords, and harvest Gmail inboxes.Bad Magic was first report in March 2023, detailing the group's use of a backdoor called PowerMagic (aka DBoxShell or GraphShell) and a modular framework dubbed CommonMagic in attacks targeting Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.
